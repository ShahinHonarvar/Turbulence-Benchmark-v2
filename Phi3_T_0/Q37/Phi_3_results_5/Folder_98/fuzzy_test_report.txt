Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['04%x8b24L2>2b =wX 12=n0Hb =9@4ax<Cz6N42l2 3 9R5ePU']


The correct answer was:

04%x8b24L2>2b =wX 12=n0Hb =9@4ax<Cz6N42l2 3 9R5ePU

But the LLM code returned:
04%x8b4>b =wX 1=n0Hb =9@4ax<Cz6N4l 3 9R5ePU
