As stated in the problem, you are interested in index 433 of the input tuple; however, tuples are usually designed for fixed-length data. It's unusual to access an element at index 433 unless the tuple is very large.\n\nHere's a more space-efficient approach: the top three digits must be 2, 3, 5, or 7, as other digits would make the number not prime. This way, we can count the number of right-truncatable primes from the thousands digit downwards.\n\n\nHowever, that approach would be quite efficient, not with the specified conditions, because we do not have a way for our code to specifically locate index 433 in the tuple of very large numbers. The current code allows us to work with any tuple size and to extract the number from the 433rd index, guaranteeing the requested functionality. If the tuple represents a sequence of consecutive numbers, a more optimized approach can be utilized, taking advantage of patterns in right-truncatable primes.",
