Write an elaborate Python class that follows the text specifications. The Python code should not contain any comments or docstrings. Your code must strictly adhere to the PEP8 style guide and run with Python 3. Please use type hints in your function signatures. The Python class code should be enclosed between triple backticks. <Craft a Python class called 'CoordConverter' that handles conversion between Cartesian coordinates (x, y) and Polar coordinates (r, \u03b8). The class must include:\n\n\n1. A constructor that takes optional keyword arguments `x` and `y` storing the Cartesian coordinates.\n\n2. A property method for each coordinate, returning the value with appropriate type hints.\n\n3. Methods `to_polar()` and `to_cartesian()` to convert the coordinate system, accounting for directional quadrant changes and handling edge cases carefully.\n\n4. Incorporate error handling to ensure given coordinate values are numeric and within the valid range for real numbers.\n\n5. Implement caching within the methods to improve the computational efficiency for repeated conversions.\n\n6. Implement dunder methods `__str__` and `__eq__` for string representation and equality comparison, following Python conventions.>",
