It takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n - This function first checks if the provided tuple is long enough for indices to be at least 70 and 200. If not, it returns an empty string.\n - It then assigns integer at index 70 and 200 from the provided tuple to variables 'a' and 'b' respectively. \n - The range between 'a + 1' and 'b' is created excluding the elements in the given range from the tuple. This is done through python's set difference operation.\n - In case if all integers within the range are present in the provided portion of the tuple, the variable `excluded` will be empty and the function will return an empty string.\n - A list comprehension is used to sum all the elements in the 'excluded' range.\n - Once the sum is calculated, the function checks if it's an odd number. If it is, it converts and returns the sum's binary representation without the '0b' prefix.\n - If the sum is not an odd number, it converts and returns the sum's hexadecimal representation without the '0x' prefix.\n - The representation is returned regardless of whether the letters are in lowercase or uppercase since the `hex` and `bin` functions in python return hexadecimal and binary strings with letters in uppercase by default.",
