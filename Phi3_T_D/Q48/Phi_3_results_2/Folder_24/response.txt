Stores the integers at indices 13 and 91 into 'a' and 'b' variables, using appropriate default values if indices exceed the tuple's boundaries.\n2. Calculates the sum of all integers between 'a+1' and 'b-1' which are not present in the given tuple.\n   - This is done by subtracting the set of elements in the tuple between indices 13 and 91 from the set of all integers between 'a+1' and 'b-1'.\n3. It then determines whether to return the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum based on the sum's parity.\n   - If the sum is odd, its binary representation is returned without the '0b' prefix.\n   - If the sum is even, its hexadecimal representation is returned without the '0x' prefix, and in uppercase if it begins with '0x'.\n4. If `sum_` is zero (i.e., all integers between 'a+1' and 'b-1' exist in the tuple), it returns an empty string.",
