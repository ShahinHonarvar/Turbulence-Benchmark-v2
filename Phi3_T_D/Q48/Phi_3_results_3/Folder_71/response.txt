Calculating the sum of integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not found between indices 20 and 35 of the input tuple. \n2. Checking if the resulting sum is odd or even.\n3. Returning the binary representation of the sum if it's odd (without the '0b' prefix) or the hexadecimal representation (without the '0x' prefix) if it's even.\n4. Ensuring that if all integers in the range are present in the tuple between indices 20 and 35, an empty string is returned.\n\nThe implementation utilizes set operations for efficient checking of presence and calculation of the sum and relies on Python's built-in `format` function to convert numbers to the desired representations.",
