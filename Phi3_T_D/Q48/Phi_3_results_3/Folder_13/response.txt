It then retrieves the values of `a` and `b` from the 46th and 91st index of the tuple, respectively. \n\nAfterwards, it calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b` which aren't in the given range of the tuple (between indices 46 and 91). We utilize a generator expression in conjunction with `range()` and `in` to identify the missing values while calculating the sum.\n\nThen, the function checks if the sum is an even number (by checking if the remainder of sum divided by 2 is 0). If even, it returns the hexadecimal string representation of the sum without the '0x' prefix. If the sum is odd, it returns the binary string representation of the sum without the '0b' prefix.",
