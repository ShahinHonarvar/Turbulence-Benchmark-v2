Inside the function, it extracts `a` and `b` from the tuple at positions 45 and 48 respectively.\n\nThen, it calculates the sum of all integers from `a+1` to `b-1` that are not present in the tuple specified by indices 45 to 48.\n\nIf the calculated sum is an odd number, the function uses the `bin` function to convert the sum to binary and slices the string to remove the \"0b\" prefix. Then, it returns the binary string.\n\nIf the calculated sum is an even number, the function uses the `hex` function to convert the sum to hexadecimal and slices the string to remove the \"0x\" prefix. Then, it returns the hexadecimal string.\n\nIf all integers from `a+1` to `b-1` are present in the specified range in the tuple, the sum becomes 0, and neither the `bin` nor the `hex` conversion will add any leading zeros. Therefore, the function will return an empty string.",
