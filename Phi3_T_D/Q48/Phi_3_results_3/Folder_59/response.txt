It then calculates the sum of all integers between `a + 1` and `b - 1` that are not included in the range between indices `1` and `10` within the tuple.\n\nAfter obtaining the missing sum, the function checks if it is an even or odd number. If the sum is even, it converts the sum to a hexadecimal representation (without the '0x' prefix) and returns it. If the sum is odd, it converts the sum to a binary representation (without the '0b' prefix) and returns it.\n\nIf all integers within the specified range are present in the tuple, the missing sum will be `0`, resulting in an empty string being returned.",
