The function `return_binary_or_hexa` takes a single tuple argument `t`.\n2. 'a' is the integer at index 71, and 'b' is the integer at index 92. Python uses 0-based indexing, so we need to adjust the indices 72 and 93.\n3. To find the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the range `t[72:93]`, we generate the range and take its difference from the set of these indices in the tuple `t` using set operations. The result is a set of integers not present, from which we sum up.\n4. The returned value depends on the parity of `missing_sum`. If it's even, we convert the sum to hexadecimal without the leading \"0x\". If odd, we convert it to binary without the leading \"0b\".",
