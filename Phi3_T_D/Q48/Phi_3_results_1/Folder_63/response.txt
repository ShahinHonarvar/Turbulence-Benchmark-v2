The function `return_binary_or_hexa` is defined to take a tuple `tup` as an argument.\n2. The integers at indices 81 and 86 of the tuple `tup` are assigned to variables `a` and `b`, respectively.\n3. A set difference operation is performed to determine the numbers not present in the segment between indices 81 and 86, and then their sum is calculated, stored in `missing_sum`.\n4. An `if` statement checks if `missing_sum` is even or odd.\n   - If even, the hexadecimal representation of `missing_sum` is calculated using the `hex()` function and slicing `[2:]` to remove the '0x' prefix, and returned.\n   - If odd, the binary representation of `missing_sum` is calculated using the `bin()` function and slicing `[2:]` to remove the '0b' prefix, and returned.\n5. If all numbers between `a + 1` and `b - 1` were present in the given segment of the tuple, `missing_sum` would be 0, which is also returned due to the early termination of the function in the `if` statement.",
