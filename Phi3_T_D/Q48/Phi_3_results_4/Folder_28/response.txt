Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. It assumes that you will pass in a tuple (denoted as `numbers`) containing nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n2. It retrieves the integers `a` and `b`, which are the integers stored at indices 86 and 99, respectively.\n3. It calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the slice of the tuple from index 86 to 99. It does this by taking the set difference between the range of numbers from `a + 1` to `b` and the slice of the tuple in question.\n4. Depending on whether the computed sum is odd or even, it returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum without the standard prefixes ('0b' for binary, '0x' for hexadecimal). The hexadecimal representation, if required, is also given in uppercase as specified.",
