Python uses 0-based indexing, thus indices 86 and 99 correspond to the 87th and 100th elements when traditional 1-based indexing is considered. However, the provided text specification does not use 0-based indexing, as it refers to \"index 86\" and \"index 99\". As such, I've adhered to the given instruction by interpreting these as 1-based indexing positions corresponding to Python's 0-based indexing. If this is a mistake and a 0-based index was intended, the code can simply be adjusted by changing `[86:99]` to `[85:98]`. \n\nDepending on how the tuple is defined, you may also encounter an `IndexError` if the tuple does not have enough elements to accommodate the indices mentioned in the problem statement. If it's possible that the tuple could be of a size less than 100, extra error handling should be added.",
