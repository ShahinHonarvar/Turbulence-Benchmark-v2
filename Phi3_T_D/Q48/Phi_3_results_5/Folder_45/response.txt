We define a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n\n2. We declare two variables: `a` is the integer at index 30, and `b` is the integer at index 200 of the input tuple.\n\n3. To find the sum of all integers not in the specified range, we calculate the total sum of numbers from `a + 1` to `b`, including `b`, and then subtract from this sum the sum of the numbers in our specified range (i.e., from the 31st to the 200th element, both inclusive, using Python's 0-indexing).\n\n4. If `missing_sum` is zero, meaning all integers were found between indices 30 and 200 and we have no missing numbers in the sum, we return an empty string as per specifications.\n\n5. If the `missing_sum` is not zero, we check if it's an odd number. If it is odd, we convert the `missing_sum` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function, strip off the leading \"0b\" using slicing (`[2:]`), and then return this string.\n\n6. If the `missing_sum` is even, we convert the `missing_sum` to its hexadecimal representation using the `hex()` function, strip off the leading \"0x\" using slicing `[2:]`, and then convert the string to lowercase using `.lower()`, before returning this string. This satisfies the requirement to use either lowercase or uppercase hex letters.",
