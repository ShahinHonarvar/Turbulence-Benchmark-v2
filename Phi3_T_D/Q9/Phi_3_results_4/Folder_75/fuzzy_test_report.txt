Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-209, 52, 283, 407, 335, -340, 12, 53, -73, -88, -264, -8, 454, 5, 74, -275, -288, 56, -193, -217, -26, -31, 227, 514, -26, 404, 438, 341, 121, 202, -58, 8, -549, 448, 91, 333, -105, 401, 531, -266, -282, 281, -240, -431, 450, -112, 252, -440, 476, 312, 513, 442, 357, 241, 184, -462, 130, -535, -198]


The correct answer was:

[-535]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
