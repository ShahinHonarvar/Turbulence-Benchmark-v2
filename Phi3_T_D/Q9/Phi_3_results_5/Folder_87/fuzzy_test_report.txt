Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-31, -275, 12, -240, -105, -282, -440, 74, -8, -26, 283, 53, 341, 454, 121, 531, 401, 450, 91, -88, 202, -549, -193, -288, 357, 404, 5, 281, -73, 184, -266, -340, -112, 130, 438, -26, 442, 241, -209, -217, -264, 335, 252, 407, 312, 513, -535, 448]


The correct answer was:

[241, -209, -217, 335, 407, 513, -535]

But the LLM code returned:
[241, -209, -217, 335, 407, 513]
