For each string, count the characters regardless of their case using the `count_chars` inner function. It ignores non-alphabetic characters based on `c.isalpha()`.\n\n2. Use a Counter to transform each string into a set of character counts, which allows for easy comparisons.\n\n3. Store the strings in a dictionary called `anagrams`, using the character count as the key.\n\n4. If there's a key already present, it means we have encountered an anagram of a previous entry, so add the string to the list. Otherwise, create a new entry in the dictionary with the current string.\n\n5. Iterate through the list of values in the `anagrams` dictionary and count the number of possible anagram pairs in each list. If any list contains more than two strings, calculate the number of pairs and add it to the `count_pairs` variable.\n\n6. If there are more than 79 pairs, return False. Otherwise, return True.",
