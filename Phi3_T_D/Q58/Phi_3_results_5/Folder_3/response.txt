The count of elements in a submatrix is always determined by its size (rows * columns), so there can never be a submatrix containing exactly 54 integers unless the original matrix has dimensions that allow for that specific submatrix size. Therefore, the condition `submatrix.size == n` will most likely never be True unless `n` corresponds to the product of the dimensions of a potential submatrix.",
