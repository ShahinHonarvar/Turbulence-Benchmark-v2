If a sublist's product equals `n`, it is added to the `sublists` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the computed list of sublists.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes a simple concatenation to form the circular list which introduces duplicates naturally. Running through the list in this way and checking contiguous subsequences effectively covers all possible combinations without the need for explicit duplicate removal or central order verification.",
