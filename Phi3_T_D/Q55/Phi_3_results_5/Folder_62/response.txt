However, purposefully creating a truly circular list data structure in Python that respects the properties outlined in the specification isn't straightforward, as Python lists do not enforce circularity. The code above treats any list as circular by treating the end as connected to the start without explicitly wrapping the indices. If the circular aspect should be accounted for in a different manner, the solution might need adjustments.",
