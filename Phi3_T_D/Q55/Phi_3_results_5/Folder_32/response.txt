Initialize an empty list `result` to hold all sublists (sub-sequences) with a product equal to 76.\n\n2. Iterate through each element of the circular list using a for loop. For each element, calculate the product of contiguous integers starting from that element.\n\n3. For each contiguous sublist, check if the product equals 76. If it does, add a copy of the sublist to the `result` list since we cannot alter it during the iteration.\n\n4. Advance the index in a circular manner (using modulus) to traverse the circular list.\n\n5. Continue the process until all sublists containing the current element have been checked.\n\n6. Return the `result` list, containing all sublists with a product equal to 76.\n\nNote: The given circular list is assumed to be in a standard list data structure where the head and tail are not explicitly connected. If the circular list is to be implemented using a separate data structure (like a linked list), the logic would have to change to iterate through the circular linked list instead.",
