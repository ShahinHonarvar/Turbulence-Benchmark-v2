However, the requirement for finding sublists with a product equal to -65 could mean no solution exists for a given input because the product of contiguous integers is always positive or zero, except if you allow the inclusion of negative pairs. Since that's not a standard interpretation, the function is not optimized for this \"product equal to -65\" scenario.",
