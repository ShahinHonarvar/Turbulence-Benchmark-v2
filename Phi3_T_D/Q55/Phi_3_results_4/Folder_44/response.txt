This helper function then finds sublists of the given size with a product equal to 29 by adding elements from the head, wrapping around the circular list as needed. If a valid sublist is found, it's added to the results list. The function then removes elements from the start of the sublist until the product is less than or equal to the target, ensuring that all contiguous sublists with the correct product are found.",
