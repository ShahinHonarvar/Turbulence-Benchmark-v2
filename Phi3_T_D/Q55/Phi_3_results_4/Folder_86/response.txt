If yes, it's added to the result set.\n- If the product exceeds `n`, elements are removed from the beginning of the sublist until the product is less than or equal to `n`.\n- Elements that are at the start of the sublist may lead to a valid sublist when multiplied with the current product. It's checked and added if needed.\n- This way, all possible sublists whose product equals the target are generated and returned.",
