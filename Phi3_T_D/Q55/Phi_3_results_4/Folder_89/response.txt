This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3) where n is the length of the list because of the nested loops and repeated calculations of products. To make this code more efficient, we could precompute the products and only look for factors of 57, but since the question did not specify optimization constraints, the above implementation directly addresses the problem as stated.",
