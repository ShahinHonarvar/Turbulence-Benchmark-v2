The `itertools.cycle` function is used to iterate over the list in a circular manner. Then, for each possible starting point in the list and for each possible length of sublists (from 1 to the length of the list), we create a sublist and check its product. If the product is equal to 15, the sublist is added to the result list. If no such sublist exists, an empty list is returned.",
