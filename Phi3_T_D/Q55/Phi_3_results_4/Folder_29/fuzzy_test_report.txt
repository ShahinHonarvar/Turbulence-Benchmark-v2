Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[1, 3, 3, 5, 1, 15, 15, 5]


The correct answer was:

[[3, 5], [3, 5, 1], [1, 15], [15], [15], [5, 1, 3]]

But the LLM code returned:
[[5, 1, 3], [5, 1, 3], [5, 1, 3], [5, 1, 3]]
