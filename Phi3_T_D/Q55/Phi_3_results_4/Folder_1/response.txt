In a circular linked list, the concept of size may not be directly available, which complicates the problem without more context (e.g., if it's a mathematical circular list or if there's a limit to how many items the list can contain). Therefore, the function `half_size` is assumed to be an auxiliary function that estimates the size of the contiguous sublist to manage continuity in a circular list fashion, but its implementation and usage here don't fully align with the problem's constraints because of the lack of clear size information for the circular list.\n\nA more accurate approach to solving this problem would require additional information about how the circular list is represented or if there's a way to determine the \"next\" element without a clear index. Without such information, the solution could become more complex or less precise.",
