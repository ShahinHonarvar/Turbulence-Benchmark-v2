It calculates the product of the elements and checks if it equals the target (-81). If the product is greater than the target or the first zero element is found, it breaks out of the inner loop to avoid unnecessary calculations. The code also checks for duplicate sublists when the list is circular by breaking the outer loop if the current index is the last index.\n\nThe second code snippet uses a more efficient approach for dealing with the circularity of the array. It iterates through the array, treating the first element as the starting point until the end of the array and appending the elements in a circular manner. The product is continuously updated as the next element is multiplied to it. This reduces the number of operations required to find the sublist that meets the criteria. However, care must be taken to handle the case especially when zero exists in the subarray which may cause early termination.",
