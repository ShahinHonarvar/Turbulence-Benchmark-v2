Generate Python code strictly based on the requirements provided and ensure the following additional constraints are met:\n\n\n1. Use a class instead of a function.\n\n2. Implement error handling to ensure that the method can only process positive integers and raise a ValueError with a message \"Input must be a positive integer\" otherwise.\n\n3. The class must contain an initializer that accepts the integer and stores it as an instance variable called `number`.\n\n4. Include a docstring for the class and the method that explains what they do.\n\n5. Limit the use of spaces within lines to not more than 80 characters.\n\n6. Use meaningful variable and method names that adhere to the snake_case naming convention.\n\n7. The list returned should not contain duplicates and should be sorted in ascending order.\n\n8. The method should have a time complexity no worse than O(n), where n is the number to check for divisors.\n\n\n<Develop a class called 'IntegerDivisorFinder' that includes a method 'find_divisors_in_range' which will accept an integer, ensure it's positive and find all divisors of the integer that lie between 57 and 86. The method should return a sorted list of these divisors without duplicates. If the integer doesn't have any divisors in that range, the method should return an empty list. The method should meet all additional constraints provided.>",
