(ASCII 33) and '}' (ASCII 125), so we know which characters to exclude.\n\n2. `return ''.join(c for i, c in enumerate(s) if not (170 < i < 195) or c not in exclude_range)`:\n   The return statement iterates through the `s` string. For each character, It first checks if the index of the character (affected by `enumerate(s)`) is NOT between 170 and 195 either by excluding all characters within this range, or if the character is not in the `exclude_range`. If either condition is true, the character is added to the final string. Then, by using `''.join()`, we concatenate all the eligible characters into one final string.",
