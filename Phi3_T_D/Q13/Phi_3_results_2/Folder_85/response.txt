You are requested to develop an algorithm in Java that identifies any text within a given set of messages where inadvertent disclosure of privileged information occurs. The algorithm should accept an input of 'Message' objects, each with a 'content' String and a 'date' Timestamp. The output should be a List of 'Message' objects deemed potentially problematic. The messages are deemed problematic if they contain specific legal terms or client names that typically indicate constituting privileged information. Additionally, the algorithm must timestamp each identified message with a 'review flag' date immediately following the original message's date. Ensure the algorithm handles null inputs gracefully, prioritizes underprivileged messages, and documents any exceptions with appropriate error handling. Craft your Java function within a class named 'PrivilegeReview'.>",
