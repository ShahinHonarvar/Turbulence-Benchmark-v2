It is a sophisticated algorithm which extends the current palindrome checking process. Implementing and integrating the Manacher's Algorithm into this code will significantly reduce the time complexity. For someone relatively new to algorithmic optimisation, it might pose a challenge.\n```\n```\n\nThe Manacher's Algorithm is an advanced topic and its implementation would require a bit more complex code than what was covered in the snippets above.",
