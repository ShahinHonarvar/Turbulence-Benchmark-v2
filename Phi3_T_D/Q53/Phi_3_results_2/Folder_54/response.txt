The `extend_palindrome` function finds the longest palindrome centered at a given index `i` by expanding in both directions until the palindrome ends or characters at the ends don't match. This part of the solution operates in O(n) time complexity.\n\nThe main function, `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n`, uses a nested loop to process each character of the input string `s`, treating it as the center of potential palindromes. This allows the detection of palindromes even in the case of even length palindromes. By considering each character and its neighbor as potential centers, this method ensures that all palindromes with centers within the string are found.\n\nSince the function checks for palindromes of length greater than 73, extending with even length palindromes ensures we correctly capture all palindromes of interest from 74 characters and up. The check against adding palindromes to `set_palindromes` is done only to make sure we do not work on palindromes we have already checked, especially in a case where the string has repeating substrings that could yield identical palindromes at different starting points.\n\nFinally, the function returns a set of all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 74 found in the input string, with case insensitivity ensured by converting the input string to lowercase at the start of the function.",
