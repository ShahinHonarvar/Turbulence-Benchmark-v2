It then creates a new list consisting of integers located at indices 86 to 98, as the range is exclusive. For each integer in this sublist, the function checks whether the integer is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2). If the integer is odd, it is included in the resulting list, which is then returned. If no odd integers are found in the range, an empty list is returned.",
