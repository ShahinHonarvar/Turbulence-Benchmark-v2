(Note: indices in Python are 0-based, so this is actually indexes 29 to 98, which means characters at indexes 30 to 99 are accessed in the substring.)\n- The allowed characters for valid palindromes are all English letters, both in lowercase and uppercase.\n- We initialize an empty set `palindromes` where we will store unique palindromes found.\n- We then iterate over lengths from 6 to 9 inclusive.\n- For each length, we iterate through the substring to create candidate strings of that length.\n- We check if each character in the candidate is a valid English letter and if the candidate is a palindrome.\n- If the candidate meets the criteria, it is added to the `palindromes` set.\n- Finally, the set containing the unique palindromes is returned.",
