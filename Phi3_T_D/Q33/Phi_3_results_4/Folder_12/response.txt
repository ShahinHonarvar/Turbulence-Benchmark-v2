Since only uppercase vowels are valid within this range, the code technically only includes 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' if they appear. However, this is a bit misleading, as there are no uppercase letters between 'Z' (U+005A) and '}' (U+007F) that are letters at all, let alone vowels. This solution, therefore, wouldn't produce a typical list of vowels, but fulfills the unique requirements specified.\n\n```\n\n```",
