Assuming this part of the specification aims to indicate greater than the uppercase 'A', here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(s):\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    start, end = 11, 53\n    return [c for c in s[start:end] if c in vowels and 'G' < c <= 'W']\n```\n\nBoth snippets of code do not account for the uppercase characters since it wasn't specified, but if uppercase is needed, the comparison can be adjusted, and the list comprehension can filter based on both uppercase and lowercase vowels.",
