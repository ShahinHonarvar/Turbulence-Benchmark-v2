Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[1, 2, 2, 23, 1, 46, 46, 23]


The correct answer was:

[[2, 23], [2, 23, 1], [1, 46], [46], [46], [23, 1, 2]]

But the LLM code returned:
[[2, 23], [2, 23, 1], [1, 46], [46], [46]]
