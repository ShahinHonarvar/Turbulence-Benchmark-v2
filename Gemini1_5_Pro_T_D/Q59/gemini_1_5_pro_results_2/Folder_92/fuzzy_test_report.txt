Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758, 622, 258, 910]


The correct answer was:

[2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, 47, 53, 67, 73, 83, 97, 113, 137, 167, 173, 197, 223, 283]

But the LLM code returned:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 15, 17, 22, 23, 25, 27, 32, 33, 35, 37, 42, 43, 45, 47, 52, 53, 55, 57, 62, 63, 65, 67, 72, 73, 75, 77, 82, 83, 85, 87, 92, 93, 95, 97, 113, 117, 123, 137, 143, 147, 153, 167, 173, 183, 197, 213, 217, 223, 237, 243, 247, 253, 267, 273, 283, 297]
