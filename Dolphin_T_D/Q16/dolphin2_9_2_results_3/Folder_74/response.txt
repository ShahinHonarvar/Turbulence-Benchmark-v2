Then, it sums them all using the `sum()` function.\n\nRemember that in Python, the `sum()` function returns 0 when called with an empty list as an argument, so if there are no even integers in the specified range, the function will return 0 as per the problem statement's requirement.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730687400, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
