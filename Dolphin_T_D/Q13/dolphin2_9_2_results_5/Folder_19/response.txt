Here is the newly updated one as per the current specs:\n\nIn the revised task, you need to write a function called `find_second_largest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as an argument, and the function should return the second largest number within the range of indices 3 to 5 (inclusive) in the list. If the list has fewer than 6 elements or if this range is not distinct, the function should return `None`.\n\nTo do this, the function will select the elements at the indices 3 to 5 from the input list. It will then check if these numbers are distinct. If they are, it will find the two largest numbers amongst them and return the second largest number. If they are not distinct, it will return `None`. If the list has fewer than 6 elements, the function will also return `None`.\n\nHere is the Python code that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_largest_num(lst):\n    """\n    Selects the elements at the indices 3 to 5 from the input list.\n    Checks if these elements are distinct.\n    If they are, it finds the two largest numbers amongst them and returns the second largest number.\n    If they are not distinct or if the list has fewer than 6 elements, it returns \'None\'.\n    """\n\n    # If the list is not long enough, return None\n    if len(lst) < 6:\n        return None\n\n    subset = lst[3:6]\n\n    # If the subset is not distinct, return None\n    if len(set(subset)) != len(subset):\n        return None\n    \n    # Get the two largest numbers from the subset\n    max_num = max(subset)\n    subset.remove(max_num)\n    \n    if len(subset) == 0:\n        return None\n        \n    return second_max_num\n```', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730678906, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
