Then, it creates the `numbers` set with the numbers in the tuple from index 27 to 96. The `total` variable is set to the sum of numbers in the range from `a+1` to `b-1` that are not in the `numbers` set. If the `total` is odd, the binary representation of `total` is returned, excluding the '0b' prefix. If `total` is even, the hexadecimal representation is returned, in uppercase and excluding the '0x' prefix. If all numbers from `a+1` to `b-1` inclusive are in the `numbers` set, an empty string is returned.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730791180, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
