It then checks for the sum of all numbers from a+1 to b-1 that aren't in the tuple, with 'a' and 'b' being located at the 20th and 35th index respectively. If the sum is an odd number, it will return the binary representation of the number (with no '0b' prefix). And if it's an even number, it will return the hexadecimal representation of the number (with no '0x' prefix). If all numbers from a+1 to b-1 are present in the tuple, it will return an empty string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730790514, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
