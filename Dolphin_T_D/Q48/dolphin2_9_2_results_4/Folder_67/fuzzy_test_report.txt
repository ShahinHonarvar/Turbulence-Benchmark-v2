Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 48, 53, 57, 58, 60, 62, 71, 74, 77, 79, 85, 93, 94, 100, 102, 105, 107, 108, 117, 121, 127, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 139, 140, 141, 143, 148, 150, 151, 152, 155, 156, 157, 159, 164, 165, 166, 170, 172, 174, 175, 176, 178, 179, 181, 182, 184, 186, 189, 191, 192, 193, 195, 197, 198, 199, 203, 207, 208, 210, 211, 213, 214, 215, 217, 220, 225, 227, 229, 231, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 244, 245, 247, 248, 249, 254]


The correct answer was:

1010100101111

But the LLM code returned:
1010010101111
