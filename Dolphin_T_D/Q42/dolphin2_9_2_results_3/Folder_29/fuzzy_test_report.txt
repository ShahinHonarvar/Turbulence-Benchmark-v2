Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[583, 477, 259, 758, 549, 282, 805, 325, 434, 618, 15, 902, 244, 261, 421, 494, 611, 310, 304, 472, 505, 913, 477, 101, 966, 810, 867, 511, 2, 982, 825, 730, 719, 784, 865, 399, 908, 909, 251, 668, 756, 405]


The correct answer was:

{2, 59}

But the LLM code returned:
{3, 53}
