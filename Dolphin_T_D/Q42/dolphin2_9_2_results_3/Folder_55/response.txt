While `i` is less than the square root of `n`, if `n` is divisible by `i`, `n` is divided by `i` and `i` is added to the set of factors; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1. This process continues until `i` is greater than the square root of `n`. If `n` is greater than 1 after the loop, it is a prime factor and is added to the set. \n\nThe `prime_factors` function then calls `prime_factors_of_number` on the number at index 21 in the input list and returns the result.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730776336, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
