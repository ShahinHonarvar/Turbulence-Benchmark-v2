Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[370, -28, -309, -358, 417, 464, 227, -421, -121]


The correct answer was:

[-309, -358, 417, 464, 227]

But the LLM code returned:
[-309, -358, 417, 464, 227, -421]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

[312, -105, 91, -217, 283, -88, -26, -266, 12]
