Instead, it means inserting at the 7th index position in the list, and shifting everything else after that index one place to the right.\n\nThis solution splits the list into two at index 7 with lst[:7] and lst[7:]. The former will contain the first 7 elements of the list, and the latter will contain the rest of the list.\n\nThen, the solution adds the [1, 7] to the end of the first part of the list (before the 7th index) and adds the second part of the list (after the 7th index) to the end of that. This effectively inserts [1, 7] at the 7th index.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730702286, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
