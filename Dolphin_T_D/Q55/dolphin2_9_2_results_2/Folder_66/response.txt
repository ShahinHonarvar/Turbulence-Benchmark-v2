Its time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the size of the given list.\n\nThe function creates a new sublist (sublist = lst[i:(i + j + 1) % length]) whenever the product of the numbers in that sublist equals 78 (if product == 78). It then appends this sublist to the result list (sublists).\n\nIt iterates over the list in a circular fashion, such that the product of each possible group of numbers is computed efficiently. The product of the numbers in each sublist is computed incrementally, as a cumulative product (product *= lst[(i + j) % length]).\n\nIf the product equals 78, the sublist is added to the result. It keeps track of the start index of the current sublist (i) and the size of the current sublist (j) to compute the sublist boundaries (lst[i:(i + j + 1) % length]).\n\nFinally, the function returns the list of all found sublists. If no sublist is found, the function simply returns an empty list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730809174, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
