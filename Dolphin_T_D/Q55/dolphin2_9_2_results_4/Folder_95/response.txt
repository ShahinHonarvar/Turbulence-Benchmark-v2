If this total product is not equal to 28, we know that there can\'t be any sublist whose product is 28, and we thus immediately return an empty list. Otherwise we proceed with the function.\n   \n- We create a "circular" version of the list by extending it with a copy of itself. This allows us to easily check all possible sublists of the original list.\n   \n- We then check all possible sublists of the circular list. For each sublist, we compute the product of all its elements. If this product is equal to 28, we append the sublist to a list of results.\n   \n- After going through all possible sublists, we return the list of results.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730810579, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
