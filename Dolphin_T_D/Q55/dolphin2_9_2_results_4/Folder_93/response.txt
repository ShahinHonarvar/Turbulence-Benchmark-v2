Then, a single pass is done over the list. We maintain a running product of elements in the list. If the product becomes -91, we append the sublist ending at this point to our answer. If it becomes larger than -91, we reset our product to 1. These steps ensure that we only maintain sublists ending in -91.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730810566, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
