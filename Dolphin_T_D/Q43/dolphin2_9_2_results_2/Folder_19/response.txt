In this function, we initialize an empty list 'prime_numbers' to store the prime numbers in the given range.\nWe then iterate through the numbers in the range of indices 21 to 97 (both inclusive). For each number, we check if it is greater than 1. If it is, we further check if it is prime by trying to divide it by all numbers less than it and greater than 1. If none of these numbers divide the current number, we add the number to the list 'prime_numbers' of prime numbers.\nOnce we have checked all numbers in the range, we return the sorted list of prime numbers. If no prime numbers were found in the range, the function returns an empty list.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730778163, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
