However, I have written the function as it is probably meant, considering the elements at any positions between index 23 and 23 (both inclusive). The notation list[23:24] is a little strange in this context as it usually indicates a slice of the list from positions 23 to 24 (exclusive), but here it is treated as the element at position 23.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730774740, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
