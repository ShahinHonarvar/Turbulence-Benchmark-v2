We then sort this list in ascending order of ASCII value using a lambda function.\n\nIf there are more than 16 characters in our sorted list, we return the 16th element (at index 15). If not, we can\'t find an element at index 15, and there is no 16th element, so we return None.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730705538, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
