The Python code will define a new function called 'if_contains_anagrams'. This function will receive as input a list of strings. It will examine if there are at least 39 pairs of anagrams within the list. It will disregard anagrams with a length of less than three. It will also disregard case when comparing the strings.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(lst):\n    from collections import Counter\n    from itertools import combinations\n    \n    anagram_pairs = 0\n    \n    for word1, word2 in combinations(lst, 2):\n        if len(word1) < 3 or len(word2) < 3:\n            continue\n        if sorted(word1.lower()) == sorted(word2.lower()):\n            anagram_pairs += 1\n            \n    return anagram_pairs >= 39\n```\n\nThis function uses the collections and itertools modules from Python's standard library. It checks the list for any combinations of two words, or pairs, and if those pairs are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are identified by comparing the sorted lists of characters in each word, ignoring case (with the 'lower' function). The sorted list of characters is a common method to check anagrams. If there are at least 39 such pairs, the function returns 'True'; otherwise, the function returns 'False'.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730794630, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
