The "filter_chars" function accepts a string as its sole input. It then constructs the list of characters to filter, defined as characters occurring between indices 31 and 38 inclusive, and being between \';\' and \'g\' in the ASCII table. This list is then used to filter out all instances of these characters from the original string. The order of all characters is maintained, and the altered string is returned.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730758933, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
