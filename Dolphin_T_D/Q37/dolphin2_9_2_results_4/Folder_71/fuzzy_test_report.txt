Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['+x5r99UZS*eY  =&eVD$8% s3F0qsz38B>8BR C&7h7P=192Vh$2l=H<2785$=60h02&&7V  3>kc  1  37%4d1=Y>f2K%67*  9d']


The correct answer was:

+x5rUZS*eY  &eVD$% s3F0qsz3 &2V$2lH<25$6002&&V  3kc    3%4dYf2K%6*  d

But the LLM code returned:
+xr*  &$% sqsz &$l$&&      %%*
