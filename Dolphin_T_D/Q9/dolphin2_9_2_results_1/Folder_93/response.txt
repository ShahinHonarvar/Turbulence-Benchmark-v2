This function has to return a list that includes all odd integers from index 75 to index 94 (both inclusive) of the passed list. If the specified range does not contain any odd integers, the function should return an empty list. The written Python function fulfills these requirements. It uses list comprehension to iterate through the range from 75 to 94 in the given list. It includes in the result only those numbers that are odd, that is, they leave a remainder when divided by 2.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730672004, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
