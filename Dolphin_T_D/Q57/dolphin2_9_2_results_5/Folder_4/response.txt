The construction of the matrix 'pit' allows us to access the sum of elements of any submatrix in constant time. Then, for each cell of the matrix, we look for all possible submatrices that can be made with this cell as a bottom-right corner and check if the sum is 87.\n\nThis code handles the case where the submatrices can overlap. If a submatrix can't overlap (that is, it has to be a distinct set of elements), the problem becomes much harder and can't be solved in a simple way.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730815955, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
