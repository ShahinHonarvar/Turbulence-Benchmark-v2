The outer two loops iterate over the possible starting points (i,j) of the submatrix, and the inner two loops iterate over the range of ending points (k,l) of the submatrix. Submatrix with starting point (i,j) and ending point (k,l) is represented as matrix[i:k, j:l].\n\nIn each iteration, we calculate the sum of the integers in the current submatrix. If the sum equals 17, we append the submatrix to the 'result' list.\n\nFinally, when all submatrices have been checked, we return the 'result' list. If no submatrix with sum 17 was found, the list would be empty.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730814647, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
