It then gets the shape of the matrix and enters into four nested for loops. These loops iterate through every combination of rows and columns in the matrix starting from every element. This forms a "submatrix" each time which is a smaller matrix made up of the elements from the original matrix. It then checks if the sum of the elements in this new submatrix equals 8. If it does, the submatrix is added to the list of submatrices. Finally, when it has looped through all possible submatrices, it returns the list of successful ones. If no such submatrix is found, an empty list is returned.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730813952, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
