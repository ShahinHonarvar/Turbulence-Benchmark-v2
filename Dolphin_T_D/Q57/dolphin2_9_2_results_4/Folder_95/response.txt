This is accomplished by using two nested for loops for the row indices and two nested for loops for the column indices. The sum of every submatrix is computed using numpy's sum function which sums all the elements of the matrix. If the sum is 19, it appends the submatrix to the result list. Finally, the function returns the list of all such submatrices. If no submatrix with sum 19 is found, the function returns an empty list.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730815905, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
