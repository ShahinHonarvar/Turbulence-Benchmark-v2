It traverses each element of the matrix and increments the counter whenever an element that equals 57 is found. It also checks the elements of the submatrix beneath and to the right of the current element which also equal 57. The counter value is then returned, if no such submatrix is found, 0 is returned.\n\nRemember, this python solution is based on the assumption that the occurrence of '57' in original matrix is always 1 and the order of elements is not given. If multiple '57' occurs in a row or column, solution has to be modified accordingly.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730818015, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
