If it is, the function then returns an empty string because it's impossible to have a palindrome of length 76 if the input string is shorter than 76 characters. It then converts the input string to lowercase letters. This ensures that palindromes are found in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nThen, the function iterates over the characters in the string. For each character, it checks if the substring from the current character to the character 76 positions later (inclusive of both) is a palindrome (which means it reads the same forwards as backwards). If it is, it adds that substring to the set 'palindromes'. After going through all the characters, it returns the set of palindromes.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n*k), where n is the length of the string and k is the length of the substring we're checking (76 in this case).", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730799266, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
