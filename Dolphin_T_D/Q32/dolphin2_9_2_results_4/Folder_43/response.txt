If the condition holds, we replace the character 't' with the string 'G'. Otherwise, the character remains the same. 'G' is inserted for t's in the word that are not followed by h's. Finally, we ensure the last character is inclusive by adding s[-1:] at the end of the return string. The loop runs in odd and even indexes separately to skip the 'h' after 't'.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730717501, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
