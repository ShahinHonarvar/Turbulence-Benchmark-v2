The 'i+1' reference checks the character immediately following 'c' in the string. If 'c' is an 'O' and the character succeeding it is not an 'O', it returns an 'O'. If 'c' is an 'O' and the character succeeding it is an 'O', it returns 'c' (the original character) concatenated with the inserted 'O'. If 'c' isn't an 'O', it just returns 'c'. Therefore, the resulting string will have an 'O' inserted immediately succeeding any occurrence of 'O'.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730716211, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
