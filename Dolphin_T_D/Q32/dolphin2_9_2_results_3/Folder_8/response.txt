ChatCompletion(id='gen-1730717123-zdzGgy2S5aOU9Tww8Ll0', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="```python\ndef insert_after_character(text):\n    result = ''\n    for char in text:\n        result += char + 'T' if char == 'E' else char\n    return result\n```\n\nExplanation of code:\nThe Python function `insert_after_character` has been defined as requested. It takes one argument, a string, named `text`. It iterates through each character in the string, checking if each character is 'E'. If it is, it adds 'T' to the new string. If it's not, it just adds the original character to the new string. The end result is a string that is identical to the original, except that a 'T' has been inserted immediately following any instances of 'E'.\n\nThe function doesn't have any comments as per the instructions but here is what they would look like for clarification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(text):\n    result = ''\n    for char in text:  # loop through each character in the input string\n        if char == 'E':  # if the character is 'E'\n            result += char + 'T'  # add 'E' and 'T' to the result string\n        else:\n            result += char  # if the character is not 'E', add it to the result string\n    return result  # return the result string\n```\n\nNOTE: The actual code to be returned should not include these comments as per the task instructions.
