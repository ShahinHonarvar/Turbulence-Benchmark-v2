In the function, we start with an empty set and for each argument, we perform the union operation on the current `result` set and the argument set (& `|=` is an in-place union operation). The result of this operation is a set that contains all elements from both sets. That way, we continually build up a set that contains all elements from all argument sets. This set will be the smallest set such that all argument sets are subsets of it.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730753506, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
