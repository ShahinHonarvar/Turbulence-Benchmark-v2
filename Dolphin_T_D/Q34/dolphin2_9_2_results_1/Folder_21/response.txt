Then the function should find the smallest set that includes all these sets as subsets and return it. \n\nHowever, it is practically impossible to create a function with such a large number of parameters in Python. One thing we can do is to create a function with an arbitrary number of parameters using Python's feature of variable-length arguments. \n\nAt the same time, finding the smallest set that includes all these sets as subsets is equivalent to find the union of all these sets.\n\nHere's a solution with an arbitrary number of parameters:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set.union(*args)\n```\n\nTo find the union of 851 or any other number of sets, you can pass them as arguments to this function. For example:\n\n```python\nset1 = {1, 2, 3}\nset2 = {2, 3, 4}\nset3 = {3, 4, 5}\nresult = find_original_set(set1, set2, set3)\nprint(result)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n```\n\nCreating a function with exactly 851 parameters is not feasible and it is not recommended as it goes against Python's design and it wouldn't be good for readability or managing code.\n\nNote: Python's built-in function `union` returns the union of two sets, and the `*` operator is used to unpack the arguments out of a list or other container. In this case, the operator `*` is used to unpack the sets from the `args` tuple.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730752280, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
