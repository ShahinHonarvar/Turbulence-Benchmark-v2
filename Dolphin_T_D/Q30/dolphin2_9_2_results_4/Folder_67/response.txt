It then traverses the string and checks every character. If a character is 'j', it replaces it with a '1' followed by 'j'. If it's not 'j', it leaves the character as is. Finally, it joins all the transformed characters back together into a string and returns it. This ensures that the function returns a string that is identical to the inputstring except that the character '1' has been inserted immediately before any occurrences of character 'j'.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730709739, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
