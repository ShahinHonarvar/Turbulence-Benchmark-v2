If no such number exists, then we have to return 0. The Python function to be named 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' takes one argument, which is a list of integers. \n\nNow let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(lst):\n    s = 0\n    for i in range(315, 935):\n        if i in lst:\n            if i % -897 == 0 or i % -556 == 0:\n                s += i\n    return s\n```\nThis function works as follows: First it iterates over the specified range using a for-loop. For every index in this range, it checks whether the corresponding integer exists in the provided list. If it does and it is divisible by either -897 or -556, it is added to the sum 's'. Finally, this sum is returned. If no such integer exists, the function will return 0, as required.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730691287, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
