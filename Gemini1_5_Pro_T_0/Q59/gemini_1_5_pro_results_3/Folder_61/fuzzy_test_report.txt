Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289]


The correct answer was:

[223, 197, 173, 167, 137, 113, 97, 83, 73, 67, 53, 47, 43, 37, 23, 17, 13, 7, 5, 3, 2]

But the LLM code returned:
[253, 247, 243, 237, 223, 217, 213, 207, 205, 203, 202, 197, 183, 173, 167, 153, 147, 143, 137, 123, 117, 113, 107, 105, 103, 102, 97, 95, 93, 92, 87, 85, 83, 82, 77, 75, 73, 72, 67, 65, 63, 62, 57, 55, 53, 52, 47, 45, 43, 42, 37, 35, 33, 32, 27, 25, 23, 22, 17, 15, 13, 12, 7, 5, 3, 2]
