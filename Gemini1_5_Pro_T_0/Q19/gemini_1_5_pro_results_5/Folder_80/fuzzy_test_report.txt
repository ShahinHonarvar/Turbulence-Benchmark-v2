Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[531, -88, -266, -275, -217, 281, 283, -105, -209, -26, 91, 442, 252, 448, 312, 130, -240, 12, 341, 450, 5, 438]


The correct answer was:

[-240, 12, 341, 450]

But the LLM code returned:
[12, 341, 450]
