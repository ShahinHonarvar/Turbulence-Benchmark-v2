Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[143, 848, 766, 262, 500, 454, 655, 790, 102, 38, 837, 438, 764, 12, 450, 724, 236, 945, 902, 40, 35, 545, 939, 387, 224, 427, 38, 229, 443, 500, 240, 238, 226, 465, 296, 31, 839, 560, 645, 194, 992, 861, 129, 339, 724]


The correct answer was:

[29, 23, 7, 5, 3, 2]

But the LLM code returned:
[7, 5, 3, 2]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

(845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758, 622, 258, 910, 982, 812, 903, 317, 732, 899, 687, 477, 109, 439, 614, 913, 966, 482, 866, 267, 806, 553, 23, 722, 404, 826, 671, 11, 498, 868, 251, 331)
