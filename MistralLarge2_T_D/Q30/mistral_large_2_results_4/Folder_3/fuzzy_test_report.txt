Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['P3ae0HAmJ AS00q3Rdv0W0 Z00M00OxY00 D  dU0t0 0K0K ks0J0B7I0CXz 10cXdi6z0Hu7TQWin0l NCx7x XS0A80 Lf1l0IyO0C4C0N2wS3VOjc']


The correct answer was:

P3aeH0HAmJ ASH0H0q3RdvH0WH0 ZH0H0MH0H0OxYH0H0 D  dUH0tH0 H0KH0K ksH0JH0B7IH0CXz 1H0cXdi6zH0Hu7TQWinH0l NCx7x XSH0A8H0 Lf1lH0IyOH0C4CH0N2wS3VOjc

But the LLM code returned:
P3aeH0H0AmJ ASH0H0q3RdvH0WH0 ZH0H0MH0H0OxYH0H0 D  dUH0tH0 H0KH0K ksH0JH0B7IH0CXz 1H0cXdi6zH0H0u7TQWinH0l NCx7x XSH0A8H0 Lf1lH0IyOH0C4CH0N2wS3VOjc
