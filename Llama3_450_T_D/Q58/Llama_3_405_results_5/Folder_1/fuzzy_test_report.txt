Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[[ -9  -2   6   5   2  -1   5]
 [  1   8  -4   6  -6  -1  -6]
 [ -7   9  -2   7   9  -6  -1]
 [ -7  -8   0   5   7  -7   1]
 [  3   0   9  10  -4   7   5]
 [  4   6  -2  -9   7 -10  -8]
 [  2  10 -10   9   5   0  -3]]


The correct answer was:

0

But the LLM code returned:
13
