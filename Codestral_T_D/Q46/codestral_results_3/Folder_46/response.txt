The function will then calculate and return the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 78, 19, and 13 of the provided list.\n\nTo find the GCF, I will use the Euclidean algorithm, which is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(lst):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    num1 = lst[78]\n    num2 = lst[19]\n    num3 = lst[13]\n\n    return gcd(gcd(num1, num2), num3)\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
