To find the GCF, I'll use the Euclidean algorithm, which is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one until the two numbers are equal.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(numbers):\n    # Define a helper function to find the GCF of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm\n    def gcf(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    # Find the GCF of the numbers at indices 85, 36, and 54\n    return gcf(gcf(numbers[85], numbers[36]), numbers[54])\n```\n\nYou can test this function by calling it with a suitable list of numbers.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
