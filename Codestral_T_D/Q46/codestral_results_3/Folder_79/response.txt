The function uses the 'math.gcd' function to calculate the GCF, which is a built-in Python function. The GCF of the three numbers is calculated by finding the GCF of the numbers at indices 16 and 87, and then finding the GCF of that result and the number at index 95. The final result is returned by the function.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
