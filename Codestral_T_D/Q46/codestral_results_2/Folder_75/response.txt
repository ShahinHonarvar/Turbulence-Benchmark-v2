This function takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 70, 98, and 22.\n\nTo find the GCF of three numbers, I have used the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCF of two numbers is equal to the GCF of the second number and the remainder obtained by dividing the first number by the second number. This process is repeated until the remainder becomes zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF of the two numbers.\n\nHere is the Python code for the `gcf_three_nums` function:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    def gcf(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    return gcf(gcf(nums[70], nums[98]), nums[22])\n```', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
