It will return the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 20, 51, and 62 of the provided list.\n\nTo do this, I will use the math.gcd() function from the math module. This function computes the greatest common divisor of the two numbers passed to it. Since we need to find the greatest common factor of three numbers, I will first find the greatest common factor of the first two numbers (at indices 20 and 51), and then find the greatest common factor of the result and the third number (at index 62).\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(nums[20], nums[51]), nums[62])\n```\n\nThis function can be used as follows:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [i for i in range(1, 100)]  # A list of numbers from 1 to 99\nprint(gcf_three_nums(numbers))  # Prints the greatest common factor of numbers[20], numbers[51], and numbers[62]\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
