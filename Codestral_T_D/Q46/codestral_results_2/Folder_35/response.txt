This function will calculate and return the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 742, 888 and 629 in the provided list.\n\nTo calculate the GCF, I'll use the math.gcd() function from the math module, which computes the greatest common divisor of two integers. Since we need to find the GCF of three numbers, I'll first calculate the GCF of the number at index 742 and the number at index 888, then find the GCF of the result and the number at index 629.\n\nLet's implement this in Python code.\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    import math\n    gcf = math.gcd(nums[742], nums[888])\n    gcf = math.gcd(gcf, nums[629])\n    return gcf\n```\nThe function 'gcf_three_nums' has been successfully implemented. It takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 742, 888, and 629.\n\nNow you can use this function to find the greatest common factor of three elements in a list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
