Here's a Python function named 'gcf_three_nums' that takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 14, 21, and 17.\n\nI'll use the math.gcd function from Python's math module to calculate the GCF. This function takes two arguments and returns their GCF. To find the GCF of three numbers, I'll calculate the GCF of the first two numbers, then calculate the GCF of that result and the third number.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(num_list):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(num_list[14], num_list[21]), num_list[17])\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the input list has at least 22 elements. If that's not the case, this function will raise an IndexError. You may want to add error checking to handle such cases.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
