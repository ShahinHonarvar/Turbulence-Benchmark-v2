The function returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 695, 710, and 914 from the provided list. The GCF is calculated using the `math.gcd()` function, which returns the greatest common divisor of two integers. In order to find the GCF of three numbers, I calculate the GCF of the first two numbers and then find the GCF of the result and the third number. Here is the Python code for the `gcf_three_nums` function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    gcf = math.gcd(nums[695], nums[710])\n    gcf = math.gcd(gcf, nums[914])\n    return gcf\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of positive integers as an argument. The function will return the GCF of the elements at the specified indices.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
