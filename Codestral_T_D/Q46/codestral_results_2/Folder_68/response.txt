The function will then calculate the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 4, 1 and 7 of the input list.\n\nThe GCF of three numbers can be calculated by first finding the GCF of the first two numbers, and then finding the GCF of this result and the third number. To do this, I will use the `math.gcd` function from Python's `math` library.\n\nHere's the Python code for this function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(nums[4], nums[1]), nums[7])\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of positive integers as an argument. The function will return the GCF of the elements at indices 4, 1 and 7 of the input list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
