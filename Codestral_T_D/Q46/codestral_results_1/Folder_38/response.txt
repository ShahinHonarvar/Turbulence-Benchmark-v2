This function will then return the greatest common factor (gcf) of the elements at indices 14, 21, and 17 of the provided list.\n\nTo calculate the gcf, I'll use the `math.gcd` function which is available in Python's `math` module. This function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Since the gcf of three numbers is calculated as the gcf of the first two numbers and then the gcf of the result with the third number, I'll implement that logic using nested `math.gcd` calls.\n\nHere's the Python code that follows the above approach:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(numbers):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(numbers[14], numbers[21]), numbers[17])\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the input list `numbers` will always have at least 22 elements, as it attempts to access indices 14, 21, and 17. If this assumption is not true, the function may raise an `IndexError` exception.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
