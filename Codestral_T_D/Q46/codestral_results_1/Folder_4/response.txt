Then, I will use this 'gcf' function to find the GCF of the three numbers in the 'gcf_three_nums' function.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef gcf(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return gcf(gcf(nums[24], nums[25]), nums[80])\n```\n\nYou can call the 'gcf_three_nums' function with a list of positive integers as an argument to get the desired result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
