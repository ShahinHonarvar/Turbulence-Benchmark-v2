This function will then return the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 99, 95, and 80 from the input list. To calculate the GCF, I'll use the `math.gcd()` function from the Python `math` module, which finds the GCF of two numbers. Since we have three numbers, I'll find the GCF of the first two, then find the GCF of the third number and the result from the first step.\n\nLet me write the code for this.\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(nums[99], nums[95]), nums[80])\n```\nI have written the function `gcf_three_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument. This function calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 99, 95, and 80 from the input list and returns it.\n\nThe function is defined as follows:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(nums[99], nums[95]), nums[80])\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of positive integers to it.
