The function will then calculate and return the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements located at indices 9, 6, and 2 of the provided list. The GCF of three numbers can be calculated using the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCF of two numbers, and then repeating the process to find the GCF of the result and the third number.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    def gcf(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    return gcf(gcf(nums[9], nums[6]), nums[2])\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a list of positive integers as an argument, like this:\n\n```python\nprint(gcf_three_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
