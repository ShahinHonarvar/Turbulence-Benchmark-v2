This function will return the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 654, 312 and 441 of the provided list.\n\nTo calculate the GCF, I'll use the math.gcd function from the math module, which calculates the GCF of two numbers. I'll apply this function to the elements at the specified indices of the list.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this function.\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(nums[654], nums[312]), nums[441])\n```\nThe code has been successfully executed.
