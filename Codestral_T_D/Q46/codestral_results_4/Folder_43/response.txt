Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(lst):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(lst[33], lst[78]), lst[93])\n```\n\nThis function first imports the 'math' module, which provides the 'gcd' function for calculating the greatest common divisor. It then defines the 'gcf_three_nums' function, which takes a list 'lst' as an argument. It returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 33, 78, and 93 of the list.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input list 'lst' has at least 94 elements. If this is not the case, it will raise an 'IndexError'. You might want to add error handling to deal with this case.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
