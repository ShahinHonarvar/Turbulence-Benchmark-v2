This function will return the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 96, 53, and 35 from the provided list.\n\nHere's the Python code for this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(nums[96], nums[53]), nums[35])\n```\n\nThe 'gcf_three_nums' function first imports the 'math' module to use the 'gcd' function. Then, it calculates the GCF of the three numbers by calling the 'gcd' function three times: the first two calls calculate the GCF of the numbers at indices 96 and 53, and the final call calculates the GCF of the result of the first two calls and the number at index 35. The final result is then returned by the function.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
