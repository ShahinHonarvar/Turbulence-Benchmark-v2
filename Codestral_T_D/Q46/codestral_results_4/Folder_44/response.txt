Within the function, I'll calculate the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 62, 96, and 26 of the provided list. The GCF will be determined using the math.gcd() function, which computes the GCF of two numbers. To find the GCF of more than two numbers, I'll compute the GCF of the first two numbers, then compute the GCF of the result with the next number, and so on.\n\nHere's the Python code that fulfills the given specification:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(nums[62], nums[96]), nums[26])\n```\n\nThis function can be called with a list of positive integers to find the GCF of the specified elements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
