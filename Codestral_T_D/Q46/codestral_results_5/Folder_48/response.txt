Here's a simple function in Python that calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of three numbers from a list, given their indices. This function uses the math.gcd function from the Python math module to find the GCF.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(lst):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(lst[654], lst[312]), lst[441])\n```\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input list (lst) has at least 655 elements, as Python list indices start from 0. If the list might not have enough elements, you should add error handling to check for this.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
