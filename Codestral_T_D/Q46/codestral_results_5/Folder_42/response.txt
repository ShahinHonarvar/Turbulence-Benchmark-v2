The gcf is calculated using the math.gcd() function which calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(nums[19], nums[69]), nums[97])\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of positive integers as an argument. The function will return the gcf of the elements at indices 19, 69, and 97 of the list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
