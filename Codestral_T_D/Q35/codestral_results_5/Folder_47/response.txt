If a character is found to occur more than once in this range, it is added to a set of characters to remove. Finally, the function returns a new string where all occurrences of the characters in the 'chars_to_remove' set have been removed from the original string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
