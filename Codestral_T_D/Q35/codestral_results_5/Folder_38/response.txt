Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function takes a single argument, which is a string.\n2. It creates an empty string called `result` to store the altered string.\n3. It initializes an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the characters that have already been encountered.\n4. It iterates over the characters in the given string from index 36 to index 85 (exclusive).\n5. If a character is not already in the `seen` set and its count in the string is greater than 1, it is added to the `seen` set.\n6. If a character is not in the `seen` set, it is added to the `result` string.\n7. Finally, the function returns the altered `result` string.\n\nHere's the Python code for the `remove_repeat_chars` function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    result = ''\n    seen = set()\n    for char in s[36:85]:\n        if char not in seen and s.count(char) > 1:\n            seen.add(char)\n        if char not in seen:\n            result += char\n    return result\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
