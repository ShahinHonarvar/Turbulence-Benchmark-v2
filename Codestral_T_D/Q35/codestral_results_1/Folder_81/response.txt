Here it is:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    substring = s[20:201]\n    chars_to_remove = {char for char in substring if substring.count(char) > 1}\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the substring between indices 20 and 200 (exclusive). It then determines which characters occur more than once in this substring and stores them in a set. Finally, it generates a new string that consists of only the characters from the original string that are not in the set of characters to remove. The order of the characters is preserved in the new string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
