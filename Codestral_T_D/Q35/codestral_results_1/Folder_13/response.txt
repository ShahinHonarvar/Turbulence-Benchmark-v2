It then creates a set of characters that appear more than once in the substring. Finally, it constructs a new string that includes only the characters that do not appear in the set of repeated characters. The order of the characters is preserved because strings are ordered collections in Python. The function returns the altered string as the result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
