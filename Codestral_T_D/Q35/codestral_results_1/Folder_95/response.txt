It then creates a set 'repeat' of characters that occur more than once in the substring of s from index 32 to 99. Finally, it joins together all the characters in s that are not in 'repeat' and have not been seen before, preserving the order of the characters.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
