I will write a Python function called 'remove_repeat_chars' that will take a string as an argument. The function will iterate over the characters in the string between the indices 68 and 99 (exclusive), and if a character occurs more than once, it will remove all occurrences of that character from the string. Here's the Python code for this:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    char_count = {}\n    for i in range(68, 99):\n        if s[i] in char_count:\n            char_count[s[i]] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[s[i]] = 1\n\n    new_s = ''\n    for char in s:\n        if char_count.get(char, 0) <= 1:\n            new_s += char\n\n    return new_s\n```\n\nThis function first counts the occurrences of each character in the specified range. Then it builds a new string by only including characters that occur once or less.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
