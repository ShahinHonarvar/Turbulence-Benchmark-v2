I will then iterate through the characters of the string from index 77 to 84. If a character occurs more than once, I will remove all occurrences of that character from the string while preserving the order of all characters. Here is the Python code to do this.\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    count = {}\n    for i in range(77, 84):\n        if s[i] in count:\n            count[s[i]] += 1\n        else:\n            count[s[i]] = 1\n    for key in count:\n        if count[key] > 1:\n            s = s.replace(key, '')\n    return s\n```\n\nI will not execute this code as it's a function definition and I don't have any input to test it with.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
