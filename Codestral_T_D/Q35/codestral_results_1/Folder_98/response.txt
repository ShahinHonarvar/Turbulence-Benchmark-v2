Here\'s the Python function according to your specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(1, 7):\n        if s.count(s[i]) > 1:\n            chars_to_remove.add(s[i])\n    return \'\'.join(c for c in s if c not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the characters in the string from the second to the seventh index (since the problem specifies "between indices 0 and 7, *both exclusive*"). For each character, it checks whether it occurs more than once in the string. If it does, it adds the character to a set of characters to remove. Finally, it returns a new string that contains only the characters from the original string that are not in the set of characters to remove.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
