Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(1, 4):\n        if s.count(s[i]) > 1 and s[i] not in chars_to_remove:\n            chars_to_remove.add(s[i])\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThe function takes a string 's' as input. It initializes an empty set 'chars_to_remove' to store the characters that need to be removed. It then iterates over the characters in the string from index 1 to 4 (exclusive) and checks if the character occurs more than once in the string. If it does, the character is added to the 'chars_to_remove' set. Finally, the function returns a new string where all occurrences of the characters in the 'chars_to_remove' set have been removed, while preserving the order of the remaining characters.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
