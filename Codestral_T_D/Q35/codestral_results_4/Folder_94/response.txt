Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    to_remove = set(char for char in s[42:87] if s[42:87].count(char) > 1)\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a set of characters that appear more than once in the specified slice of the string. It then constructs a new string by iterating over each character in the original string and including it in the new string only if it's not in the set of characters to remove. The function returns the new string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
