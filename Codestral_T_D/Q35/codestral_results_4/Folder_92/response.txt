Here is the Python code to define a function named 'remove_repeat_chars' as per your requirements.\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    # Create a set to store characters between indices 0 and 2\n    chars_to_remove = set(s[i] for i in range(3) if s.count(s[i]) > 1)\n    # Use a list comprehension to remove repeated characters\n    return ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a set of characters that occur more than once between indices 0 and 2 in the input string. It then constructs a new string by iterating over the characters in the input string and including only those characters that are not in the set of characters to be removed. The order of characters is preserved in the output string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
