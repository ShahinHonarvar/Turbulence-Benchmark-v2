The function will remove all occurrences of a character from the string that occurs more than once between the indices 11 and 76 (exclusive), while preserving the order of all characters in the string. Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    count = {}\n    for i in range(11, 76):\n        char = string[i]\n        if char in count:\n            count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            count[char] = 1\n\n    result = ''\n    for char in string:\n        if count.get(char, 0) <= 1:\n            result += char\n\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can call the function with a string as an argument to remove the repeated characters between indices 11 and 76.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
