Here's the Python code that implements the function you described.\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    # create a dictionary to count character occurrences\n    count_dict = {}\n    for i in range(30, 200):\n        char = s[i]\n        if char in count_dict:\n            count_dict[char] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[char] = 1\n\n    # create a new string with repeated characters removed\n    new_s = ''\n    for char in s:\n        if count_dict.get(char, 0) <= 1:\n            new_s += char\n        else:\n            count_dict[char] = 0  # mark as removed\n\n    return new_s\n```\n\nThis function first counts the occurrences of each character in the string between indices 30 and 200. It then constructs a new string by copying over only the characters that occur once or less, while preserving the order of all characters.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
