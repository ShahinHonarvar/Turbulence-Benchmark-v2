Then, it counts the occurrences of each character in this middle section and identifies the characters that occur more than once. Finally, it constructs a new string by including only those characters that do not occur more than once in the middle section of the original string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
