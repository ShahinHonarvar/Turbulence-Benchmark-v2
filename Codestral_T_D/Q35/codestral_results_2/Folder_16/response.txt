Here's the Python code that implements the described function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    counter = {}\n    for i in range(90, 97):\n        char = s[i]\n        if char in counter:\n            counter[char] += 1\n        else:\n            counter[char] = 1\n\n    result = ''\n    for char in s:\n        if counter.get(char, 0) <= 1:\n            result += char\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function first loops through the characters at indices 90 to 97 (exclusive) and counts the occurrences of each character. Then it loops through the entire string and adds a character to the result only if it appears once or less in the specified range. Finally, it returns the resulting string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
