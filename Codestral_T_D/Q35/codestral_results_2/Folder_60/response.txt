Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(38, 52):\n        if s.count(s[i]) > 1:\n            chars_to_remove.add(s[i])\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a set to store the characters that occur more than once between the indices 38 and 52. It then iterates through the string (excluding the specified indices) and checks if each character appears more than once in the string. If it does, the character is added to the set of characters to remove. Finally, it returns a new string that consists of all the characters in the original string that are not in the set of characters to remove.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
