Here's the Python function 'remove_repeat_chars' that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(56, 90):\n        if s.count(s[i]) > 1:\n            chars_to_remove.add(s[i])\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function works by first initializing an empty set to store the characters that need to be removed. It then iterates over the string from index 56 to 89 (exclusive). If the count of a character in this range is greater than 1, it is added to the set of characters to remove. Finally, the function returns a new string that contains only the characters that are not in the set of characters to remove.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
