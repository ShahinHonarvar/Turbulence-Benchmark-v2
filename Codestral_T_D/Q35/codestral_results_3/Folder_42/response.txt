Here's the Python code to define the function 'remove_repeat_chars' as per your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    # Create a set to store characters that occur more than once in the specified range\n    to_remove = set(char for char in s[18:60] if s[18:60].count(char) > 1)\n\n    # Remove all occurrences of these characters from the string\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a set of characters that appear more than once in the specified range of the string. It then constructs a new string by iterating over each character in the original string and including it in the new string only if it's not in the set of characters to remove.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
