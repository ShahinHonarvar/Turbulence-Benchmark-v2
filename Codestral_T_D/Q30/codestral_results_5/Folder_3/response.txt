This function takes a string as input and returns a modified string where the character 'H' is inserted immediately before any occurrence of the character '0'. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function defines a lambda function that checks if the current character is '0' and replaces it with 'H0'.\n2. The map function applies this lambda function to each character in the input string, resulting in a new string with 'H' inserted before '0'.\n3. The join function is used to concatenate the characters back into a single string.\n\nYou can use this function to modify your strings as needed.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
