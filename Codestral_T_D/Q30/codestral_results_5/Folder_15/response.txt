Define the function 'insert_before_character'.\n2. Use the 'replace' string method to insert 'o' before each 'o' in the input string.\n3. Return the modified string.\n\nLet's write the Python code for it.\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(s):\n    return s.replace('o', 'oo')\n```\nI have defined the function 'insert_before_character' as per your requirement. This function takes a string as an argument and returns a modified string where the character 'o' is inserted immediately before each 'o' in the original string.\n\nYou can now use this function to modify strings as needed. Would you like to test this function with some specific inputs?", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
