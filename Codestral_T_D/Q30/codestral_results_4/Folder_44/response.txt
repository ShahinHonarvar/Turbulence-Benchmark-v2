This function will return a new string that is identical to the input string, except that the character 'M' is inserted immediately before any occurrences of the character 'g'. Here's how the function works:\n\n- It initializes an empty list to store the characters of the new string.\n- It iterates through each character in the input string.\n- If the current character is 'g', it appends 'M' and then 'g' to the list.\n- If the current character is not 'g', it just appends the current character to the list.\n- Finally, it joins all the characters in the list into a single string and returns it.\n\nNow you can use this function to insert 'M' before any 'g' in a given string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
