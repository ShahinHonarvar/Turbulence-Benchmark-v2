This function takes a string as input and returns a new string where an additional 'o' is inserted immediately before any occurrences of the character 'o' in the original string. Here's how it works:\n\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(s):\n    return s.replace('o', 'oo')\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a string as an argument, like so: `insert_before_character('hello')`. This will return the string 'hellooello', as there are two 'o' characters in 'hello', and the function inserts an additional 'o' before each occurrence.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
