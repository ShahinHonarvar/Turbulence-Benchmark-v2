This function returns a new string that is identical to the input string, except that the character 'u' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of the character 'X'. Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(s):\n    return s.replace('X', 'uX')\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a string as the argument. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(insert_before_character('This is a test with X and Xs'))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThis is a test with uX and uXs\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
