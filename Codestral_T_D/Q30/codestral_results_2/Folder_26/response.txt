The function will iterate through each character in the string and if it finds a 'r', it will insert a 'w' before it. Finally, it will return the modified string.\n\nNow, let me code this for you.\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(s):\n    return 'w'.join(s.split('r'))\n```\nI have created the function 'insert_before_character' that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the character 'w' inserted before any occurrence of the character 'r'. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function uses the 'split' method to split the input string into a list of substrings. The split is done at every 'r' character, so the list will contain the parts of the string that are not 'r'.\n2. Then, the function uses the 'join' method to join the substrings back into a single string, but this time it inserts 'w' between each substring.\n\nNow, you can test the function with different inputs.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
