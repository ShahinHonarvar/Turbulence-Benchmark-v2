Here is the Python code for this:\n\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(s):\n    return 'Q'.join(s.split('O'))\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string at every occurrence of 'O' and then joining the resulting substrings with 'Q' in between. This effectively inserts 'Q' before every 'O' in the string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
