The function returns a set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 90 and index 200, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function returns an empty set.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with two lists as arguments. For example:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]\nlist2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...]\nresult = identical_elements(list1, list2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output the set of identical elements that meet the given conditions.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
