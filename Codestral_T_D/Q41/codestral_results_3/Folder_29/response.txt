This function takes two lists as arguments and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists between indices 59 and 97 (both inclusive). If no such elements exist, the function returns an empty set.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    set1 = set(list1[59:98])\n    set2 = set(list2[59:98])\n    return set1.intersection(set2)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with two lists as arguments. Make sure the lists are of the same size and have at least 98 elements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
