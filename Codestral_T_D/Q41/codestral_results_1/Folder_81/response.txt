The function will iterate through the elements in both lists from index 10 to index 100 (both inclusive) and check if an element occurs in both lists. If an element is found in both lists, it will be added to a set. Finally, the function will return this set. If no common elements are found, an empty set will be returned.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Extract elements from index 10 to 100 (both inclusive)\n    sublist1 = set(list1[10:101])\n    sublist2 = set(list2[10:101])\n    # Return the intersection of the two sets\n    return sublist1 & sublist2\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
