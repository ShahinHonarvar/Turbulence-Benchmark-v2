Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i in range(74, 96):\n        if i < len(nums):\n            num = nums[i]\n            if num > 1:\n                for j in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n                    if num % j == 0:\n                        composite_nums.add(num)\n                        break\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nThe function takes a list of positive integers as input. It iterates over the range from index 74 to 95 (both inclusive) and checks if each number in that range is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. If a composite number is found, it is added to a set called `composite_nums`. Finally, the function returns the set of composite numbers found in the specified range. If no composite numbers are found, an empty set is returned.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
