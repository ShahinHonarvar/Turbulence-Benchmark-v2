Here is the Python function that meets your specifications:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i in range(42, 69):\n        if nums[i] > 1:\n            for j in range(2, nums[i]):\n                if (nums[i] % j) == 0:\n                    composite_nums.add(nums[i])\n                    break\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nThis function goes through all the numbers in the given list starting from index 42 to index 68. For each number, it checks if it's a composite number by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to the number itself - 1. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it's a composite number and it's added to the set of composite numbers. The function then returns this set. If no composite numbers are found in the specified range, it returns an empty set.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
