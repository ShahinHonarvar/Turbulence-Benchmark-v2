This function will return a set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 12 to index 92, inclusive.\n\nTo check if a number is composite, I will use the fact that a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than one or itself. I will iterate over the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and check if any of them divide the number evenly. If one is found, the number is composite.\n\nHere is the Python code for this:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i in range(12, 93):\n        num = nums[i]\n        for j in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n            if num % j == 0:\n                composite_nums.add(num)\n                break\n    return composite_nums\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
