This function will iterate through the elements in the list from index 62 to index 78 (both inclusive). For each number in this range, it will check if it is composite. If a composite number is found, it will be added to a set. Finally, the function will return this set of composite numbers. If no composite numbers are found in the specified range, an empty set will be returned.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for num in nums[62:79]:\n        if num > 1:\n            for i in range(2, num):\n                if (num % i) == 0:\n                    composite_nums.add(num)\n                    break\n    return composite_nums\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
