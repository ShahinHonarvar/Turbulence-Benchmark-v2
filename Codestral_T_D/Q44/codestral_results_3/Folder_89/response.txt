This function identifies the composite numbers in the list that are located between index 36 to index 46, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, an empty set is returned.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i in range(36, 47):\n        if nums[i] > 1:\n            for j in range(2, nums[i]):\n                if nums[i] % j == 0:\n                    composite_nums.add(nums[i])\n                    break\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of positive integers as an argument to it. It will return the set of composite numbers that are within the specified index range.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
