The function will then iterate over the numbers in the list at indices 1 to 1 (since the range is inclusive and the start and end are the same). For each number, it will check if the number is composite (a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself). If the number is composite, it will be added to a set. Finally, the function will return this set of composite numbers. If no composite number is found in the specified range, the function will return an empty set. Let's write this code.\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(lst):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i in range(1, 2):\n        num = lst[i]\n        if any(num % i == 0 for i in range(2, num)):\n            composite_nums.add(num)\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nThis function works for the case of a list with at least 2 elements. If the list might have less than 2 elements, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to return an empty set if the list has less than 2 elements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
