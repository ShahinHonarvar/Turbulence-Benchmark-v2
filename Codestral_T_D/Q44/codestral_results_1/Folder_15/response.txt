This function will return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 0 to index 3, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function will return an empty set.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for num in nums[0:4]:\n        if num > 1:\n            for i in range(2, num):\n                if (num % i) == 0:\n                    composite_nums.add(num)\n                    break\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of positive integers as an argument, and it will return the set of composite numbers that are between index 0 to index 3 in the list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
