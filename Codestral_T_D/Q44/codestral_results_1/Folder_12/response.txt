This function takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns a set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 51 to index 86, both inclusive. It checks each number in the specified range to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself, and if so, it is considered a composite number and added to the set. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function will return an empty set.\n\nYou can now use this function by passing a list of positive integers as an argument.
