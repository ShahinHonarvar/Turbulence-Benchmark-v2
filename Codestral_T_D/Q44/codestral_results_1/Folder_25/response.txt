This function will iterate over the list from index 75 to index 94, both inclusive. It will check if a number is composite or not: a number is composite if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If the number is composite, it will be added to a set. Finally, the function will return the set of all composite numbers in the specified range.\n\nLet's write the Python code now.\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i in range(75, 95):\n        num = nums[i]\n        for j in range(2, num):\n            if (num % j) == 0:\n                composite_nums.add(num)\n                break\n    return composite_nums\n```\nI've written the `composite_nums_between_indices` function. This function takes a list of positive integers as input. It then checks each number in the list from index 75 to 94 (inclusive) to see if it's a composite number. If a number is composite, it's added to a set. The function finally returns this set of composite numbers.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
