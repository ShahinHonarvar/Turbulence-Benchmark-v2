For each number, it checks if it is greater than 1 (as 1 is not considered a composite number). Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any integer in the range from 2 to the square root of the number (as a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked). If the number is divisible by any such integer, it is added to the set of composite numbers and the loop is broken. Finally, the function returns the set of composite numbers.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
