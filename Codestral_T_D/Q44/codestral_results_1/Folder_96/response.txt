This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns a set of composite numbers that are present between the indices 60 and 200 (both inclusive). If no composite numbers exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty set.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(numbers):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for num in numbers[60:201]:\n        for i in range(2, num):\n            if (num % i) == 0:\n                composite_nums.add(num)\n                break\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of positive integers as an argument. The function will return a set of composite numbers that are between indices 60 and 200 in the given list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
