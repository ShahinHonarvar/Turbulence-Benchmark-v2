The function takes a list of positive integers as an argument, and it returns a set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 32 to index 35, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty set.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i in range(32, 36):\n        num = nums[i]\n        if num > 1:\n            for j in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n                if num % j == 0:\n                    composite_nums.add(num)\n                    break\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of positive integers as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]\ncomposite_numbers = composite_nums_between_indices(numbers)\nprint(composite_numbers)\n```\n\nThis will output: `{33, 35, 36}`', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
