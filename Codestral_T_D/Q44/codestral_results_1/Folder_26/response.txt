The function will create a set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between indices 22 to 50, inclusive. If no composite numbers are found in the specified range, the function will return an empty set.\n\nComposite numbers are those that have more than two distinct positive divisors. To find composite numbers, I will check each number in the specified range if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If it does, I will add the number to the set.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i in range(22, 51):\n        num = nums[i]\n        for j in range(2, num):\n            if num % j == 0:\n                composite_nums.add(num)\n                break\n    return composite_nums\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
