Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i in range(28, 33):\n        if i < len(nums) and nums[i] > 1:\n            for j in range(2, int(nums[i]**0.5) + 1):\n                if nums[i] % j == 0:\n                    composite_nums.add(nums[i])\n                    break\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of positive integers as an argument. It initializes an empty set to store the composite numbers. It then iterates through the specified range of indices (from 28 to 32, both inclusive). For each index, it checks if the number at that index is greater than 1. If so, it checks for divisors from 2 to the square root of the number. If a divisor is found, the number is considered composite, and it is added to the set. Finally, the function returns the set of composite numbers. If no composite number exists in the specified range, an empty set will be returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
