Here, I'll implement a function called `all_substring_of_size_n` to solve this problem. This function will iterate through the string, and for each character, it will check all substrings of length 146 starting from that character. If a substring with no duplicate characters is found, it will be added to the result list.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    n = 146\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(s) - n + 1):\n        substring = s[i:i+n]\n        if len(set(substring)) == n:\n            result.append(substring)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating an empty list `result` to hold the final substrings. It then iterates over every possible starting position for a substring of length `n` in the input string `s`. For each starting position, it extracts the substring and checks if it contains no duplicate characters by comparing the length of the set of its characters to `n`. If they are equal, the substring is added to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains all distinct substrings of length `n` with no duplicate characters found in the input string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
