It then checks if all characters in the substring are unique by converting the substring to a set (which removes duplicates) and comparing its length to `n`. If the lengths are equal, it means that all characters in the substring are unique, and the substring is added to the `subs` list. Finally, the function returns the `subs` list.\n\nPlease note that it is highly unlikely to find a substring of length 114 with no duplicate characters in a regular text, as it would require a text of at least 114 unique characters.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
