If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of integers as an argument. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\nresult = sum_even_ints_inclusive(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output the sum of even integers from index 14 to index 64 in the 'numbers' list. If no even integers exist in that range, it will output 0.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
