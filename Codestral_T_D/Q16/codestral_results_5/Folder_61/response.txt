It then checks if each number is even by checking if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0. If a number is even, it is added to the sum. The sum is then returned by the function. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0, as the sum of an empty list is 0.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
