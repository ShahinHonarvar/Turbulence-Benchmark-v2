This function should return the sum of all even integers from index 64 to index 66, inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(int_list):\n    return sum(i for i in int_list[64:67] if i % 2 == 0)\n```\n\nThis function uses list slicing to extract the relevant portion of the list (from index 64 to 66, inclusive) and then uses a generator expression to filter out the even numbers. The sum of these even numbers is then returned by the function. If no even numbers exist in the specified range, the sum will be 0.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
