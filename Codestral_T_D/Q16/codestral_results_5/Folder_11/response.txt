Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(int_list):\n    return sum(x for x in int_list[37:52] if x % 2 == 0)\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the list from index 37 to 52 (the end index in Python's slicing is exclusive, so we need to use 52 to include index 51), checks if the number is even (by checking if the remainder of the division by 2 is 0), and if it is, it adds it to the sum. If no even numbers are found in the specified range, the sum will be 0.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
