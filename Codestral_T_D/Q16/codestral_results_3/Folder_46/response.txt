This function will iterate over the list from index 30 to index 87 (inclusive) and sum up all the even numbers in this range. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nLet's implement this.\n```python\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return sum(i for i in lst[30:88] if i % 2 == 0)\n```\nThe function 'sum_even_ints_inclusive' has been successfully defined. It takes a list of integers as an input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 30 to index 87, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nPlease note that Python list indexing is 0-based, which means the first element is at index 0. So, to include the number at index 87, we need to specify index 88 in the list slicing.\n\nYou can now use this function to calculate the sum of even numbers in a specified range of a list of integers.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
