This function takes a positive integer as its argument and returns a list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 6 and 8, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = find_divisors_in_range(12)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```python\n[6]\n```\n\nSince 6 is the only divisor of 12 that is between 6 and 8, both inclusive.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
