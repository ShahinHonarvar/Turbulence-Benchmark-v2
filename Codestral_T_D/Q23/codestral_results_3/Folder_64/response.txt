This function takes a positive integer as its argument and returns a list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list. Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(1, 10) if n % i == 0]\n    return divisors\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(find_divisors_in_range(12))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```python\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]\n```\n\nSince 12 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, and all these divisors are between 1 and 9 (inclusive), they are returned in the list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
