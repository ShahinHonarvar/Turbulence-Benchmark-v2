This function will find all the positive divisors of the given integer that are within the range of 15 to 92, inclusive. If no divisors are found in this range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    return [i for i in range(15, 93) if n % i == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of all numbers in the range from 15 to 93 that are divisors of 'n'. The '%' operator is used to check if 'n' is divisible by the current number 'i'. If 'n' is divisible by 'i', then 'i' is added to the list. If no such numbers are found, an empty list is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
