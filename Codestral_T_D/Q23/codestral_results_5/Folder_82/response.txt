This function returns a list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 4 and 6, inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(4, 7) if n % i == 0]\n    return divisors\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(find_divisors_in_range(12))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```python\n[4, 6]\n```\n\nSince 12 is divisible by 4 and 6, and both 4 and 6 are within the specified range of 4 to 6, they are included in the returned list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
