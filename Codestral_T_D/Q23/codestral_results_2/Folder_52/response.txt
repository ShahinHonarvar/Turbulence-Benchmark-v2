This function takes a positive integer as its argument, and it returns a list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 70 and 72, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(70, 73) if n % i == 0]\n    return divisors\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = find_divisors_in_range(140)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output: `[70]`, which is the list of all positive divisors of 140 that are between 70 and 72, both inclusive.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
