This function will take a positive integer as an argument and return a list of all its positive divisors that are within the range of 35 to 98, inclusive. If there are no divisors in this range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's how I am going to implement this:\n1. Define the function 'find_divisors_in_range' that accepts a single argument 'n'.\n2. Initialize an empty list 'divisors' to store the divisors of 'n' that lie in the required range.\n3. Iterate over the range from 35 to 98 (both inclusive).\n4. For each number in the range, check if it is a divisor of 'n'. If it is, append it to the 'divisors' list.\n5. Finally, return the 'divisors' list.\n\nLet's implement this now.\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(35, 99) if n % i == 0]\n    return divisors\n```\nThe Python function 'find_divisors_in_range' has been successfully defined.
