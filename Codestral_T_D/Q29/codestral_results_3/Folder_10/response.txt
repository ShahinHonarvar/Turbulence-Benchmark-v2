Here's the Python code that defines a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 15 and 99 in the list.\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(num_list):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    return gcd(num_list[15], num_list[99])\n```\n\nThis code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd), which is also the greatest common factor (gcf) for two positive integers. The gcd function is defined within the 'gcf_two_nums' function, which then uses this helper function to find the gcf of the numbers at the specified indices.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
