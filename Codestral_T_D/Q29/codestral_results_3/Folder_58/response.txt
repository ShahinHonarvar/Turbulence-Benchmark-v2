Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for. This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common factor (gcf) of two numbers.\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(lst):\n    num1 = lst[129]\n    num2 = lst[582]\n    while(num2):\n        num1, num2 = num2, num1 % num2\n    return num1\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of positive integers as input. It then extracts the integers at indices 129 and 582. The Euclidean algorithm is used to find the greatest common factor of these two numbers, which is then returned by the function.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
