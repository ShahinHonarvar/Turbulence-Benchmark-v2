Here's a simple Python function that uses the math.gcd function from the math module to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers. The function takes a list of integers as input and returns the GCF of the integers at indices 48 and 74.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_two_nums(num_list):\n    return math.gcd(num_list[48], num_list[74])\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the input list has at least 75 elements, as it attempts to access the 75th element (which is at index 74, since Python uses 0-based indexing). If this is not the case, the function will raise an IndexError. You might want to add some error handling to deal with this case, depending on your specific needs.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
