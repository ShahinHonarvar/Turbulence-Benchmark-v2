Here is a Python function that takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of the integers at indices 47 and 97.\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    return gcd(nums[47], nums[97])\n```\n\nThis function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is the same as the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers. The `gcd` function is defined inside the `gcf_two_nums` function to help with the calculation.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
