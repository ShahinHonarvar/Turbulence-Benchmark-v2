Here's a simple Python function that calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while(b):\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    return gcd(nums[48], nums[76])\n```\n\nThis function works by continuously replacing `a` with the remainder of `a / b` until `b` is zero. At that point, `a` is the GCF of the original `a` and `b`. The function `gcd` is defined inside `gcf_two_nums` to calculate the GCF of two numbers. The main function `gcf_two_nums` then uses `gcd` to find the GCF of the numbers at indices 48 and 76 of the input list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
