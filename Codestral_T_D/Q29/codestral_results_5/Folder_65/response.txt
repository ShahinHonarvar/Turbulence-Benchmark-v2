This function takes as an argument a list of positive integers and returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of the integers at indices 29 and 53 of that list.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a list of positive integers as its argument. For example:\n\n```python\nnums = [....]  # your list of positive integers\nresult = gcf_two_nums(nums)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nJust ensure to replace `[....]` with your actual list of integers. The function will then print the GCF of the integers at indices 29 and 53.\n\nThis function uses the `math.gcd` function from the Python `math` module to calculate the GCF. It follows a standard approach of repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one until the two numbers are equal. The GCF is then this final equal number. The function handles the case where the indices 29 or 53 are out of the range of the list by raising a `ValueError`.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
