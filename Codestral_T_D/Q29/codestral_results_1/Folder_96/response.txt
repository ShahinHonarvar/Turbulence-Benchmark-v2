The function will then return the greatest common factor (gcd) of the integers at indices 95 and 73 in the provided list.\n\nThe gcd is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, which is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. This algorithm is based on the property that the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    return gcd(nums[95], nums[73])\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
