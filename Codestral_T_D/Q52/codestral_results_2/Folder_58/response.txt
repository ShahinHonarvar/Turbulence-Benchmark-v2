Let's create a function called 'palindrome_of_length_n' which will take a string as input and return a set of all English letter palindromes of length 223 that are substrings of the input string. The function will ignore case during its operations. If no such palindromes are found, an empty set will be returned.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(s):\n    s = s.lower()\n    n = 223\n    return {s[i:i+n] for i in range(len(s) - n + 1) if s[i:i+n] == s[i:i+n][::-1] and s[i:i+n].isalpha()}\n```\n\nThe function first converts the input string to lowercase. It then uses a set comprehension to generate all possible substrings of length 'n' from the string. It checks if each substring is equal to its reverse (which indicates that it's a palindrome) and if it consists only of English letters. The set of all such palindromes is then returned by the function.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
