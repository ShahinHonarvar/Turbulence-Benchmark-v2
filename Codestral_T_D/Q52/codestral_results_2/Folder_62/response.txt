Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function takes one argument, a string, as input.\n2. It initializes an empty set to store the palindromes of length 188 found in the given string.\n3. It iterates through the input string, considering all possible substrings of length 188.\n4. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.\n5. If the substring is a palindrome and it only consists of English letters, it is added to the set of palindromes.\n6. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nYou can now use the 'palindrome_of_length_n' function to find all palindromes of length 188 in a given string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
