Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(s):\n    n = 48\n    s = s.lower()\n    return {s[i:i+n] for i in range(len(s)-n+1) if s[i:i+n] == s[i:i+n][::-1] and s[i:i+n].isalpha()}\n```\n\nThis function first converts the input string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity. It then uses a set comprehension to generate all possible substrings of length 48 from the string. For each substring, it checks if the substring is equal to its reverse (which would indicate that it's a palindrome) and if it only consists of English letters. If both conditions are true, the substring is added to the set. Finally, the function returns the set of all palindromes found.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
