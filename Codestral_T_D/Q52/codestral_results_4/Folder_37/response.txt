It then checks if the substring is equal to its reverse (which would mean it's a palindrome) and if it only contains English letters. If both conditions are met, the substring is added to a set. The function finally returns this set.\n\nNote: This function is case-insensitive, so it converts the string to lowercase before doing any calculations.\n\nAlso note: This function returns a set of all palindromes of length 84 in the string. If you want to find just one palindrome, you can modify the function to return the first one it finds, or to return `None` if it doesn't find any.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
