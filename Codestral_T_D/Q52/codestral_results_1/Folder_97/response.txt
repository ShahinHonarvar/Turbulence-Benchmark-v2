This function will take a string as its argument and return a set of all palindromes of length 210 that are substrings of the given string. The function will be case-insensitive and will only consider English letters in the palindromes.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(s):\n    s = s.lower()\n    length = 210\n    return {s[i:i+length] for i in range(len(s) - length + 1) if s[i:i+length] == s[i:i+length][::-1] and s[i:i+length].isalpha()}\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the input string to lowercase. Then it uses a set comprehension to generate all possible substrings of the specified length and checks if they are equal to their reverse (indicating that they are palindromes) and if they consist only of English letters. If all these conditions are met, the substring is added to the set. The function finally returns this set of palindromes.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
