Here's a Python function that should meet your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(s):\n    return {s[i:i+7] for i in range(len(s)-6) if s[i:i+7].lower() == s[i:i+7].lower()[::-1] and s[i:i+7].isalpha()}\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `s` as input. It uses a set comprehension to generate all substrings of length 7 in the string. For each substring, it checks if the lowercase version of the substring is equal to its reverse (which would indicate that it's a palindrome), and if it's composed only of English letters. If both conditions are true, the substring is added to the set. Finally, the function returns the set of all such palindromes.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
