This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a set of all palindromes of length 27 that are substrings of the given string. The function is case-insensitive, which means it will treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent.\n\nThe function works by iterating over the string and checking each substring of length 27 to see if it is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards as forwards. This is checked by comparing the substring with its reverse. If the substring is a palindrome, it is added to a set. If no palindromes of the specified length are found, the function returns an empty set.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
