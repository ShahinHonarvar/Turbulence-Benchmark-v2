Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(s):\n    n = 131\n    s = s.lower()\n    return {s[i:i+n] for i in range(len(s) - n + 1) if s[i:i+n] == s[i:i+n][::-1] and s[i:i+n].isalpha()}\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `s` as input, and it first converts `s` to lowercase. It then uses a set comprehension to generate all substrings of `s` of length `n` (which is set to 131). For each substring, it checks if the substring is equal to its reverse (which would mean it's a palindrome) and if it consists only of English letters. If both conditions are true, the substring is added to the set. Finally, the function returns the set of all palindromes.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
