It then initializes the length of the palindromes to be found. It uses a set comprehension to generate all substrings of length `n` from the string. For each substring, it checks if the substring is equal to its reverse (which is the definition of a palindrome), and if it consists only of English letters. If both conditions are met, the substring is added to the set. Finally, the set of all such palindromes is returned.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
