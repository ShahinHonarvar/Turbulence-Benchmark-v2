Here's a Python function that should meet your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(s):\n    n = 80\n    s = s.lower()\n    return {s[i:i+n] for i in range(len(s)-n+1) if s[i:i+n] == s[i:i+n][::-1] and s[i:i+n].isalpha()}\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the input string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity. It then uses a set comprehension to generate all possible substrings of length `n` from the input string. For each substring, it checks if it's equal to its reverse (which is a characteristic of palindromes) and if it consists only of English letters. If both conditions are true, the substring is added to the set. Finally, the function returns the set of all palindromes found.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
