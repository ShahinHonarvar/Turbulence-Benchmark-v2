This results in a new list that is one element longer than the original list.\n\nIt's important to note that Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 0. Also, if the index provided exceeds the size of the list, Python will throw an IndexError. To ensure this doesn't happen, I will add a check to ensure the index is within the bounds of the list.\n\nHere is the Python function that meets these specifications:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    if len(lst) > 564:\n        lst.insert(564, 149)\n    return lst\n```\n\nThis function checks if the length of the input list is greater than 564. If it is, it inserts 149 at index 564. Finally, it returns the modified list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
