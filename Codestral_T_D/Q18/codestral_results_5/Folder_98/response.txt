The sum of these numbers is then returned. Note that any integer is divisible by -1, so the condition `i % -1 == 0` is always true. Therefore, the function could be simplified to only check for divisibility by 13:\n\n```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(lst):\n    return sum([i for i in lst[0:6] if i % 13 == 0])\n```', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
