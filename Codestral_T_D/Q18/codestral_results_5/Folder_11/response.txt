The function will iterate over the elements from index 22 to index 24 (since the indices are inclusive, the last index is 24) and check if each element is divisible by either -85 or -30. If it is, the element will be added to a running total. The function will return this total. If no elements are divisible by either -85 or -30 within the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nLet's write this function in Python.\n```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(lst):\n    return sum(i for i in lst[22:25] if i % -85 == 0 or i % -30 == 0)\n```\nThe function 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' has been successfully defined.
