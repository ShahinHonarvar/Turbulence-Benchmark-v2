This function should sum up all the integers in the list from index 1 to 8 (both inclusive) that are divisible by either -9 or -3. If no such integers are found in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere is the Python code to do that:\n\n```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(lst):\n    return sum(num for num in lst[1:9] if num % -9 == 0 or num % -3 == 0)\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements in the list from index 1 to 8, and checks if the number is divisible by -9 or -3. If it is, the number is included in the sum. If no such integers are found, the sum will be 0.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
