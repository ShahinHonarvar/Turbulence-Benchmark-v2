A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, excluding the number itself. I'll write a function that checks if the integer at index 8 of a given list is a perfect number. Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(numbers):\n    num = numbers[8]\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, num):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum == num\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the numbers from 1 to the number at index 8 of the input list and adding up the numbers that divide it evenly. If the sum of these divisors is equal to the number itself, then it is a perfect number and the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
