Here's a simple Python function that does what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(num_list):\n    num = num_list[73]\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, num):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum == num\n```\n\nThis function checks if the number at index 73 in the given list is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. The function iterates through all integers from 1 to the given number, checks if each integer is a divisor of the number, and if so, adds it to the sum. Finally, the function returns True if the sum is equal to the number (indicating that the number is a perfect number), and False otherwise.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
