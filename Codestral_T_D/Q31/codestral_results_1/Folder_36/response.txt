Here's a Python function that does what you've asked:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(num_list):\n    def is_perfect(n):\n        sum = 1\n        i = 2\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i:\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                if i * (n // i) == n:\n                    sum = sum + i + n//i\n                i += 1\n        return sum == n and n!=1\n    return is_perfect(num_list[990])\n```\n\nThis function `if_perfect_num` takes a list of positive integers as an argument. It then checks if the integer at index 990 in this list is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. The function `is_perfect` is a helper function that checks if a number is perfect by summing up its divisors. If the sum of the divisors is equal to the number and the number is not 1, then it is a perfect number. The function `if_perfect_num` returns `True` if the number at index 990 is a perfect number, and `False` otherwise.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
