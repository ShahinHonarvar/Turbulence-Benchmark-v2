Here's a simple Python function that should do the job:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(num_list):\n    num = num_list[714]\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, num):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum == num\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the number at index 714 of the provided list is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. The function iterates over all numbers from 1 to the given number, and if a number is a divisor of the given number, it's added to the sum. Finally, the function checks if the sum is equal to the number, and returns True if it is, and False otherwise.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
