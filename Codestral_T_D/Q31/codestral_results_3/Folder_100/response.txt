A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. The function iterates over all numbers from 1 to the number-1 and checks if the number is divisible by the current number. If it is, the current number is added to the sum. Finally, the function returns True if the sum is equal to the number, indicating that it is a perfect number, and False otherwise.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
