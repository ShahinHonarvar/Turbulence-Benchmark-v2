Here's a simple Python function that should do the trick:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(num_list):\n    num = num_list[92]\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, num):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum == num\n```\n\nThis function checks if the number at index 92 in the provided list is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to the target number, checking if each number is a divisor of the target number. If a number is a divisor, it is added to the sum. Finally, the function checks if the sum is equal to the target number and returns True if they are equal, and False otherwise.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
