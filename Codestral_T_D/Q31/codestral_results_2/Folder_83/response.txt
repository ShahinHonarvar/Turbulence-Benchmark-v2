A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. The function iterates through all the divisors of the number up to its square root, and if a divisor is found, it is added to the sum. If the sum is equal to the number, then the number is a perfect number. If the number is 1, it is not considered as a perfect number.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
