Here's a simple Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(num_list):\n    num = num_list[77]\n    sum = 1\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            if i == (num / i):\n                sum = sum + i\n            else:\n                sum = sum + (i + num//i)\n    return sum == num and num != 1\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the number at index 77 in the provided list is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. The function iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if the number is divisible by the current iteration. If it is, it adds the divisor and the quotient to the sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the number and if the number is not 1 (since 1 is not considered a perfect number). If both conditions are true, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
