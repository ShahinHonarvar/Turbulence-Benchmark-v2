The function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as an argument. It calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the tuple between indices 44 and 91. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation does not have the prefix '0b', and the hexadecimal representation does not have the prefix '0x'. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
