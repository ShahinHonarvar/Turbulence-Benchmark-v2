This function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as input. It calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 20 and 51.\n\nIf the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum without the '0b' prefix. If the sum is an even number, the function returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum without the '0x' prefix. The binary and hexadecimal representations will start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in the hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n\nIf all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function will return an empty string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
