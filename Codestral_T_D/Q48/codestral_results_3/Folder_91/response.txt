It then calculates the set of missing numbers between 'a + 1' and 'b - 1' (both inclusive) that are not in the tuple. The sum of these missing numbers is calculated. If the sum is zero, an empty string is returned. If the sum is odd, the binary representation of the sum is returned. If the sum is even, the hexadecimal representation of the sum is returned. The binary and hexadecimal representations are returned without the '0b' or '0x' prefix.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
