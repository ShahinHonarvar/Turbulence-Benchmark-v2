The function calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 32 and 99. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string. The binary representation does not have the '0b' prefix, and the hexadecimal representation does not have the '0x' prefix. The binary and hexadecimal representations start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in the hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
