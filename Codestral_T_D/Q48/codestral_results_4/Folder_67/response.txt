We then create a set of all missing numbers between 'a' and 'b' that are not present in the tuple between indices 44 and 67. The sum of these missing numbers is calculated. If the sum is odd, the binary representation (without the '0b' prefix) is returned. If the sum is even, the hexadecimal representation (without the '0x' prefix) is returned. If there are no missing numbers, an empty string is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
