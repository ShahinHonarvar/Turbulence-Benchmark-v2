The function will calculate the sum of all integers from 'a + 1' to 'b - 1' (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 6 and 7. If the sum is an odd number, the function will return the binary representation string of the sum. Otherwise, it will return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. If all integers from 'a + 1' to 'b - 1' are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function will return an empty string.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(nums):\n    a = nums[6]\n    b = nums[7]\n    missing_nums = [num for num in range(a + 1, b) if num not in nums[6:8]]\n    total = sum(missing_nums)\n    if total % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(total)[2:]\n    elif total != 0:\n        return hex(total)[2:]\n    else:\n        return ''\n```\n\nYou can call the function by passing a tuple of nonnegative integers as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = return_binary_or_hexa((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15))\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will calculate the sum of missing numbers between 10 (index 6) and 15 (index 7) in the tuple and return the binary or hexadecimal representation based on the sum's parity.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
