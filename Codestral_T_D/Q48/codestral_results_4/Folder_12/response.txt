Here's the Python code that follows your specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tupl):\n    a = tupl[16]\n    b = tupl[87]\n    missing = [i for i in range(a + 1, b) if i not in tupl[16:87]]\n    sum_missing = sum(missing)\n    if sum_missing % 2 == 0:\n        return hex(sum_missing)[2:]\n    else:\n        return bin(sum_missing)[2:]\n```\n\nThis function works by first extracting the values of 'a' and 'b' from the provided tuple. It then creates a list of all integers between 'a' and 'b' that are not present in the specified range of the tuple. The sum of these missing integers is calculated, and the function returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of this sum, depending on whether the sum is even or odd. If all integers in the range are present in the tuple, the sum is zero, and the function returns an empty string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
