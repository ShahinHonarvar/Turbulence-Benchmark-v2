This function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. It calculates the sum of all integers from the integer at index 0 (a) + 1 to the integer at index 4 (b) - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 0 and 4.\n\nIf the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum (without the '0b' prefix). Otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum (without the '0x' prefix). The letters in the hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n\nIf all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.\n\nYou can now use the 'return_binary_or_hexa' function to perform the desired calculations.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
