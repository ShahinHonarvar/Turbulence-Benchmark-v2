It then calculates the set of missing numbers between 'a' and 'b' that are not present in the tuple. The sum of these missing numbers is calculated. If the sum is odd, the binary representation is returned without the '0b' prefix. If the sum is even and greater than zero, the hexadecimal representation is returned without the '0x' prefix. If all numbers in the range are present in the tuple, an empty string is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
