Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup[46]\n    b = tup[91]\n    missing = set(range(a + 1, b)) - set(tup[46:92])\n    sum_missing = sum(missing)\n    if sum_missing % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_missing)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_missing)[2:]\n```\n\nThis function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as input. It extracts the 47th and 92nd elements (indices 46 and 91, respectively) and stores them in `a` and `b`. It then calculates the set of missing numbers in the range from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the tuple between indices 46 and 91. If the sum of the missing numbers is odd, the function returns its binary representation. If the sum is even, it returns the hexadecimal representation. If all numbers in the range are present in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
