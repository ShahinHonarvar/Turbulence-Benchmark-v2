Here's the Python function as per your specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(t):\n    a = t[13]\n    b = t[76]\n    missing = set(range(a + 1, b)) - set(t[13:76])\n    sum_missing = sum(missing)\n    if sum_missing % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_missing)[2:]\n    elif sum_missing > 0:\n        return hex(sum_missing)[2:]\n    else:\n        return ''\n```\n\nThis function first extracts 'a' and 'b' from the given tuple. It then creates a set of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 and subtracts the set of integers from the tuple between indices 13 and 76. The sum of these missing integers is calculated. If the sum is odd, the binary representation is returned. If the sum is even and non-zero, the hexadecimal representation is returned. If all integers are present in the specified range in the tuple, an empty string is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
