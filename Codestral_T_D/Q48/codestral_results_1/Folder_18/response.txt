This function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as an argument. It calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 56 and 90. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string. The binary representation is not prefixed with \'0b\', and the hexadecimal representation is not prefixed with \'0x\'. The binary and hexadecimal representations start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in the hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. Here is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers):\n    a = numbers[56]\n    b = numbers[90]\n    missing_numbers = set(range(a + 1, b))\n    present_numbers = set(numbers[56+1:90])\n    missing_sum = sum(missing_numbers - present_numbers)\n    if missing_sum % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(missing_sum)[2:]\n    elif missing_sum == 0:\n        return ""\n    else:\n        return hex(missing_sum)[2:]\n```', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
