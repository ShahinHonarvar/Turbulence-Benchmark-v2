The function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as an argument. It then calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 60 and 90. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation does not have the '0b' prefix, and the hexadecimal representation does not have the '0x' prefix. The binary and hexadecimal representations start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in the hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(nums):\n    a = nums[60]\n    b = nums[90]\n    missing_nums = set(range(a + 1, b)) - set(nums[60:90])\n    sum_missing = sum(missing_nums)\n    if sum_missing % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_missing)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_missing)[2:]\n```\n\nYou can use this function to calculate the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum of missing numbers between indices 60 and 90 in a given tuple.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
