This function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as its argument.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n1. It retrieves the values of 'a' (the integer at index 44) and 'b' (the integer at index 91).\n2. It calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 44 and 91.\n3. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum. The binary representation does not have a '0b' prefix and starts with the most significant digit with no leading zeros.\n4. If the sum is an even number, the function returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The hexadecimal representation does not have a '0x' prefix and starts with the most significant digit with no leading zeros. The letters in the hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n5. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.\n\nI have executed the code and the function `return_binary_or_hexa` is now defined. You can use this function to calculate the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum based on the given tuple.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
