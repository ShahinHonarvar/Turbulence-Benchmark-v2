The function calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the tuple between indices 3 and 9. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum. The binary representation does not have a prefix of '0b' and the hexadecimal representation does not have a prefix of '0x'. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.\n```python\nreturn_binary_or_hexa((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10))\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
