For each word in the list that has at least three characters, it sorts the characters (in a case-insensitive manner) and joins them back into a string. This sorted string is used as a key to count the occurrences of each anagram in the list. If the sum of combinations of all anagram pairs is less than or equal to 276, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
