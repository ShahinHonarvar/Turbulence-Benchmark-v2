For each string in the list, it checks if the string's length is at least three. If it is, it counts the frequency of each character in the string (in a case-insensitive manner) and uses this frequency counter as a key in a dictionary. The value associated with each key is the number of anagrams of that string. Finally, it calculates the number of pairs of anagrams and checks if it is at most 88. If it is, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
