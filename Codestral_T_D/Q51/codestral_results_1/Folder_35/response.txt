This function takes a list of strings as an argument.\n\nIt first creates a dictionary called 'anagram_count' to store the count of anagrams for each sorted string. It then iterates through each word in the input list. For each word, it converts it to lowercase, sorts the letters in the word, and uses the sorted word as a key in the 'anagram_count' dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, it increments the count by one. If it doesn't exist, it adds the key to the dictionary with a count of one.\n\nAfter iterating through all the words, the function calculates the total number of anagram pairs by summing up the counts of anagrams for each sorted string and dividing it by 2 (since each anagram pair is counted twice). If the total number of anagram pairs is less than or equal to 210, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(words):\n    anagram_count = {}\n    for word in words:\n        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word.lower()))\n        if sorted_word in anagram_count:\n            anagram_count[sorted_word] += 1\n        else:\n            anagram_count[sorted_word] = 1\n    total_pairs = sum(count * (count - 1) // 2 for count in anagram_count.values())\n    return total_pairs <= 210\n```\n\nYou can use this function to check if a given list of strings contains anagram pairs according to the specified conditions.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
