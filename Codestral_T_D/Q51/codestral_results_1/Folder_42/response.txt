It only considers strings of length at least three. It then uses a frozenset of these Counters as a key in a main Counter, which allows it to identify anagrams. Finally, it calculates the number of pairs of anagrams and returns True if this number is less than or equal to 38, and False otherwise.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
