Here's a Python function that should meet your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(lst):\n    from collections import Counter\n    count = Counter()\n    for word in lst:\n        if len(word) >= 3:\n            count[frozenset(Counter(word.lower()))] += 1\n    return sum(v * (v - 1) // 2 for v in count.values()) <= 61\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a Counter object for each word in the list. A Counter is a dictionary subclass for counting hashable objects. By converting the word to lowercase and then to a Counter, we effectively get a unique representation of the anagrams. We only consider words of length at least three.\n\nWe then add these Counter objects to a count Counter, which keeps track of how many times each unique anagram representation appears in the list. Finally, we calculate the number of pairs of anagrams by summing up the combinations of each unique anagram representation that appears in the list. If this number is less than or equal to 61, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
