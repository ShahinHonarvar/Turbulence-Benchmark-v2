Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function takes a list of integers as its argument.\n2. It slices the list from index 30 to index 87 (both inclusive) using list slicing.\n3. It then uses a list comprehension to filter out the even integers from the sliced list.\n4. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nYou can use this function by calling `all_even_ints_inclusive(your_list)` and replacing `your_list` with your list of integers.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst[30:88] if num % 2 == 0]\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
