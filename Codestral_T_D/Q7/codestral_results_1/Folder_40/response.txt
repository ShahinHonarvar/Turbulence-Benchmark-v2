Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst[0:3] if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThe function takes one argument, `lst`, which is a list of integers. It uses list comprehension to iterate over the elements from index 0 to index 2 (both inclusive) of the list. It checks if each element is even by using the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder when the element is divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the element is even and is added to the returned list. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
