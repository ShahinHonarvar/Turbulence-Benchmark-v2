Here's the Python code that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst[82:87] if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers as an argument and uses list comprehension to iterate over the elements from index 82 to 86 (both inclusive). It then checks if each number is even by using the modulo operator (%). If the number is even, it is added to the new list. If no even numbers are found, an empty list is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
