Here's the Python code that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst[52:72] if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to iterate over the sublist of `lst` from index 52 to 71 (the end index is exclusive, so we use 72 to include index 71). It checks if each number is even by using the modulus operator (`%`), and if it is, it includes it in the new list. If no even numbers are found, the function will return an empty list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
