Here's the Python code that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst[56:99] if i % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to iterate over the slice of the list from index 56 to 98 (99 is exclusive, so we use 99 to include index 98). For each number in this slice, it checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the number is even (i.e., the remainder of the division by 2 is 0), it includes the number in the new list. If no even numbers are found, the function will return an empty list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
