Here's a simple Python function that should do the trick:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [x for x in lst[25:60] if x % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the list from index 25 to 59 (the upper bound is exclusive in Python, so we use 60). For each element, it checks if it's even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of `x % 2` is 0, that means `x` is even, and it's included in the output list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
