Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i']\n    result = []\n    for i in range(20, 34):\n        if i < len(string) and string[i] > 'U' and string[i] <= 'i' and string[i] in vowels:\n            result.append(string[i])\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function takes a single argument, `string`, which represents the input string. It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the vowels that meet the specified conditions.\n\nThe function then iterates over the characters in the string from index 20 (inclusive) to index 34 (exclusive). For each character, it checks if the index is within the bounds of the string, if the character is greater than 'U' and smaller than or equal to 'i', and if the character is a vowel. If all conditions are met, the character is appended to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains all the vowels that meet the specified conditions. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
