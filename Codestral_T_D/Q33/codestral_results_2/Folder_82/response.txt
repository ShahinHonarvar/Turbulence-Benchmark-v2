The function iterates through the characters in the string from index 86 to 99 (exclusive), checks if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), and if it is greater than 'E' and smaller than or equal to 'r'. If the character meets all these conditions, it is added to a list. Finally, the function returns the list of vowels that meet the specified conditions.
