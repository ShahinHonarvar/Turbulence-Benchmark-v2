This function takes a single argument, which is a string. It then checks the characters in the string from index 23 to 38 (exclusive) to see if they are vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and if they are greater than the character 'N' and smaller than or equal to the character 'k'. If the character meets all these conditions, it is added to the list of vowels. Finally, the function returns the list of vowels that meet the specified criteria.
