I will iterate over the string from index 60 to 99 (exclusive). During this iteration, I will check if the current character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) and if it is greater than 'j' and smaller than or equal to 'n'. If such a character is found, I will add it to a list. Finally, I will return this list. If no such characters are found, an empty list will be returned. Here is the Python code for the same.\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(s):\n    vowels = [char for char in s[60:99] if char in 'aeiou' and 'j' < char <= 'n']\n    return vowels\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
