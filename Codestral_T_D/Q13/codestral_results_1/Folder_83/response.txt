If the list is shorter than 91 elements, this will return None as expected. If the list is longer than 90 elements, it will return the element at index 90, which is not the second largest element as the question suggests. If you meant to look at a range of elements, please specify the end index.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
