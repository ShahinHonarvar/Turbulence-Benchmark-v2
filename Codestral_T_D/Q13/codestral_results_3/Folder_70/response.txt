This function will first slice the list from index 28 to 32 (both inclusive) and then find the second largest number in this sliced list. If there is no such element, the function will return 'None'. Let's implement this in Python code.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_largest_num(numbers):\n    sliced_list = numbers[28:33]\n    if len(sliced_list) < 2:\n        return None\n    else:\n        max_num = max(sliced_list)\n        return max([num for num in sliced_list if num < max_num])\n```\n\nThis function works by first slicing the input list to obtain a new list containing elements from index 28 to 32. It then checks if this sliced list has at least two elements. If not, it returns 'None' because there is no second largest element. If there are at least two elements, it finds the maximum number in the sliced list and then finds the maximum number among the elements that are less than this maximum. This gives us the second largest number, which is then returned by the function.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
