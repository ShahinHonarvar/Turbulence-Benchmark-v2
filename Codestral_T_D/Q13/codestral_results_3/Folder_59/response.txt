Here is the Python code for your function:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_largest_num(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n        return None\n    first, second = None, None\n    for num in numbers[:10]:\n        if num > first:\n            second = first\n            first = num\n        elif num > second and num != first:\n            second = num\n    return second\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the list has less than two elements, in which case it returns `None`. It then initializes two variables, `first` and `second`, to `None`. It then iterates over the first 10 numbers in the list. For each number, if it's larger than `first`, it updates `second` to be the current value of `first` and `first` to be the current number. If the number is not larger than `first` but is larger than `second` and not equal to `first`, it updates `second` to be the current number. At the end of the function, it returns the value of `second`, which is the second largest number in the list (or `None` if there is no such number).", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
