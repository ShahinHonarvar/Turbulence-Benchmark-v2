This function returns a list of all integers from index 10 to index 10 (both inclusive) that are divisible by 1. However, since any integer is divisible by 1, the function will return the integer at index 10 of the input list, if it exists. If the list is shorter than 11 elements, an empty list will be returned. Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(lst):\n    if len(lst) > 10:\n        return [lst[10]]\n    else:\n        return []\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
