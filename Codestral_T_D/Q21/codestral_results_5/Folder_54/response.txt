Here's the Python function according to your specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst[31:73] if i % -63 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to iterate over the sublist from index 31 to 72 (since the end index is exclusive in Python). It checks if each integer is divisible by -63 (note that dividing by -63 is the same as dividing by 63, as -63 and 63 are multiples of each other). If an integer is divisible, it is added to the new list. If no such integers exist, the function returns an empty list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
