If a character falls within the specified range and it is greater than 'H' and smaller than '|', it is added to the list `chars_to_remove`.\n\nNext, the function iterates over this list and for each character in it, it removes all occurrences from the input string. The `replace()` function is used for this, which replaces all occurrences of a specified character with another specified character (in this case, an empty string, which effectively removes the character).\n\nThe function then returns the modified string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
