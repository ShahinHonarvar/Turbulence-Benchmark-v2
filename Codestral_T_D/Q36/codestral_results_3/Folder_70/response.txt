Here's the Python function you described:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for char in s[170:195]:\n        if '!' < char < '}':\n            s = s.replace(char, '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the substring of `s` from indices 170 to 195. If a character in that substring is greater than '!' and less than '}', it replaces all occurrences of that character in `s` with an empty string, effectively removing it. The function then returns the modified string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
