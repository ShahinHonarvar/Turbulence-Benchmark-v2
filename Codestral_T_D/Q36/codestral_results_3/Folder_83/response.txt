The function takes one argument, which is a string. It iterates over each character in the string between the indices 72 and 93 (exclusive). If a character is greater than '<' and smaller than 'J', all occurrences of that character are removed from the string while maintaining the order of the remaining characters. Finally, the altered string is returned.\n\nYou can use the `filter_chars` function like this:\n\n```python\nfiltered_string = filter_chars('your_string_here')\n```\n\nReplace `'your_string_here'` with the string you want to filter. The function will return the filtered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
