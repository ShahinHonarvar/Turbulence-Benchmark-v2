Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for c in s[3:9]:\n        if '*' < c < 'E':\n            s = s.replace(c, '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the characters in the string between indices 3 and 9. If a character is greater than '*' and smaller than 'E', it replaces all occurrences of that character with an empty string. Finally, it returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
