It iterates over each character in the string between indices 15 and 85 (exclusive). If a character is greater than 'I' and smaller than 'M', it removes all occurrences of that character from the string while keeping the order of all characters intact. Finally, it returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
