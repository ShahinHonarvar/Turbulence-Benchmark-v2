The function should remove all occurrences of certain characters within the string, based on their ASCII values. If a character is between the indices 39 and 87 (exclusive) in the string and its ASCII value is greater than '!' and smaller than '}', then all occurrences of that character in the string should be removed.\n\nHere's the Python code for the 'filter_chars' function:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for i in range(39, 87):\n        if '!' < s[i] < '}':\n            s = s.replace(s[i], '')\n    return s\n```\n\nI will now execute this code to make sure it works as expected.\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for i in range(39, 87):\n        if '!' < s[i] < '}':\n            s = s.replace(s[i], '')\n    return s\n\n# Test the function\nprint(filter_chars('abc!def$ghi}jkl'))\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
