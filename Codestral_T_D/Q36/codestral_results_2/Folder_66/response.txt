Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for char in string[39:87]:\n        if '!' < char < '}':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```\n\nThe function 'filter_chars' takes a string as an argument. It iterates over the characters between indices 39 and 87 (exclusive) in the string. If a character is greater than '!' and smaller than '}', the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string while keeping the order of all characters intact. Finally, it returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
