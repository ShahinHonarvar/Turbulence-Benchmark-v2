Here\'s how it works:\n\nThe function takes a string as input. It iterates over each character in the string between the indices 0 and 3 (exclusive). If the character is greater than \'$\' and smaller than \'?\', the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string while keeping the order of all characters intact. Finally, the function returns the altered string.\n\nYou can use the \'filter_chars\' function by calling it with a string as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = filter_chars("abc$def?ghi")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n$def?\n```\n\nSince \'a\', \'b\', and \'c\' are greater than \'$\' and smaller than \'?\', they are removed from the string, while the other characters are kept intact.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
