Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for i in range(61, 88):\n        char = string[i]\n        if '%' < char < 'q':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```\n\nThe function takes a string as an argument. It iterates over the characters between indices 61 and 88 (exclusive). If a character is greater than '%' and smaller than 'q', all occurrences of that character are removed from the string. Finally, the altered string is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
