Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for i in range(309, 591):\n        if 'S' < s[i] < 'm':\n            s = s.replace(s[i], '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThe function takes a string 's' as an argument. It then iterates over the characters between the indices 309 and 591 (exclusive) of the string. If a character is greater than 'S' and smaller than 'm', the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string while keeping the order of all characters intact. Finally, the function returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
