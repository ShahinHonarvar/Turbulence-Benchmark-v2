The function will iterate through each character between the indices 15 and 85 (exclusive) in the string. If the character is greater than 'I' and smaller than 'M', the function will remove all occurrences of that character from the string while preserving the order of the remaining characters. Finally, the function will return the modified string.\n\nHere is the Python code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for char in string[15:85]:\n        if 'I' < char < 'M':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
