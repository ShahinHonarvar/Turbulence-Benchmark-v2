Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for char in s[52:88]:\n        if '&' < char < 'c':\n            s = s.replace(char, '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThe function takes a string `s` as input. It iterates over the characters between indices 52 and 88 (exclusive) in the string. If a character is greater than '&' and smaller than 'c', the function removes all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. Finally, the function returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
