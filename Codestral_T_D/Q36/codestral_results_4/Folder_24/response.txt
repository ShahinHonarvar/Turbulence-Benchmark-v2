Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for char in s[10:15]:\n        if 't' < char < 'v':\n            s = s.replace(char, '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThe function takes a string 's' as its argument. It iterates over the characters between the indices 10 and 15 (exclusive) of the string. If a character is greater than 't' and smaller than 'v', it removes all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters intact. The function returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
