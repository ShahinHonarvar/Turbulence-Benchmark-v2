Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(input_string):\n    for char in input_string[3:5]:\n        if 'Y' < char < 's':\n            input_string = input_string.replace(char, '')\n    return input_string\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the characters between the indices 3 and 5 (exclusive) of the input string. If a character is found that is greater than 'Y' and smaller than 's', all occurrences of that character are removed from the string while preserving the order of the remaining characters. The altered string is then returned as the output of the function.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
