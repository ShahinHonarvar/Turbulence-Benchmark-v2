Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for char in s[46:74]:\n        if '&' < char < 'M':\n            s = s.replace(char, '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThis function iteratively checks each character in the string from index 46 to 74. If the character is greater than '&' and less than 'M', the function will replace all occurrences of that character with an empty string. Finally, it returns the modified string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
