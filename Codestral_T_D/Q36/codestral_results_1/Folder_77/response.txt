Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for char in string[221:419]:\n        if '-' < char < 'v':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```\n\nThe function takes a string as an argument. It iterates over each character in the given string between indices 221 and 419 (exclusive). If the character is greater than '-' and smaller than 'v', it removes all occurrences of that character from the string while keeping the order of all characters intact. Finally, it returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
