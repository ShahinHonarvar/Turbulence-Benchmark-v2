This function takes a string as input and iterates over the characters between indices 78 and 81 (exclusive) of the given string. If a character is greater than 'S' and smaller than '[', the function removes all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. Finally, the function returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
