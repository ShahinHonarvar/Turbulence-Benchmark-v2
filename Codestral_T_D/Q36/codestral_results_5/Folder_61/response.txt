Here's a Python function called 'filter_chars' that should meet your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = [char for char in s[3:9] if '*' < char < 'E']\n    for char in chars_to_remove:\n        s = s.replace(char, '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThis function first identifies the characters between the 3rd and 9th indices of the input string that are greater than '*' and less than 'E'. It then removes all occurrences of these characters from the string and returns the modified string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
