Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for i in range(90, 97):\n        char = string[i]\n        if 'j' < char < 'w':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```\n\nThe function `filter_chars` takes a string as an argument. It iterates over each character in the string with indices between 90 and 97 (both exclusive). If the character is greater than 'j' and smaller than 'w', it removes all occurrences of that character from the string while keeping the order of all characters intact. Finally, the function returns the altered string.\n\nYou can use this function by calling `filter_chars(<string>)`, replacing `<string>` with the input string you want to filter.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
