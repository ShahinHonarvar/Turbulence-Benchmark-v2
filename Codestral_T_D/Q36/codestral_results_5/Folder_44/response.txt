Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function iterates through each character in the string between the indices 18 and 64 (exclusive).\n2. If the character is greater than '3' and smaller than 'B', all occurrences of that character are removed from the string.\n3. The function returns the altered string.\n\nHere's the Python code for the 'filter_chars' function:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for char in string[18:64]:\n        if '3' < char < 'B':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
