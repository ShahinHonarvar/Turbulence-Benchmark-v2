The function takes one argument, a string. It loops through each character between the indices 72 and 93 (exclusive) in the given string. If the character is greater than '<' and smaller than 'J', the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. Finally, the function returns the altered string.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for char in s[72:93]:\n        if '<' < char < 'J':\n            s = s.replace(char, '')\n    return s\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
