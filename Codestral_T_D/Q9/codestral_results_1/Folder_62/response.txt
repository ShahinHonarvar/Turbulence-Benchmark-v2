This function should take a list of integers as an argument and return a list of all odd integers from index 91 to index 99 (both inclusive). If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef all_odd_ints_inclusive(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers[91:99+1] if num % 2 != 0]\n```\n\nThis code uses list comprehension to iterate over the sublist of numbers from index 91 to 99. It checks if each number is odd by using the modulus operator (%). If a number is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is not zero), it is included in the output list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
