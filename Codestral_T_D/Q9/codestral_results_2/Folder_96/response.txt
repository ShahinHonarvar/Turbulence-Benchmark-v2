Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef all_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst[50:201] if num % 2 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the list (from index 50 to index 200, inclusive) and include only the numbers that are odd (i.e., those for which the remainder of the division by 2 is not 0).
