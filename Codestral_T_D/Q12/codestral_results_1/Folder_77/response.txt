Within this function, I will use Python's built-in min function to find the smallest number in the sublist that spans from index 661 to index 924, both inclusive. Here is the Python code that implements this:\n\n```python\ndef find_smallest_num(numbers):\n    return min(numbers[661:925])\n```\n\nThis function uses Python's list slicing feature to create a sublist that starts at index 661 and ends at index 924. The min function is then used to find the smallest number in this sublist, which is then returned by the function.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
