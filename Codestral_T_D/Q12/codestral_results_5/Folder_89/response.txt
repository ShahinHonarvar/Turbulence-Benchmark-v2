Here's a simple Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef find_smallest_num(numbers):\n    return min(numbers[22:51])\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of numbers as an argument. It uses Python's built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in the slice of the list from index 22 to 51 (which is inclusive of both ends, since the upper bound in Python slicing is exclusive).", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
