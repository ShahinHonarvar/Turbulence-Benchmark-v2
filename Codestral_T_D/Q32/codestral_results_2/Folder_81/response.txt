This function replaces any occurrences of the character 'A' in the string with 'AA'. This results in a string that is identical, except that every occurrence of 'A' now has another 'A' immediately following it. Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(s):\n    return s.replace('A', 'AA')\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a string as an argument, like this:\n\n```python\nprint(insert_after_character('APPLE'))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```python\n'APPAAPPLPE'\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
