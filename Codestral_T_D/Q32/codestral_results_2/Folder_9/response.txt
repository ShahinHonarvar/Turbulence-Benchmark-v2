Here's my approach:\n\nI will define a function 'insert_after_character' that takes a string as an argument. In this function, I will use the 'replace' method of strings in Python, which replaces all occurrences of a substring in a string with another substring. In this case, I will replace each 'e' with 'eE'.\n\nLet's proceed to write and execute the code.\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(s):\n    return s.replace('e', 'eE')\n```\nI have defined the function 'insert_after_character' as per your requirements. It replaces every 'e' in the input string with 'eE'.\n\nLet's test this function with a simple string to ensure that it's working as expected. I will use the string 'apple' as a test case.\n```python\ninsert_after_character('apple')\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
