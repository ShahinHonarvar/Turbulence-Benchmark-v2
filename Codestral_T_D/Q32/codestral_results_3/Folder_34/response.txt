Here\'s an example of how you can use the function:\n\n```python\nresult = insert_after_character("Hello World")\nprint(result)  # Output: "Hello World"\n\nresult = insert_after_character("AppleBanana")\nprint(result)  # Output: "AappleBanana"\n```\n\nIn the first example, there is no occurrence of character \'A\', so the output is the same as the input. In the second example, there is an occurrence of character \'A\', so \'a\' is inserted immediately succeeding it.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
