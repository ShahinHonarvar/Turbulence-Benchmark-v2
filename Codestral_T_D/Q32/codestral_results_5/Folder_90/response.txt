This function will take a string as an argument and iterate through each character in the string. If the current character is 'U', it will add 'F' to the output string; otherwise, it will add the current character. Let me do that.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(s):\n    return ''.join('F' + c if c == 'U' else c for c in s)\n```\n\nI've created the function 'insert_after_character' which takes a string 's' as input. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string. If the character is 'U', it adds 'F' and the character to the output string; otherwise, it adds the character to the output string. Finally, it joins all the characters in the output list into a single string and returns it.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
