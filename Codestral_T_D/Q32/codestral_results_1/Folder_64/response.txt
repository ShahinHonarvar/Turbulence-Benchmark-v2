It takes a single argument, which is a string. The function returns a new string that is identical to the input string, except that an additional 'u' is inserted immediately after any occurrence of the character 'u'.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. It uses the string method 'replace' to replace all instances of 'u' with 'uu'.\n2. This effectively inserts a 'u' after each 'u' in the string.\n\nYou can now use this function to modify any string according to the specified rule.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
