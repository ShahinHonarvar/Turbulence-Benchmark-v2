We also keep track of the product of the numbers in the current sublist and the current sum.\n\nIf the current product equals -115, we add the sublist to the result. If the product is greater than -115, we move the left pointer to the right and divide the current product by the left number to remove it from the current product. If the product is smaller than -115, we move the right pointer to the right and multiply the current product by the right number to add it to the current product.\n\nSince the list is circular, we need to handle the wrap around case. We can do this by doubling the list and iterate through the doubled list.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n    nums = nums + nums\n    ans = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        prod = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            prod *= nums[j]\n            sublist.append(nums[j])\n            while prod > 115:\n                prod /= nums[i]\n                sublist.pop(0)\n                i += 1\n            if prod == 115:\n                ans.append(sublist)\n    return ans\n```\n\nThis function first doubles the input list to handle the wrap around case. It then iterates through the list using two pointers, i and j. The product of the numbers in the current sublist is kept in the variable prod. If prod equals 115, the current sublist is added to the answer. If prod is greater than 115, the left pointer is moved to the right and the left number is removed from the current product. If prod is smaller than 115, the right pointer is moved to the right and the right number is added to the current product. This process is repeated until the right pointer has iterated through the entire list. The function then returns the answer.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
