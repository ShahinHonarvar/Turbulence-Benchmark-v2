The function returns a list of sublists, each of which contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -81.\n\nIf no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = -81\n    result = []\n    size = len(circular_list)\n    circular_list += circular_list\n\n    for i in range(size):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = deque()\n\n        for j in range(i, size + i):\n            product *= circular_list[j]\n            sublist.append(circular_list[j])\n\n            while product > n and sublist:\n                product /= sublist.popleft()\n\n            if product == n and len(sublist) > 1:\n                result.append(list(sublist))\n\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a circular list of integers as an argument. The function will return a list of sublists that satisfy the given condition.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
