The function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 632. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. Duplicates of such sublists are included in the returned list, and the order of sublists does not matter.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst_extended = lst + lst\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= lst_extended[j]\n            sublist.append(lst_extended[j])\n\n            if product == 632:\n                result.append(sublist)\n\n            if product >= 632:\n                break\n\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `lists_with_product_equal_n(your_list)`, where `your_list` is the circular list of integers. The function will return the list of sublists that meet the specified condition.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
