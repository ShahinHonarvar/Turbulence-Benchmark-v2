This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists. Each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -20.\n\nIf no such sublist exists, the function will return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere's the Python code for the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    size = len(lst)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(size):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, i + size):\n            product *= lst[j % size]\n            if product == -20:\n                result.append(lst[i:j % size + 1])\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a circular list of integers as an argument.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
