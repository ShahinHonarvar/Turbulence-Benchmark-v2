If the product equals -22, add the sublist to the result. If the product becomes greater than -22, remove elements from the beginning of the sublist until the product is less than or equal to -22. If the product becomes less than -22, add elements from the end of the sublist until the product is greater than or equal to -22.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -22\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, len(lst) + i):\n            product *= lst[j % len(lst)]\n            sublist.append(lst[j % len(lst)])\n            while product > n:\n                product /= sublist.pop(0)\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist.copy())\n            if product < n:\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the product of the elements in the sublist is equal to -22. If it is, the sublist is added to the result list. If the product is greater than -22, the function removes elements from the beginning of the sublist until the product is less than or equal to -22. If the product is less than -22, the function breaks the inner loop to move on to the next sublist. The function uses the modulo operator to handle the circular nature of the list.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
