Here is the Python code for the function you described:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = 537\n    result = []\n    circular_lst = deque(lst)\n    for _ in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for num in circular_lst:\n            product *= num\n            sublist.append(num)\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n            elif product > n:\n                while product > n and sublist:\n                    product /= sublist.pop(0)\n                    if product == n:\n                        result.append(sublist)\n        circular_lst.rotate(-1)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the list into a deque, which allows for efficient rotation. It then iterates through the circular list, maintaining a running product of the numbers in the current sublist. If the product equals 537, the sublist is added to the result. If the product is greater than 537, the function removes numbers from the beginning of the sublist until the product is either equal to 537 or less than 537. This process is repeated for each rotation of the circular list.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
