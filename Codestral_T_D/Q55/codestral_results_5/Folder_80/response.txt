Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circ_list):\n    n = 43\n    size = len(circ_list)\n    circ_list *= 2  # make the list circular\n    results = []\n\n    for start in range(size):\n        product = 1\n        for end in range(start, start + size):\n            product *= circ_list[end]\n            if product == n:\n                results.append(circ_list[start:end + 1])\n            elif product > n:\n                break\n\n    return results\n```\n\nThis function works by looping over each possible starting point in the list. For each starting point, it multiplies the elements of the list together until the product is either equal to 43 or greater than 43. If the product is equal to 43, it adds the sublist to the results. If the product is greater than 43, it breaks out of the inner loop and moves on to the next starting point. The function doubles the size of the input list to handle the circular nature of the list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
