Here's the Python code that fulfills the requirements according to the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = 3\n    result = []\n    lst += lst  # make list circular\n\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, len(lst)):\n            product *= lst[j]\n            sublist.append(lst[j])\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n            if product > n:\n                break\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns all sublists where the product of their elements equals 3. The function iterates over the list twice, using the first loop to start at each possible index and the second loop to calculate the product of elements from that index to the end of the list. If the product is equal to 3, the sublist is added to the result. If the product is greater than 3, the inner loop breaks because it is no longer possible for the product to equal 3 from this starting index. The function also makes the list circular by concatenating it with itself.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
