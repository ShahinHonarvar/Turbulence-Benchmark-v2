Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return []\n\n    n = -51\n    result = []\n    queue = deque([(lst[0], [lst[0]], lst[0])])\n\n    while queue:\n        curr, sublist, product = queue.popleft()\n        for i in range(len(lst)):\n            next = lst[(i + 1) % len(lst)]\n            new_product = product * next\n            new_sublist = sublist + [next]\n            if new_product == n:\n                result.append(new_sublist)\n            queue.append((next, new_sublist, new_product))\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function uses a deque (double-ended queue) to keep track of the current element, the sublist ending with that element, and the product of the elements in that sublist. It then iterates over the list, updating these values as it goes. When it finds a sublist with a product of -51, it adds that sublist to the result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
