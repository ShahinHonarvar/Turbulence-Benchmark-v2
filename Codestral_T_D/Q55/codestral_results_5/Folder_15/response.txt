This function should return a list of sublists, where each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -7. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. Duplicates should be included in the returned list, and the order of sublists does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -7\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, len(lst) + i):\n            product *= lst[j % len(lst)]\n            sublist.append(lst[j % len(lst)])\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n            if product != 0 and n % product != 0:\n                break\n    return result\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
