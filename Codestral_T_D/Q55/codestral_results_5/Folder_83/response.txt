This function goes through all possible sublists of the given list and checks if the product of their elements equals -57. If such sublists are found, they're added to the result list. Finally, the function returns this result list.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    result = []\n    n = len(nums)\n    nums = nums + nums\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= nums[j]\n            if product == -57:\n                result.append(nums[i:j + 1])\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will return a list of sublists that meet the criteria, or an empty list if no such sublists exist.\n\nNote that the function treats the input list as a circular list, meaning that the head and tail are adjacent. To achieve this, the function duplicates the input list and iterates over it twice. This allows for sublists that span over the edge of the original list to be considered.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. This is because the function checks all possible sublists of the list, which takes O(n^2) time. The space complexity is O(n), which is the space required to store the result list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
