The function returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -76. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -76\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, len(lst)):\n            product *= lst[j % len(lst)]\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(lst[i:j+1])\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can call the function with a circular list of integers as an argument to get the desired result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
