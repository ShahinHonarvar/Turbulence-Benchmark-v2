This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists. Each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -75. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code for the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    result = []\n    n = len(circular_list)\n    circular_list += circular_list\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, i+n):\n            product = 1\n            sublist = []\n            for k in range(i, j+1):\n                product *= circular_list[k]\n                sublist.append(circular_list[k])\n                if product == -75 and sublist not in result:\n                    result.append(sublist)\n\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function to find all sublists in a circular list that have a product equal to -75.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
