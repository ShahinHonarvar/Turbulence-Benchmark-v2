This function returns a list of sublists, each containing contiguous integers from the given list, such that their product equals -36. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be included in the returned list. The order of the sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst = lst + lst  # Make the list circular\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= lst[j]\n            sublist.append(lst[j])\n            if product == -36:\n                result.append(sublist)\n            if product == 0:\n                break  # Reset product for the next sublist\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function to find sublists with a product of -36 in a circular list of integers.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
