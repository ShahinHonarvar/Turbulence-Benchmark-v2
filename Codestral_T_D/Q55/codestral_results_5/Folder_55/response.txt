The function returns a list of sublists, each of which contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -6.\n\nThe function uses a sliding window approach to find the sublists. It iterates over the circular list using two pointers, `i` and `j`, which represent the start and end indices of the current sublist. The function calculates the product of the elements in the sublist and checks if it equals -6. If it does, the sublist is added to the result list.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by duplicating the list and concatenating it with the original list. This allows us to iterate over the list in a circular manner without having to handle the wraparound explicitly.\n\nThe function returns an empty list if no such sublist exists. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
