This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument. It returns a list of sublists, each containing contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 27. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst += lst  # make the list circular\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, i+n):\n            product *= lst[j]\n            if product == 27:\n                result.append(lst[i:j+1])\n                product = 1\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function to find sublists with a product equal to 27 in a circular list of integers.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
