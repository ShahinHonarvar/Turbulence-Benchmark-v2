This function will return a list of sublists, where each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -20. The function will consider the list to be circular, meaning the head and tail are adjacent.\n\nTo achieve this, I will iterate over each possible sublist of the given list (including wrap-around sublists due to the circular nature), calculate the product of its elements, and if the product equals -20, add it to the result list.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= lst[j % n]\n            sublist.append(lst[j % n])\n            if product == -20:\n                result.append(sublist.copy())\n            if product == 0:  # No need to continue if product becomes 0\n                break\n    return result\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
