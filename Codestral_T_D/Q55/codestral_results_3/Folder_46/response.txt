I'll take care to handle the circular list nature by doubling it to simplify the sublist search.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    # Double the list to account for circular nature\n    double_lst = lst + lst\n    n = len(lst)\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over all possible sublist lengths\n    for length in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Iterate over all indices of the current length\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get the sublist\n            sublist = double_lst[i:i + length]\n            # Check if the product equals 53\n            if prod(sublist) == 53:\n                result.append(sublist)\n\n    return result\n\ndef prod(lst):\n    p = 1\n    for i in lst:\n        p *= i\n    return p\n```\n\nIn the provided code, the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` first duplicates the input list to handle the circular nature of the list. Then it checks all possible sublists of length 1 to n (inclusive) in the doubled list. The product of each sublist is calculated using the helper function `prod`. If the product equals 53, the sublist is added to the result list. Finally, the function returns the list of all sublists whose product equals 53.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
