The code defines a function called `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes a circular list of integers as an argument. This function returns a list of sublists, each of which contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -115. If no such sublist exists, an empty list is returned. The function handles circular lists, duplicates, and does not require specific order of sublists in the returned list. Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst += lst\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= lst[j]\n            if product == -115:\n                result.append(lst[i:j + 1])\n            if product == 0:\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `lists_with_product_equal_n(your_list)`, where `your_list` is the circular list of integers you want to pass to the function. The function will return a list of sublists that meet the specified criteria.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
