The function takes a circular list of integers as an argument.\n2. It iterates over each index in the range of the length of the circular list.\n3. For each index, it calculates the product of the elements in the sublist starting from that index and iterates over the length of the circular list.\n4. If the product equals -87, it adds the sublist to the result list.\n5. Finally, it returns the result list containing all the sublists with a product equal to -87.\n\nNow you can use the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function to find sublists in a circular list whose product equals -87.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
