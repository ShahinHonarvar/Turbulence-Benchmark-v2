Here's how I'd approach it:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the list as a starting point.\n2. For each starting point, iterate over each possible length of contiguous sublists.\n3. Calculate the product of each sublist.\n4. If the product equals -33, add the sublist to the result list.\n5. Since the list is circular, we need to consider the case where the sublist wraps around from the end of the list to the beginning.\n6. To handle this, we can extend the list by appending a copy of itself to itself, effectively creating a temporary list that is twice the size of the original list.\n7. This way, we can still find all contiguous sublists of any size, even if they wrap around from the end of the list to the beginning.\n8. Finally, we return the result list.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -33\n    result = []\n    lst *= 2\n    for i in range(len(lst) // 2):\n        for j in range(i + 1, i + len(lst) // 2 + 1):\n            sublist = lst[i:j]\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
