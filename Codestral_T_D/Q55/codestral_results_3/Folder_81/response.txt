This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists that contain contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -8. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    result = []\n    n = len(circular_list)\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i+n):\n            product *= circular_list[j % n]\n            sublist.append(circular_list[j % n])\n            if product == -8:\n                result.append(sublist)\n            elif product != 0 and abs(product) < 8:\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a circular list of integers as an argument.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
