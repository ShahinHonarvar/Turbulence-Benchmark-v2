This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists, each containing contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -15. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -15\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, len(lst)):\n            product *= lst[(j - i) % len(lst)]\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(lst[i:j+1])\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a circular list of integers as an argument. It will return a list of sublists that meet the specified conditions.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
