If the product equals 74, it adds the sublist to the result. If the product exceeds 74, it removes elements from the beginning of the sublist until the product is less than or equal to 74 again. This ensures that all sublists of length greater than 1 are considered without having to generate all possible sublists, which would be inefficient for large lists.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
