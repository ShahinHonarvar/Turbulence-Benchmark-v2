This function will return a list of sublists, where each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 78. If no such sublist exists, the function will return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code for this function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            product = 1\n            sublist = []\n            for k in range(i, j + 1):\n                product *= lst[k % n]\n                sublist.append(lst[k % n])\n                if product == 78:\n                    result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can test the function with different circular lists to see if it returns the correct sublists.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
