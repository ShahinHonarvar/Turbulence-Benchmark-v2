It duplicates the input list to handle the circular case, and then it uses a deque to keep track of the current sublist. It iterates over the list, and for each element, it multiplies the current product by that element and adds it to the current sublist. If the product becomes larger than -690, it removes elements from the left of the sublist until the product is less than or equal to -690. If the product becomes equal to -690, it adds the current sublist to the result list. This process continues until it has checked all possible sublists.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
