The function handles the circular nature of the list by concatenating the input list to itself. It then iterates through the extended list, calculating the product of each sublist. If the product equals 90, the sublist is added to the result list. The function also handles the case where the product is greater than 90 or where an element of the list is 0, in both cases breaking the inner loop to move to the next sublist. The function returns an empty list if no such sublist exists.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
