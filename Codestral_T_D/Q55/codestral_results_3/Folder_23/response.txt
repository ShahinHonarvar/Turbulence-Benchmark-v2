For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements and checks if it equals -95. If it does, the sublist is added to the list of sublists. If the product becomes smaller than -95, the function breaks out of the inner loop since any subsequent sublists will not have a product of -95.\n\nPlease note that this function might return duplicate sublists if there are duplicates in the circular list. To avoid this, we can convert the sublists to tuples before adding them to the list of sublists. This will ensure that the list of sublists does not contain any duplicates.\n\nHere's the updated function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    sublists = []\n    n = -95\n    length = len(circular_list)\n    circular_list += circular_list\n\n    for i in range(length):\n        for j in range(i+1, 2*length):\n            product = 1\n            for k in range(i, j):\n                product *= circular_list[k]\n                if product == n:\n                    sublists.append(tuple(circular_list[i:j]))\n            if product < n:\n                break\n    return [list(sublist) for sublist in set(sublists)]\n```\n\nThis updated function converts the sublists to tuples before adding them to the list of sublists. This ensures that the list of sublists does not contain any duplicates. The function then converts the tuples back to lists before returning the list of sublists.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
