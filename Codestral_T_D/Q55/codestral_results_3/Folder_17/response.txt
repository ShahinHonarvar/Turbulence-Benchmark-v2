This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument. It searches for contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 18. The function returns a list of sublists that meet this condition. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst = lst + lst\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, i+n+1):\n            product = 1\n            for k in range(i, j):\n                product *= lst[k]\n            if product == 18:\n                result.append(lst[i:j])\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can call this function with a circular list of integers as the argument to get the desired result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
