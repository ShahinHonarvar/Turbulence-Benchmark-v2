Here's a Python function that should meet your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = 51\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, len(lst)):\n            product *= lst[(j - i) % len(lst)]\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(lst[i:j+1])\n            if product > n:\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the list and then, for each element, it iterates over the subsequent elements. It calculates the product of these elements and checks if it equals 51. If it does, it adds the sublist to the result. If the product becomes greater than 51, it breaks the inner loop because further sublists starting from the current element cannot have a product equal to 51. The use of the modulo operator ensures that the list is treated as circular.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
