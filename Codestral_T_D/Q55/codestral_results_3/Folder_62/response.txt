This function returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 100. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will be included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst *= 2\n    results = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= lst[j]\n            sublist.append(lst[j])\n            if product == 100:\n                results.append(sublist)\n            if product > 100:\n                break\n    return results\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `lists_with_product_equal_n(your_list)`, where `your_list` is the circular list of integers.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
