The function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists, each containing the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -16. The function handles both positive and negative integers, and it considers the list to be circular, meaning that the head and tail are adjacent to each other. If no such sublist exists, an empty list is returned. Duplicate sublists are included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list is not important.\n\nHere is the Python code for the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -16\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, len(lst) + i):\n            product *= lst[j % len(lst)]\n            sublist.append(lst[j % len(lst)])\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n                sublist = []\n            elif product != 1 and abs(n) % abs(product) != 0:\n                sublist = []\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `lists_with_product_equal_n(lst)` with a circular list of integers as the argument `lst`. The function will return a list of sublists that meet the specified condition.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
