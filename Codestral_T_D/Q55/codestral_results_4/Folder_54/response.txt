It returns a list of sublists, each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -17. The function handles circular lists by using modulo operation. If no such sublist exists, it returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nLet's test the function with some examples to see if it works as expected.\n```python\nlists_with_product_equal_n([-17, 1, 2, 3, 4])\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
