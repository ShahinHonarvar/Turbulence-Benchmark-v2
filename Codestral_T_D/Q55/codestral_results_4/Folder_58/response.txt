Here's a Python function that should meet your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(numbers):\n    n = len(numbers)\n    numbers = numbers + numbers  # Make the list circular\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= numbers[j]\n            sublist.append(numbers[j])\n            if product == 733:\n                result.append(sublist)\n            elif product > 733:\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each possible starting point in the circular list. For each starting point, it multiplies together the numbers in the list until it either reaches a product of 733 (in which case it adds the sublist to the result), or the product becomes larger than 733 (in which case it stops and moves on to the next starting point). It does this for all possible starting points, and then returns the result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
