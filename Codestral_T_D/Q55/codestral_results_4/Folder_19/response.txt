This function returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -54. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -54\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, len(lst)):\n            product *= lst[j % len(lst)]\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(lst[i:j+1])\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a circular list of integers as the argument. The function will return a list of sublists that meet the specified criteria.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
