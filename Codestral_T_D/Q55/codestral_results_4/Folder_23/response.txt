Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -95\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        prod = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, len(lst) + i):\n            prod *= lst[j % len(lst)]\n            sublist.append(lst[j % len(lst)])\n            if prod == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n            if prod > n:\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the list and then, for each element, it iterates over the elements in the circular list. It keeps track of the product of the elements in the current sublist and checks if it equals -95. If it does, it adds the sublist to the result list. If the product becomes greater than -95, it breaks out of the inner loop because further elements in the sublist will only increase the product.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
