The function takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists. Each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 45.\n\nThe function uses a nested loop to generate all possible sublists of the given list. It checks if the product of each sublist is equal to 45 and adds it to the result list if it is. Finally, the function returns the list of sublists that satisfy the condition.\n\nYou can now use the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function to find sublists with a product of 45 in a circular list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
