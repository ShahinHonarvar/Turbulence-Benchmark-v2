It finds all the contiguous sublists in the given list such that the product of their elements equals 32. The function returns a list of these sublists. If no such sublist exists, an empty list is returned. If there are duplicates, they are all included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst += lst\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n + i):\n            product = 1\n            for k in range(i, j + 1):\n                product *= lst[k]\n                if product > 32:\n                    break\n            if product == 32:\n                result.append(lst[i:j + 1])\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function to find the sublists in a circular list that satisfy the given condition.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
