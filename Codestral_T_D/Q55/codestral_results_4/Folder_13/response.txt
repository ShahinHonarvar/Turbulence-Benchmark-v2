Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    n = 54\n    size = len(nums)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(size):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, size + i):\n            product *= nums[j % size]\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(nums[i:j % size + 1])\n            elif product > n:\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 54. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
