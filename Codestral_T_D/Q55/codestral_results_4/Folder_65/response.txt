This function returns a list of sublists, each containing contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 46. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter. Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst += lst\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        j = i\n        while product < 46:\n            product *= lst[j]\n            j += 1\n        while product >= 46:\n            if product == 46:\n                result.append(lst[i:j])\n            product //= lst[i]\n            i += 1\n    return result\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
