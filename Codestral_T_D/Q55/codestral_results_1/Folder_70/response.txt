The function will return a list of sublists, each containing contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 32. If no such sublist exists, the function will return an empty list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = 32\n    result = []\n    circular_list = deque(circular_list)\n    size = len(circular_list)\n\n    for _ in range(size):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n\n        for i in range(size):\n            product *= circular_list[i]\n            sublist.append(circular_list[i])\n\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n\n            while product >= n:\n                product /= circular_list[i - len(sublist) + 1]\n                sublist.pop(0)\n\n        circular_list.append(circular_list.popleft())\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function uses a sliding window approach to find the sublists with a product equal to 32. It iterates over the circular list and maintains a product variable that keeps track of the product of the current sublist. If the product equals 32, the sublist is added to the result list. If the product becomes greater than or equal to 32, the leftmost element of the sublist is removed until the product becomes less than 32. The circular list is rotated after each iteration to ensure that all possible sublists are considered.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
