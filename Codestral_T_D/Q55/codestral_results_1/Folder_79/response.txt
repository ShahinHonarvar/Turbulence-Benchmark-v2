If it is, then that sublist is added to the result. The sublists are generated by creating a new list by repeating the original list twice, and then generating all sublists of the new list. This ensures that all circular sublists are generated.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    double_lst = lst + lst\n    result = []\n    for r in range(1, len(lst) + 1):\n        for i in range(len(lst)):\n            sublist = double_lst[i:i+r]\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            if product == -83:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
