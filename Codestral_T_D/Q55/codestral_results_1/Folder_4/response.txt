The function will return a list of sublists, each containing contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 91. If no such sublist exists, the function will return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = 91\n    size = len(circular_list)\n    result = []\n    circular_list *= 2\n\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(i+1, i+size):\n            product = 1\n            sublist = deque()\n            for k in range(i, j+1):\n                product *= circular_list[k]\n                sublist.append(circular_list[k])\n                if product > n:\n                    break\n                if product == n:\n                    result.append(list(sublist))\n\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use the 'lists_with_product_equal_n' function by passing a circular list of integers as the argument. The function will return a list of sublists that satisfy the given condition.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
