I'll write a Python function called 'lists_with_product_equal_n' that takes a circular list of integers as an argument. This function will return a list of sublists, each containing contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 54. If no such sublist exists, the function will return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they'll all be included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list is not important.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst = deque(lst * 2)  # make the list circular\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, i + n):\n            if i <= j:\n                sublist = list(lst)[i:j]\n                product = 1\n                for num in sublist:\n                    product *= num\n                if product == 54:\n                    result.append(sublist)\n            else:\n                sublist = list(lst)[i:] + list(lst)[:j]\n                product = 1\n                for num in sublist:\n                    product *= num\n                if product == 54:\n                    result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```\nI have written the function 'lists_with_product_equal_n' as per your specifications. This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument. It returns a list of sublists, each containing contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 54. If no such sublist exists, it returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they're all included in the returned list. The function is now ready for use.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
