The outer loop selects the starting point of the sublist, and the inner loop calculates the product of the sublist starting from the selected index. If the product equals -906, the sublist is added to the result list. If the product is greater than -906, the inner loop breaks, as no further sublist starting from the current index can have a product of -906. If the product is less than -906 and the current element is negative, the product is divided by the current element to avoid unnecessary calculations in the next iterations.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
