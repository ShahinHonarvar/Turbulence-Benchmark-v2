The function returns a list of sublists, each of which contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -51. Each sublist can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n```python\nprint(list(lists_with_product_equal_n([3, -17, 3, 7, -11])))\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
