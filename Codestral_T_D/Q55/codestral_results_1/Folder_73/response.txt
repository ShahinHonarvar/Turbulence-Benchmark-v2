I will create a Python function called 'lists_with_product_equal_n' that takes a circular list of integers as an argument. The function will return all sublists from the given list such that the product of their elements equals 40. If no such sublist exists, the function will return an empty list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter, and duplicates will be included.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            prod = 1\n            sublist = []\n            for k in range(i, j + 1):\n                prod *= nums[k % n]\n                sublist.append(nums[k % n])\n                if prod == 40:\n                    result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible sublists of the given list. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements and checks if it equals 40. If it does, the sublist is added to the result list. The modulo operator is used to handle the circular nature of the list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
