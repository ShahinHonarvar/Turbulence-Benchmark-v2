This function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists. Each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 0. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, i+n):\n            product *= nums[j % n]\n            if product == 0:\n                result.append(nums[i:j % n + 1])\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can call the function with a circular list of integers as an argument to get the desired output.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
