The function returns a list of sublists, each of which contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -87. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i+n):\n            product *= lst[j % n]\n            sublist.append(lst[j % n])\n            if product == -87:\n                result.append(sublist.copy())\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function to find the sublists in a circular list that meet the given criteria.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
