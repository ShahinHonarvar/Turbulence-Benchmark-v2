This function returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -23. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nThe function works by iterating through all possible starting and ending indices of the sublists in the circular list. It checks the product of the integers in each sublist and adds it to the result list if it equals -23. Since the list is circular, the function handles the wrapping around of the indices by using the modulo operator.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= nums[j % n]\n            sublist.append(nums[j % n])\n\n            if product == -23:\n                result.append(sublist.copy())\n\n            if product == 0:\n                break\n\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can now use the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function to find sublists of a circular list where the product of the integers equals -23.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
