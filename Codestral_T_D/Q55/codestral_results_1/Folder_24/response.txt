Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    res = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        prod = 1\n        for j in range(i, n + i):\n            prod *= lst[j % n]\n            if prod == -89:\n                res.append(lst[i:j % n + 1])\n    return res\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all possible sublists of the given list (including those that wrap around to the beginning of the list due to its circular nature) and checking the product of their elements. If the product is -89, the sublist is added to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
