This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists. Each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -33. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -33\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(i+1, i+len(lst)):\n            sublist = lst[i:j]\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can call this function with a circular list of integers to get the desired result.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
