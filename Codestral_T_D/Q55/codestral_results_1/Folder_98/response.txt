Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -1\n    result = []\n    queue = deque()\n    product = 1\n\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        queue.append(lst[i])\n        product *= lst[i]\n\n        while product != n and queue:\n            product /= queue.popleft()\n\n        if product == n:\n            result.append(list(queue))\n\n        if lst[i] == 0:\n            product = 1\n            queue.clear()\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function uses a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of the current sequence of integers. It calculates the product of the integers in the current window and checks if it equals -1. If it does, it adds the current window to the result. The function also handles the case where there's a 0 in the list, as any sequence containing a 0 will have a product of 0, not -1.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
