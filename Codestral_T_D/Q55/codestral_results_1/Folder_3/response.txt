Here's a Python function that should meet your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -22\n    size = len(lst)\n    lst += lst\n    result = []\n    for i in range(size):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, size+i):\n            product *= lst[j]\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(lst[i:j+1])\n            while product % n == 0 and i < j:\n                product //= lst[i]\n                i += 1\n                if product == n:\n                    result.append(lst[i:j+1])\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the circular list and for each element, it multiplies the elements to the right until the product equals -22. If it does, it adds the sublist to the result. It then divides the product by the leftmost element and increases the starting index, repeating this process until the product is no longer divisible by -22. This is done to find all possible sublists that meet the criteria. The list is duplicated to handle the circular nature of the list, and the sublists are found by adjusting the range of the iteration.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
