This function should return a list of sublists where the product of each sublist is equal to -54. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. Duplicates should be included and the order of sublists does not matter.\n\nHere's how I plan to do this:\n1. Create a function 'lists_with_product_equal_n' that takes a list as an argument.\n2. Extend the list to twice its length to account for the circular nature.\n3. Initialize an empty list 'result' to store the required sublists.\n4. Loop through the list and for each element, find all sublists starting from that element such that their product is -54.\n5. Append each such sublist to 'result'.\n6. Return 'result' after the loop finishes.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this.\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    lst *= 2\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, len(lst)):\n            product *= lst[j]\n            if product == -54:\n                result.append(lst[i:j+1])\n    return result\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
