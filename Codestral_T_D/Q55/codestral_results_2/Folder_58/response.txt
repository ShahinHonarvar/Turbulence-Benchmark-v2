The function returns a list of sublists, each of which contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 733. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst += lst\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i+n):\n            product *= lst[j]\n            sublist.append(lst[j])\n            if product == 733 and len(sublist) <= n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n            if product >= 733:\n                break\n\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can call the function with a circular list of integers as an argument to get the desired result.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
