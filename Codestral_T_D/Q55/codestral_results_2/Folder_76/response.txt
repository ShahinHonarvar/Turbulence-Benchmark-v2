This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 247. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = 247\n    results = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, len(lst) + i):\n            sublist.append(lst[j % len(lst)])\n            product *= lst[j % len(lst)]\n            if product == n:\n                results.append(sublist)\n            if product > n:\n                break\n    return results\n```\n\nYou can use the function by calling `lists_with_product_equal_n(your_list)`, where `your_list` is the circular list of integers you want to use as input. The function will return a list of sublists that satisfy the given condition.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
