The function takes a circular list of integers as an argument. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -46. If no such sublist exists, an empty list is returned. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = -46\n    result = []\n    size = len(circular_list)\n    circular_list += circular_list\n\n    for i in range(size):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i+size):\n            product *= circular_list[j]\n            sublist.append(circular_list[j])\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n            if abs(product) > abs(n):\n                break\n\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a circular list of integers as the argument. The function will return a list of sublists that meet the given criteria.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
