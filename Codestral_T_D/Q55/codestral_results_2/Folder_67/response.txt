This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists. Each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 33. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= nums[j % n]\n            sublist.append(nums[j % n])\n            if product == 33:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a circular list of integers as an argument, like so:\n\n```python\nnums = [1, 11, 3, 4, 2, 7]\nresult = lists_with_product_equal_n(nums)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output the list of sublists that meet the criteria, or an empty list if no such sublists exist.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
