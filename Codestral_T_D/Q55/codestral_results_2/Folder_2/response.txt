This function finds all sublists in the given list such that their product equals -968. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. Duplicate sublists are included in the returned list, and the order of sublists does not matter. Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    n = -968\n    size = len(nums)\n    nums = nums + nums\n    result = []\n    for start in range(size):\n        product = 1\n        for end in range(start, start + size):\n            product *= nums[end]\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(nums[start:end + 1])\n            if product == 0:\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a circular list of integers as an argument. It will return a list of sublists that meet the required condition.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
