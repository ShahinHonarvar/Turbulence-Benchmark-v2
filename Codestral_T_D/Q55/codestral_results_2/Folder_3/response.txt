The function will return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -22.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    n = len(lst)\n    lst += lst\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= lst[j]\n            if product == -22:\n                result.append(lst[i:j+1])\n            if product == 0:\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the list and calculating the product of contiguous elements. If the product equals -22, the sublist is added to the result list. The function also handles circular lists by duplicating the list and appending it to the original list. This allows for checking sublists that wrap around from the end to the beginning of the list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
