This function takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists. Each sublist contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -17. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    n = len(lst)\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            product *= lst[j % n]\n            if product == -17:\n                result.append(lst[i:j % n + 1])\n    return result\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `lists_with_product_equal_n` and passing a circular list of integers as an argument.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
