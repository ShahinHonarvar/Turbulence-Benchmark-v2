Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    filtered_string = ''\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        if 19 <= i <= 90 and 'F' <= string[i] <= 'h':\n            filtered_string += string[i]\n    return string.translate(str.maketrans('', '', filtered_string))\n```\n\nThe `filter_chars` function takes one argument, `string`, which is the input string. It iterates over each character in the string and checks if the character's index is within the range of 19 to 90 (both inclusive) and if the character is greater than or equal to 'F' and smaller than or equal to 'h'. If the character meets both conditions, it is added to the `filtered_string`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the input string with all occurrences of characters in the `filtered_string` removed, while preserving the order of all characters in the string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
