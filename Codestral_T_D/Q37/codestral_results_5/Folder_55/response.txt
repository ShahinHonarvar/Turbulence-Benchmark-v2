The function takes a string as input and filters out the characters that occur between indices 1 and 5 (both inclusive) and are greater than or equal to '$' and smaller than or equal to ';'. The function removes all occurrences of these characters from the string while preserving the order of all characters.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    filtered_string = ''\n    for char in string:\n        if not (1 <= string.index(char) <= 5 and '$' <= char <= ';'):\n            filtered_string += char\n    return filtered_string\n```\n\nYou can use the 'filter_chars' function to alter a string as per the specified conditions.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
