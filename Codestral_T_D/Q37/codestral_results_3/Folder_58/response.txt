Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for i in range(503, 754):\n        if '9' <= s[i] <= 'w':\n            s = s.replace(s[i], '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `s` as an argument. It iterates through the characters of the string at indices from 503 to 753 (both inclusive). If a character at a specific index is greater than or equal to '9' and smaller than or equal to 'w', the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string while preserving the order of all characters. Finally, the function returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
