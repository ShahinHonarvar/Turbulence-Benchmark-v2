The function takes one argument, a string. It iterates over each character of the string that occurs between indices 27 and 85 (both inclusive) and is greater than or equal to character \'c\' and smaller than or equal to character \'i\'. For each matching character, the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string while preserving the order of all characters. The function then returns the altered string.\n\nYou can use the `filter_chars` function by calling it and passing a string as an argument, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = filter_chars("your_string_here")\nprint(result)\n```', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
