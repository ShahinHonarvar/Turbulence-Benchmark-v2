Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function takes a string as an argument.\n2. It iterates through the characters of the string that occur between indices 17 and 63, both inclusive.\n3. For each character that is greater than or equal to 'O' and smaller than or equal to '^', the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string while preserving the order of all characters.\n4. The function returns the altered string.\n\nNow, you can use the 'filter_chars' function to filter characters from a string as needed.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
