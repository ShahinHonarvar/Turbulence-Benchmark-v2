You can use this function to filter out characters from a string based on the given conditions. The function takes a single argument, which is the input string. It iterates through the characters of the string between indices 19 and 22 (both inclusive) and checks if the character is greater than or equal to ']' and smaller than or equal to 't'. If the character meets these conditions, it removes all occurrences of that character from the string while preserving the order of all characters.
