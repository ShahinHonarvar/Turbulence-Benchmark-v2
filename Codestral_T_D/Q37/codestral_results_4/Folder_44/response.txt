Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for char in string[21:44]:\n        if '+' <= char <= '8':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```\n\nThe function takes a string as input and iterates over each character between indices 21 and 43 (both inclusive) of the string. If the character is greater than or equal to '+' and smaller than or equal to '8', all occurrences of that character are removed from the string while preserving the order of all other characters. The altered string is then returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
