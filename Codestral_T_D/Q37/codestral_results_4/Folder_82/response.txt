Here's the Python code for it:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for char in set(string[12:26]):\n        if 'P' <= char <= 'x':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```\n\nThe function takes a string as input and iterates through each unique character between indices 12 and 25 (both inclusive). If a character is greater than or equal to 'P' and smaller than or equal to 'x', all occurrences of that character are removed from the string. The altered string is then returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
