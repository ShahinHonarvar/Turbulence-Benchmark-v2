Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for char in s[11:73]:\n        if 'i' <= char <= 'v':\n            s = s.replace(char, '')\n    return s\n```\n\nYou can use the `filter_chars` function to remove specific characters from a string within the given range. The function iterates over each character in the string between indices 11 and 72, checks if the character is between 'i' and 'v' (inclusive), and if so, removes all occurrences of that character from the string. The function then returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
