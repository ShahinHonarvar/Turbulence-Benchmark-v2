This function takes a string as input and iterates through the characters at indices 20 to 62 (both inclusive). For each character in this range that is greater than or equal to 'i' and smaller than or equal to 'k', the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string. The function then returns the modified string. Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for char in string[20:63]:\n        if 'i' <= char <= 'k':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```\n\nYou can now use the `filter_chars` function to modify your strings according to your requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
