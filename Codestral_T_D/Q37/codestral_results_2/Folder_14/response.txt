The function iterates through each character of the given string that occurs between indices 35 and 98, both inclusive. If a character is greater than or equal to 'A' and smaller than or equal to 'b', the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function then returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
