This function iterates over each character of the given string that occurs between indices 29 and 97, inclusive. If a character is greater than or equal to '-' and smaller than or equal to 'n', all occurrences of that character are removed from the string while preserving the order of all characters. The function then returns the altered string.\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for char in s[29:98]:\n        if '-' <= char <= 'n':\n            s = s.replace(char, '')\n    return s\n\n# Testing the function\nfilter_chars('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789')\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
