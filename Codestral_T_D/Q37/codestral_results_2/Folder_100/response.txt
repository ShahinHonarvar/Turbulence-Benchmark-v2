Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for char in s[88:91]:\n        if 'J' <= char <= 'Q':\n            s = s.replace(char, '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThis function takes a string 's' as an argument. It iterates over the characters of the string from indices 88 to 90 (both inclusive). If a character falls between 'J' and 'Q' (inclusive), it removes all occurrences of that character from the string while preserving the order of all characters. Finally, it returns the altered string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
