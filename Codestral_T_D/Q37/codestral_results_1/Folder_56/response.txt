For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 71 and 94, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \'K\' and smaller than or equal to character \'a\', the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function returns the altered string. Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    filtered_string = ""\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        if i >= 71 and i <= 94 and \'K\' <= string[i] <= \'a\':\n            filtered_string += string[i].replace(string[i], "")\n        else:\n            filtered_string += string[i]\n    return filtered_string\n```\n\nYou can call the function \'filter_chars\' with a string argument to use it.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
