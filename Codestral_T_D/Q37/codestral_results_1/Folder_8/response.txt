Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for i in range(41, 87):\n        if 'S' <= s[i] <= 's':\n            s = s.replace(s[i], '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `s` as input and iterates over the characters from index 41 to 86 (both inclusive). If a character falls within the range of 'S' to 's', the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string while preserving the order of the remaining characters. Finally, the altered string is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
