This function will return a list of integers from the 64th index to the 80th index (non-inclusive) that are not divisible by -95. If there are no such integers in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nLet's write and execute the code.\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(num_list):\n    return [num for num in num_list[64:80] if num % -95 != 0]\n```\nThe function 'all_ints_not_div_by_num' has been successfully defined. It takes a list of integers as an argument. The function filters out the numbers from index 64 through 79 that are not divisible by -95 and returns them in a new list. If no such numbers are found, it will return an empty list.\n\nNow you can use this function to get the desired result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
