This function will take a single argument, which is a list of integers. Within the function, I'll use a list comprehension to filter out the elements that are divisible by -88 in the specified range from index 70 to index 98 (exclusive). If there are no such elements, the function will return an empty list. Now, I'll write and execute the Python code for this.\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(int_list):\n    return [i for i in int_list[70:98] if i % -88 != 0]\n```\nI have defined the function 'all_ints_not_div_by_num' as requested. This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list that contains all the integers from index 70 to index 98 (exclusive) that are not divisible by -88. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nYou can now use this function as needed.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
