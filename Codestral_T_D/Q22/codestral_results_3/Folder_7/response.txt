Here's a simple Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    return n * 416 * (416 + 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of the first 416 multiples of the given integer. The formula is `n/2 * (a + l)`, where `n` is the number of terms, `a` is the first term, and `l` is the last term. In this case, `n` is 416, `a` is `n`, and `l` is `416 * n`.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
