Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    return n * sum(range(1, 211))\n```\n\nThis function works by calculating the sum of the first 210 positive integers (which is 211 * 210 / 2) and then multiplying that sum by the given integer 'n'. This is because the sum of the first 'n' multiples of a number 'x' is equal to 'n * x * (n + 1) / 2'. In this case, 'n' is 210 and 'x' is the given integer. However, since we're calculating the sum of the first 210 positive integers first and then multiplying by 'x', the function can be simplified to the code above.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
