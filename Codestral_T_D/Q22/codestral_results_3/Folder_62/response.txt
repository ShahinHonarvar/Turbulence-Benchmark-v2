This function will calculate and return the sum of the first 188 positive multiples of the given integer.\n\nHere's the Python code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(num):\n    return num * sum(range(1, 189))\n```\n\nThis function works by multiplying the input number by the sum of the first 188 positive integers. The sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula n*(n+1)/2, but since we're dealing with 188 integers, we can just use the sum of the range from 1 to 189 (which is inclusive) and multiply it by the input number.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
