This function will calculate the sum of the first 64 positive multiples of the given integer and return the result.\n\nHere is the Python code for this:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    return n * sum(range(1, 65))\n```\n\nThis function works by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of the first 64 multiples of the input number 'n'. The formula is 'n/2 * (first term + last term)', where 'n' is the number of terms, and 'first term' and 'last term' are the first and last terms in the series, respectively. In this case, 'n' is 64, 'first term' is 'n' (because the first multiple of 'n' is 'n'), and 'last term' is '64*n' (because the 64th multiple of 'n' is '64*n'). Therefore, the sum is calculated as '64/2 * (n + 64*n)', which simplifies to 'n * sum(range(1, 65))'.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
