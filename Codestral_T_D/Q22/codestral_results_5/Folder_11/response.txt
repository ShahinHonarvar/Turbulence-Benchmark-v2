The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is `n/2 * (a + l)`, where `n` is the number of terms, `a` is the first term, and `l` is the last term. In this case, `n` is 56, `a` is the given integer, and `l` is 56 times the given integer. Since `a` is a factor of `l`, we can simplify the formula to `n * a * (n + 1) / 2`. However, since `n` is 56, `n + 1` is 57, and 57 is even, we can further simplify the formula to `n * a`.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
