The sum of the first `n` positive integers is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. However, since we need the sum of the first 24 integers, we can simplify it to `n * 24 / 2` which is `n * 12`. Since we are given that `n` is a positive integer, we can further simplify it to `n * 12`.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
