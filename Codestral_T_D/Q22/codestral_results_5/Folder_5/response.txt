Here's a simple Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    return n * sum(range(1, 14))\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the first 13 positive multiples of `n`. It does this by multiplying `n` with the sum of the first 13 positive integers, which is calculated using the `sum(range(1, 14))` expression.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
