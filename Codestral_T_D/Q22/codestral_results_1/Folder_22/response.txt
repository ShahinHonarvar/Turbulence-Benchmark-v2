Here's a simple Python function that should do the trick. It calculates the sum of the first 47 positive multiples of a given positive integer.\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    return n * sum(range(1, 48))\n```\n\nThis function works by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of the first 47 multiples of `n`. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by `n/2 * (a + l)`, where `n` is the number of terms, `a` is the first term, and `l` is the last term. In this case, `n` is 47, `a` is `n` (since `n` is the first multiple), and `l` is `47*n` (since `47*n` is the last multiple). So, the sum of the first 47 multiples of `n` is `47 * (n + 47*n) / 2 = n * sum(range(1, 48))`.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
