Here's a simple Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(num):\n    return num * sum(range(1, 61))\n```\n\nThis function works by calculating the sum of the first 60 positive integers (which is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 60), and then multiplying that sum by the given number. This is equivalent to calculating the sum of the first 60 multiples of the given number.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
