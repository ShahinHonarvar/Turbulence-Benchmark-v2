Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function takes a list of strings as an argument.\n2. It initializes an empty dictionary to store the sorted strings as keys and their counts as values.\n3. It iterates over each string in the input list.\n4. If the length of the string is less than three, it skips to the next string.\n5. It sorts the characters in the string (in a case-insensitive manner) and joins them to create a sorted string.\n6. It checks if the sorted string is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of that key by 1. If it is not, it adds the sorted string as a new key to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n7. After iterating over all the strings, it calculates the number of anagram pairs using the formula `count * (count - 1) // 2` for each key in the dictionary.\n8. It sums up the number of anagram pairs for all keys.\n9. If the total number of anagram pairs is greater than or equal to 25, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nYou can use this function to check if a given list of strings contains at least 25 pairs of anagrams (with a length of at least three).", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
