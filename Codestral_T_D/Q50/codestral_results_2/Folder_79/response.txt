The function will return True if there are at least 40 pairs of anagrams in the given list, where the anagrams are of a length of at least three, and the comparison is case-insensitive. The function will use a dictionary to store the sorted strings as keys and their frequencies as values. Then, it will iterate through the frequencies and count the number of pairs that have a frequency of at least 2, which means they are anagrams. If the count is greater than or equal to 40, the function will return True; otherwise, it will return False.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements the function:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(strings):\n    anagram_count = 0\n    anagram_dict = {}\n\n    for string in strings:\n        sorted_string = ''.join(sorted(string.lower()))\n\n        if len(sorted_string) < 3:\n            continue\n\n        if sorted_string in anagram_dict:\n            anagram_dict[sorted_string] += 1\n        else:\n            anagram_dict[sorted_string] = 1\n\n    for frequency in anagram_dict.values():\n        anagram_count += frequency * (frequency - 1) // 2\n\n    return anagram_count >= 40\n```\n\nYou can call the function with a list of strings to check if it contains at least 40 pairs of anagrams of length at least three.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
