This function will take a single argument, which is a list of strings. The function will return True if there are at least 44 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it will return False. The function will only consider anagrams of a length of at least three. The function will compare strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nTo solve this problem, I'll use the collections.Counter function to count the occurrence of each character in each string and map this counter to a list of strings. If two strings have the same character count, they are anagrams of each other. I'll count these pairs and return True if the count is greater than or equal to 44. Otherwise, I'll return False.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this function.\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef if_contains_anagrams(lst):\n    anagram_counts = {}\n    for word in lst:\n        if len(word) >= 3:\n            sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word.lower()))\n            if sorted_word in anagram_counts:\n                anagram_counts[sorted_word] += 1\n            else:\n                anagram_counts[sorted_word] = 1\n    anagram_pairs = sum(count * (count - 1) // 2 for count in anagram_counts.values())\n    return anagram_pairs >= 44\n```\nThe Python function 'if_contains_anagrams' has been successfully defined. This function takes a list of strings as an argument and returns True if there are at least 44 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it returns False. The function only considers anagrams of a length of at least three and compares strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nYou can now use this function to check a list of strings for the presence of at least 44 pairs of anagrams.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
