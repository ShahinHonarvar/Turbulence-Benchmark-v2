This function will take a list of strings as input and return True if there are at least 10^6 pairs of anagrams in the list, where an anagram is defined as a different arrangement of the same characters and the length of the anagram should be at least three. The function will compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nLet's write the code:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(strings):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for string in strings:\n        if len(string) < 3:\n            continue\n        sorted_string = ''.join(sorted(string.lower()))\n        anagram_groups[sorted_string].append(string)\n\n    for group in anagram_groups.values():\n        if len(group) >= 2:\n            if len(group) * (len(group) - 1) / 2 >= 10**6:\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\nThis function first creates a dictionary to group the anagrams together. It sorts the characters in each string and uses the sorted string as a key in the dictionary. If the length of a string is less than three, it is not considered for anagrams. The function then checks if there are at least two strings in any group, as this would indicate the presence of at least one pair of anagrams. It calculates the number of pairs in each group and checks if it is greater than or equal to 10^6. If so, the function returns True. If no such group is found, the function returns False.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
