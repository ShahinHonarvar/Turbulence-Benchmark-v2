If a word has at least three characters, it is added to the corresponding group. After that, it calculates the number of pairs in each group and sums them up. If the total number of pairs is at least 38, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
