This function takes a string of distinct characters as an argument. It filters the characters that occur between indices 17 to 86 (both inclusive), sorts them based on their ASCII values, and then returns the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it and passing a string as an argument, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = return_nth_smallest_ascii("your_string_here")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nReplace `"your_string_here"` with your desired input string. The function will return the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value among the characters at the specified indices in the input string.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
