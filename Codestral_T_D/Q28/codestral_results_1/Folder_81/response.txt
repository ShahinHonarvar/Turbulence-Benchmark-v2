This function will return the character with the 14th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 0 to 13. Here's how I'll do it:\n\n1. I'll slice the string to contain only the characters between indices 0 to 13.\n2. I'll sort this sliced string to arrange the characters in ascending order of their ASCII values.\n3. I'll return the character at the 14th position (considering Python's 0-based indexing).\n\nNow, I'll write and execute the Python code.\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    return sorted(s[0:14])[13]\n\n# Testing the function with a sample input\nprint(return_nth_smallest_ascii('abcdefghijklmnop'))\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
