This function takes a string of distinct characters as input and returns the character with the 9th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 51 to 78.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    # filter characters between indices 51 to 78\n    filtered_chars = s[51:79]\n    # sort characters based on ASCII value\n    sorted_chars = sorted(filtered_chars, key=ord)\n    # return the character with the 9th smallest ASCII value\n    return sorted_chars[8]\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a string as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = return_nth_smallest_ascii("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe output will be the character with the 9th smallest ASCII value among the characters between indices 51 to 78 in the provided string.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
