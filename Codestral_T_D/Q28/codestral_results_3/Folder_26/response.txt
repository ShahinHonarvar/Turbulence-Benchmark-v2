Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    # Consider only the characters from index 1 to 36 (both inclusive)\n    sub_s = s[1:37]\n\n    # Convert the characters to their ASCII values and sort them\n    ascii_values = sorted(ord(c) for c in sub_s)\n\n    # Return the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value\n    return chr(ascii_values[14])\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the relevant substring from the input string. It then converts each character in this substring to its ASCII value using the `ord` function, sorts these values, and returns the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value using the `chr` function. Note that I'm using 14 as the index since Python uses 0-based indexing.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
