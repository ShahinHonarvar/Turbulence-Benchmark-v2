This function will return the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 28 to 67, both inclusive.\n\nThe steps I will take to accomplish this are:\n\n1. Slice the string to get the characters between indices 28 and 67.\n2. Sort the sliced string to get the characters in ascending order of their ASCII values.\n3. Return the character at the 14th index (since Python indexing starts from 0) in the sorted string, which is the 15th smallest ASCII value according to the problem statement.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement this:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    sorted_string = sorted(string[28:68])\n    return sorted_string[14]\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
