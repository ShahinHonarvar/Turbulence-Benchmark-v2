The function will extract the characters between indices 1 to 46 (both inclusive) and find the character with the 13th smallest ASCII value among these characters.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    characters = string[1:47]\n    sorted_chars = sorted(characters, key=ord)\n    return sorted_chars[12]\n```\n\nThe `return_nth_smallest_ascii` function takes a `string` as input. It extracts the characters between indices 1 to 46 (both inclusive) using string slicing and stores them in the `characters` variable.\n\nNext, the `sorted` function is called with `characters` as the iterable and `key=ord` as the argument. The `ord` function is used to convert each character to its corresponding ASCII value. The `sorted` function returns a new list of characters sorted in ascending order of their ASCII values.\n\nFinally, the function returns the character at the 13th index (0-based) of the sorted list, which is the character with the 13th smallest ASCII value among the extracted characters.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
