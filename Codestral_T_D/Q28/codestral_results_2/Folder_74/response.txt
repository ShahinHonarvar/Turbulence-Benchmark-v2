This function takes a string of distinct characters as an argument. It then returns the character with the 6th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 1 to 31, both inclusive. Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    chars = sorted(s[1:32])\n    return chars[5]\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `return_nth_smallest_ascii(string)` and passing a string as the argument.
