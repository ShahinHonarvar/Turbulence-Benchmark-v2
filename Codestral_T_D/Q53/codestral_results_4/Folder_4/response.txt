The palindromes should only consist of English letters and the function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):\n    import re\n    s = s.lower()\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', s)\n    return {word for word in words if word == word[::-1] and len(word) >= 99 and word.isalpha()}\n```\n\nThis function first converts the input string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison. It then uses the 're.findall' function to extract all words from the string. It defines a word as a sequence of alphanumeric characters or underscores that is surrounded by word boundaries (\\b).\n\nThe function then uses a set comprehension to generate a set of all words that are palindromes, have a length of at least 99, and consist only of English letters. A word is considered a palindrome if it is equal to its reverse (word == word[::-1]).\n\nFinally, the function returns the set of palindromes.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
