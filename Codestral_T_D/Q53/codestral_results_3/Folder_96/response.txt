The function should only consider palindromes that consist of English letters and should be case-insensitive. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set.\n\nI will write the Python code to implement this function according to the given requirements.\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    length = len(s)\n\n    for i in range(length):\n        for j in range(i + 24, length + 1):\n            substring = s[i:j]\n            if substring.lower() == substring.lower()[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\nI have implemented the `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` function according to the given requirements. Here's a brief explanation of how the function works:\n\n- It takes a string `s` as input.\n- It initializes an empty set `palindromes` to store the palindromes that meet the criteria.\n- It iterates over all possible substrings of `s` with a length greater than or equal to 24.\n- For each substring, it checks if the lowercase version of the substring is equal to its reverse.\n- If the substring is a palindrome, it adds it to the `palindromes` set.\n- Finally, it returns the `palindromes` set.\n\nYou can now use this function to find all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 24 in a given string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
