Here's a breakdown of the function:\n\n1. The function takes one argument, a string.\n2. It initializes an empty set to store the palindromes.\n3. It filters out all non-alphanumeric characters from the string and converts the remaining characters to lowercase.\n4. It then iterates over each possible length of palindromes starting from 95 up to the length of the string.\n5. For each length, it checks each possible substring of that length to see if it is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards).\n6. If a substring is a palindrome, it adds it to the set of palindromes.\n7. After checking all possible substrings, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nIf no palindromes of length at least 95 are found in the string, the function will return an empty set.\n\nThe code for the function is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):\n    s = ''.join(c.lower() for c in s if c.isalpha())\n    return set(s[i:i+l] for i in range(len(s)) for l in range(95, len(s)-i+1) if s[i:i+l] == s[i:i+l][::-1])\n```\n\nYou can now use this function to find all palindromes of length at least 95 in a given string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
