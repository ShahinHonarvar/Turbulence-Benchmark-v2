Here's the Python code that implements the function 'palindrome_of_length_at_least_n' as per your specifications:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):\n    s = s.lower()\n    n = 84\n    palindromes = set()\n\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        for j in range(i + n, len(s) + 1):\n            substring = s[i:j]\n            if substring == substring[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as input, converts it to lowercase, and then iterates over all possible substrings of the string. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome (i.e., equal to its reverse) and if its length is greater than or equal to 84. If both conditions are satisfied, the substring is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes as the result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
