Here's a brief explanation of the function:\n\nThe function 'palindrome_of_length_at_least_n' takes a single argument, a string. It first filters out all substrings of the given string that are at least 64 characters long and consist only of English letters. This is done using a list comprehension and the 'isalpha()' function.\n\nNext, the function checks each of these substrings to see if they are palindromes. A string is considered a palindrome if it is equal to its reverse, and the function checks this by converting the string to lower case and comparing it to its reverse, also in lower case.\n\nFinally, the function returns a set of all the palindromic substrings that meet the length requirement. If no such substrings exist, the function returns an empty set.\n\nNow, let's see the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):\n    return {sub for sub in [s[i: j] for i in range(len(s)) for j in range(i + 64, len(s) + 1) if sub.isalpha()] if sub.lower() == sub.lower()[::-1]}\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
