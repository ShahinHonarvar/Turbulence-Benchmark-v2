The function converts the string to lowercase and then iterates through all possible substrings of length greater than or equal to 78. For each substring, it checks if the substring is equal to its reverse and if it consists only of English letters. If both conditions are satisfied, the substring is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the set of palindromes is returned by the function.\n\nThe function finds palindromes in a case-insensitive manner by converting the string to lowercase before checking for palindromes.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
