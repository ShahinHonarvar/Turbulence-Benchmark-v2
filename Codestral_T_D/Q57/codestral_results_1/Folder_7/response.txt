Here's a Python function that uses numpy to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    submatrices = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i, rows):\n                for l in range(j, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if submatrix.sum() == -128:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nThis function iterates over all possible submatrices of the input matrix and checks if their sum equals -128. If it does, the submatrix is added to the list of results. The function returns this list.\n\nPlease note that this function has a time complexity of O(n^4), where n is the number of elements in the matrix. This is because it checks the sum of every possible submatrix, and there are n^2 possible submatrices for a matrix of size n x n. If the matrix is large, this function may take a long time to execute.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
