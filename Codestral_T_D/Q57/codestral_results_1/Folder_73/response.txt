It initializes an empty list called `submatrices` to store the submatrices that meet the condition.\n\nThe code then iterates through all possible submatrix sizes, where `r` represents the number of rows and `c` represents the number of columns in the submatrix. For each submatrix size, it iterates through all possible starting positions of the submatrix within the given matrix.\n\nAt each starting position, the code extracts the submatrix from the given matrix and checks if the sum of all integers in the submatrix equals 93. If it does, the submatrix is appended to the `submatrices` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `submatrices` list, which contains all the submatrices that meet the condition. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
