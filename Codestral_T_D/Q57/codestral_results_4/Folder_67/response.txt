The function should return a list of all submatrices in the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 40. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.\n\nThe function can be implemented using a nested loop to generate all possible submatrices of the given matrix and then checking if the sum of integers in each submatrix equals 40. If it does, the submatrix is added to the list of results.\n\nHere's the Python code for the 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    result = []\n\n    for start_row in range(rows):\n        for start_col in range(cols):\n            for end_row in range(start_row, rows):\n                for end_col in range(start_col, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[start_row:end_row+1, start_col:end_col+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == 40:\n                        result.append(submatrix)\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThe code imports the Numpy library and defines the 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' function. Inside the function, the shape of the input matrix is obtained using the 'shape' attribute, and the variables 'rows' and 'cols' are assigned the number of rows and columns, respectively.\n\nThe function then iterates over all possible submatrices of the given matrix using four nested loops. The 'start_row', 'start_col', 'end_row', and 'end_col' variables are used to define the boundaries of each submatrix.\n\nFor each submatrix, its sum is calculated using the 'np.sum' function. If the sum equals 40, the submatrix is appended to the 'result' list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the 'result' list containing all submatrices with a sum of 40. If no such submatrix is found, an empty list is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
