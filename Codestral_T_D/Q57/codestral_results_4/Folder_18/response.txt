The function returns a list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 616. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return an empty list. I've used nested loops to iterate through all possible submatrices and calculated their sums. If the sum equals 616, the submatrix was added to the result list. Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    result = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i+1, rows+1):\n                for l in range(j+1, cols+1):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k, j:l]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == 616:\n                        result.append(submatrix)\n    return result\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
