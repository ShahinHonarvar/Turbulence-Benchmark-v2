Here is how I would implement this function using Python and numpy:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    submatrices = []\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i, rows):\n                for l in range(j, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if submatrix.sum() == 3:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nThis function goes through all possible submatrices in the given matrix and checks whether their sum is equal to 3. If it is, the submatrix is added to the list of submatrices that will be returned at the end of the function. The list is empty if no such submatrix is found.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
