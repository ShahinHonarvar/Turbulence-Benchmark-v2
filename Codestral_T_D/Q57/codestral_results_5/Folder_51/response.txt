Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for. I'll use the numpy library to handle the two-dimensional matrix and to calculate the sum of the submatrices efficiently. I'll define a function that generates all possible submatrices of the given matrix and checks their sum. If the sum is equal to -46, the submatrix is added to the result list. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    result = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i, rows):\n                for l in range(j, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == -46:\n                        result.append(submatrix)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function uses four nested loops to generate all possible submatrices of the input matrix. For each submatrix, it checks if the sum of its elements is equal to -46. If it is, the submatrix is added to the result list. Finally, the function returns the list of all submatrices that meet the condition.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
