This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument. It iterates over all possible submatrices of the input matrix and checks if the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 88. If a submatrix with the desired sum is found, it's added to the results list. The function finally returns this list; if no such submatrix exists, it returns an empty list.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the function:\n\n1. It initializes an empty list `results` to store the submatrices that meet the condition.\n2. It uses nested loops to iterate over all possible submatrices of the input matrix. This is done by defining the top-left and bottom-right coordinates of each submatrix and then using these coordinates to slice the input matrix.\n3. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum of all its elements using the numpy `sum` function.\n4. If the sum equals 88, the submatrix is added to the `results` list.\n5. After checking all submatrices, the function returns the `results` list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
