Here is a Python function that uses numpy to solve the problem. It checks all possible submatrices of the input matrix and returns a list of those that sum to -97.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    submatrices = []\n\n    for r1 in range(rows):\n        for c1 in range(cols):\n            for r2 in range(r1, rows):\n                for c2 in range(c1, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[r1:r2+1, c1:c2+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == -97:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nThis function iterates over all possible submatrices of the input matrix. For each submatrix, it computes the sum of its elements and checks if it equals -97. If it does, the submatrix is added to the list of submatrices that is returned by the function. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
