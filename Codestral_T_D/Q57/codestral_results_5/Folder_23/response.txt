This function will take a two-dimensional Numpy matrix of integers as an argument. It will iterate over all possible submatrices of the given matrix and check if the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 59. If such submatrices are found, they will be added to a list, which will be returned by the function. If no such submatrices are found, the function will return an empty list.\n\nNow, I will write and execute the Python code.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    submatrices = []\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i, rows):\n                for l in range(j, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if submatrix.sum() == 59:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\nThe function 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' has been successfully defined.
