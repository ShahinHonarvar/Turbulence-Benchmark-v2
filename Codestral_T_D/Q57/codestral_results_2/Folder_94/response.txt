It calculates all possible submatrices from the given matrix and checks if the sum of all the integers in each submatrix equals 92. If a submatrix with the particular sum is found, it is added to a list. Finally, the function returns the list of all submatrices with the particular sum. If no such submatrix is found, an empty list is returned.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    submatrices = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            for i in range(r, rows):\n                for j in range(c, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[r:i+1, c:j+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == 92:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix)`, where `matrix` is a two-dimensional NumPy matrix of integers.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
