This function will go through all possible submatrices of the given matrix and check if the sum of their elements equals -43. If it does, the submatrix will be added to a list. Finally, the function will return this list. If no submatrix meets the condition, an empty list will be returned.\n\nLet's write and execute the Python code for this.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    submatrices = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i+1, rows+1):\n                for l in range(j+1, cols+1):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k, j:l]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == -43:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\nThe Python function 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' has been created successfully. This function takes a 2D numpy array as input and returns a list of all submatrices in the input matrix for which the sum of the elements is -43. If no such submatrix is found, it returns an empty list. Now, you can use this function to find the required submatrices in a given 2D numpy array.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
