It makes use of the numpy library for efficient matrix operations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    submatrices = []\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            for r in range(row, rows):\n                for c in range(col, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[row:r+1, col:c+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == -25:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nThis function works by looping through all possible submatrices of the given matrix, checking if their sum equals -25. If a submatrix meets this condition, it is added to the list of submatrices that is returned at the end of the function.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
