This function should accept 321 unique arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set that contains all the given sets as subsets.\n\nHere is how I plan to implement this:\n1. Start by defining the function 'find_original_set' that takes 321 arguments.\n2. Inside the function, create an empty set to store the union of all the input sets.\n3. Iterate over each set in the arguments and update the union set with the union of the current set and the union set.\n4. Finally, return the union set which is the smallest set that contains all the given sets as subsets.\n\nI will now proceed to write and execute the Python code.\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    union_set = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        union_set.update(s)\n    return union_set\n```\nThe Python function 'find_original_set' has been successfully defined. It takes a variable number of sets as arguments and returns a set that is the union of all the input sets. This union set is the smallest set that contains all the given sets as subsets. You can now use this function to find the original set.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
