This function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nHere's the Python code to define the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set.union(*args)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `union` method of the set data type to find the union of all the sets passed as arguments, effectively combining all the unique elements into a single set. Since each input set is a subset of the combined set, this function successfully meets your requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
