Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set.union(*args)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `union` method of the `set` class to combine all the sets that are passed as arguments into one set. Since `union` returns a set that contains all elements that are in any of the input sets, this will give us the smallest set that contains all the given sets as subsets.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
