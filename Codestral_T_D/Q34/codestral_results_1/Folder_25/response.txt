Here's a simple Python function that should do the trick:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set.union(*args)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `union` method of the `set` class to combine all of the sets that are passed as arguments. Since the `union` method returns a new set that contains all elements that are in any of the input sets, this will give us the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
