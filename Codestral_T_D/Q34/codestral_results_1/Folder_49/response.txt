The function will return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it. To achieve this, I will initialize an empty set and then iterate through each argument set, updating the result set by performing a union operation. This will ensure that all elements from all argument sets are included in the result set, while also preserving the property that each argument set is a subset of the result set.\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    result = set()\n    for s in args:\n        result |= s\n    return result\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
