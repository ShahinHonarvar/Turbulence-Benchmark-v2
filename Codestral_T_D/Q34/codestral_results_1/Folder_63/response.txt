This function takes 18 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function returns the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with 18 distinct sets of integers as arguments. Here is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nset1 = {1, 2, 3}\nset2 = {2, 3, 4}\nset3 = {3, 4, 5}\n# Add 15 more sets of integers here\n\noriginal_set = find_original_set(set1, set2, set3, ...)  # Replace ... with the remaining 15 sets\nprint(original_set)\n```\n\nReplace `set1`, `set2`, `set3`, and the remaining 15 sets with your own set of integers. The function will return the smallest set that includes all the given sets as its subsets.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
