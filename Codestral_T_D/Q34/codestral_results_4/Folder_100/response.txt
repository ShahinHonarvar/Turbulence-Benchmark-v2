Here's what it does:\n\n- It takes 91 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n- It initializes an empty set called `result_set`.\n- It iterates over each set in the arguments and updates `result_set` by performing a union operation with the current set.\n- Finally, it returns `result_set` which is the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nYou can use this function to find the smallest set that contains all the given sets as its subsets. Just pass the 91 distinct sets as arguments to the function.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
