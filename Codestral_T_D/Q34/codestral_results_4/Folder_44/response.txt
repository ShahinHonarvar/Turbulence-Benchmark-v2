This function takes exactly 926 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. It returns the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nThe function uses the set union operation to combine all the sets into one, effectively finding the smallest set that contains all the elements from all the given sets.\n\nHere's the Python code for the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set.union(*args)\n```\n\nYou can now use the `find_original_set` function to find the smallest set that contains all the given sets as subsets.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
