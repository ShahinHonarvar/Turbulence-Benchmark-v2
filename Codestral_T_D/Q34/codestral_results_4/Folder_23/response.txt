The `*` operator is used to unpack the arguments, which means that the function can take any number of arguments. The `union` method returns a new set that contains all elements from all the input sets.\n\nSince each input set is a subset of the union of all sets, the function returns the smallest set that meets the requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
