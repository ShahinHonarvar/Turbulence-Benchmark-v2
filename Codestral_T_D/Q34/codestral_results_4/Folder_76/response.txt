Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set.union(*args)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `set.union(*args)` method, which returns a new set with elements from all of the input sets. Since each argument is required to be a set of integers, and since the union of any sets is a superset of each of the original sets, this function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
