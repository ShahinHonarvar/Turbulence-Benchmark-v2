The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set.union(*args)\n```\n\nThis function uses the union method of the set class to combine all the given sets into one. Since a union of sets always results in a set that contains all elements from all sets, and since each of the given arguments is a subset of the resulting set, this function meets the requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
