This function finds the smallest set that is a superset of all the given sets and returns it.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It initializes an empty set called `superset` to store the elements of all the input sets.\n2. It iterates over each set in `*sets` (which represents all the input sets).\n3. For each set, it updates the `superset` by performing a union operation with the current set.\n4. Finally, it returns the `superset`, which contains all the elements from all the input sets.\n\nYou can now use this function to find the smallest superset of multiple sets.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
