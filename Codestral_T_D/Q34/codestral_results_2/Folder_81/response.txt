You want me to create a Python function named 'find_original_set' that accepts 72 distinct sets as arguments. This function will return the smallest set such that each of the given sets is a subset of it.\n\nLet's write the function according to the specification. The function will use the union operation to combine all the sets into one, ensuring no duplicates are included since sets in Python automatically remove duplicate elements. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Define the function 'find_original_set'.\n2. Initialize an empty set to store the union of all sets.\n3. Iterate over all the arguments and use the union operation to combine them into the initial set.\n4. Return the final set.\n\nNow, I'll write the Python code for this.\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set().union(*args)\n```\nThe Python function 'find_original_set' has been successfully defined. This function takes a variable number of arguments, each being a set of integers. It uses the union operation to combine all the sets into one, ensuring no duplicates are included. The function then returns this combined set.\n\nYou can now use this function to find the smallest set that includes all the given sets as its subsets.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
