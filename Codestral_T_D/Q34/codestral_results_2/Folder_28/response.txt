Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for. It takes 43 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers, and returns the smallest set that contains all of the given sets as subsets.\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set.union(*args)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `union` method of the `set` class to combine all of the given sets into a single set. Since `union` returns a set that contains all elements that are in either set, this will ensure that each of the given sets is a subset of the returned set. The `*args` syntax allows the function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
