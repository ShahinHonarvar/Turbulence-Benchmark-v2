The function will return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nTo accomplish this, I will use the union operation to combine all the sets into one. The union operation will ensure that all unique elements from all sets are included in the final set. This final set will be the smallest set that satisfies the condition that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(set1, set2, set3, set4, set5, set6, set7):\n    return set1.union(set2, set3, set4, set5, set6, set7)\n```\n\nYou can call the function 'find_original_set' with seven distinct sets of integers as arguments to get the desired result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
