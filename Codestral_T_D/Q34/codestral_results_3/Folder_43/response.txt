This function will return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nTo solve this, I will use the union operation of sets to merge all the sets into one. Since all the sets are distinct, there won't be any duplicate elements, and the resulting set will be the smallest one that contains all the elements from all the sets.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(set1, set2, set3, set4, set5, set6, set7, set8, set9,\n                      set10, set11, set12, set13, set14, set15, set16, set17, set18, set19,\n                      set20, set21, set22, set23, set24, set25, set26, set27, set28, set29,\n                      set30, set31, set32, set33, set34, set35, set36, set37, set38, set39,\n                      set40, set41, set42, set43, set44, set45, set46, set47, set48, set49):\n    return set1.union(set2, set3, set4, set5, set6, set7, set8, set9, set10,\n                      set11, set12, set13, set14, set15, set16, set17, set18, set19,\n                      set20, set21, set22, set23, set24, set25, set26, set27, set28, set29,\n                      set30, set31, set32, set33, set34, set35, set36, set37, set38, set39,\n                      set40, set41, set42, set43, set44, set45, set46, set47, set48, set49)\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
