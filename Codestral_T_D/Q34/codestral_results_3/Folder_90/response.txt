The union of all the sets will ensure that each of the given sets is a subset of the resultant set. Finding the smallest set will mean that the resultant set has the minimum number of elements, which can be achieved by the union operation as well.\n\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set().union(*args)\n```\n\nThis function takes any number of set arguments and returns the union of all those sets.
