Here's a simple Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set().union(*args)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `union` method of the set class to combine all of the input sets into one. Since the input sets are all distinct, the resulting set will contain all unique elements from all of the input sets. This set will be the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it, as it contains exactly the elements that are needed to include all of the input sets.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
