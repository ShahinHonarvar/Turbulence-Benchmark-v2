Define a helper function 'is_prime' to check if a number is prime.\n2. Define the main function 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument.\n3. Extract the integer at index 803 from the tuple.\n4. Initialize an empty list to store the right-truncatable prime numbers.\n5. Iterate through all numbers less than the extracted integer.\n6. For each number, check if it's prime and if all of its right-truncations are also prime.\n7. If the number meets both conditions, append it to the list.\n8. Sort the list in ascending order and return it.\n\nLet me write the code for you.\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(t):\n    x = t[803]\n    result = []\n    for num in range(2, x):\n        if is_prime(num):\n            truncated = num\n            while truncated > 0:\n                if not is_prime(truncated):\n                    break\n                truncated = truncated // 10\n            else:\n                result.append(num)\n    result.sort()\n    return result\n```\nI have written the Python code according to your text specification. The code includes a helper function 'is_prime' to check if a number is prime, and the main function 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument.\n\nThe function extracts the integer at index 803 from the tuple. It then iterates through all numbers less than the extracted integer, checking if each number is prime and if all of its right-truncations are also prime. If a number meets both conditions, it is appended to a list.\n\nFinally, the list is sorted in ascending order and returned. If there are no such right-truncatable prime numbers, the function returns an empty list.\n\nYou can use this function to find all right-truncatable prime numbers less than a specific integer.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
