If there's no such an element, it returns 'None'. The function first checks if the length of the list is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns 'None'. Then, it iterates through the first five elements of the list and updates the smallest and second smallest numbers accordingly. Finally, it returns 'None' if the second smallest number is still equal to 'inf', meaning that no second smallest number was found. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest number.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
