The function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 15 to index 39, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function will return 'None'.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n    if len(nums) < 40:\n        return None\n    sublist = nums[15:40]\n    sublist.sort()\n    if len(sublist) < 2:\n        return None\n    return sublist[1]\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a list of numbers as the argument. For example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]\nsecond_smallest = find_second_smallest_num(numbers)\nprint(second_smallest)\n```\n\nThis will output the second smallest number from index 15 to index 39 of the `numbers` list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
