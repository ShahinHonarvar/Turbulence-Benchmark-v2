If there is no such an element, the function should return 'None'.\n\nHere is a Python function that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(numbers):\n    # Extract the relevant portion of the list\n    sublist = numbers[20:31]\n    # If the sublist has less than 2 elements, return None\n    if len(sublist) < 2:\n        return None\n    # Sort the sublist and return the second element\n    return sorted(sublist)[1]\n```\n\nIn this function, we first slice the input list to get the relevant portion. If this sublist has less than 2 elements, we return 'None' immediately. Otherwise, we sort the sublist in ascending order and return the second element (which is at index 1 after sorting).", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
