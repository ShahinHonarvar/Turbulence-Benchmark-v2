This function will iterate over the elements of the list from index 28 to index 40 (both inclusive) and calculate the sum of all odd numbers in this range. If no odd numbers are found in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nLet's write and execute the code now.\n```python\ndef sum_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return sum(x for x in lst[28:41] if x % 2 != 0)\n```\nThe function 'sum_odd_ints_inclusive' has been successfully defined. This function will take a list of integers as input, and it will return the sum of all odd integers from index 28 to index 40 (both inclusive).
