Here's a Python function that meets your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    return sum(i for i in range(1, 9) if n % i == 0)\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as its argument. It then uses a generator expression to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 8 (inclusive), and checks if `n` is divisible by each number in the range. If `n` is divisible by a number, that number is added to the sum. Finally, the function returns the sum of all the numbers that `n` is divisible by in the range from 1 to 8. If no such numbers exist, the function will return 0.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
