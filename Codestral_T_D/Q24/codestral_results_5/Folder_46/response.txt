This function takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 81 and 88, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(81, 89) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_of_divisors_in_range(100)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is called with 100 as the argument. The output will be the sum of all positive divisors of 100 that are between 81 and 88, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist, the output will be 0.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
