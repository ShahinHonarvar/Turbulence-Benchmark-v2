If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors_sum = 0\n    for i in range(15, 93):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors_sum += i\n    return divisors_sum\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as its argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_of_divisors_in_range(100)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will print the sum of all positive divisors of 100 that are between 15 and 92.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
