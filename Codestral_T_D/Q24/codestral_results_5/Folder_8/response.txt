This function will find all the positive divisors of the given integer that are between 48 and 62, both inclusive. It will then sum up these divisors and return the result. If there are no divisors in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(48, 63) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `sum_of_divisors_in_range` which takes one argument `n`. It uses a list comprehension to generate a list of all integers `i` between 48 and 62 (inclusive) for which `n` is divisible by `i`. The `sum` function is then used to calculate the sum of these divisors, which is returned by the function.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
