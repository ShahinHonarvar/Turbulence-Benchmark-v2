The function is called 'sum_of_divisors_in_range' and it takes a positive integer as its argument. The function calculates the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 2 and 5 (both inclusive). If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0. Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(2, 6) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it and passing a positive integer as an argument. For example, `sum_of_divisors_in_range(12)` will return the sum of all divisors of 12 that are between 2 and 5.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
