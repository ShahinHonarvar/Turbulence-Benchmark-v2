The function returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 35 and 55, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return 0. Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors_sum = 0\n    for i in range(35, 56):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors_sum += i\n    return divisors_sum\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_of_divisors_in_range(100)\nprint(result)  # Output: 55\n```\n\nIn this example, the function is called with the argument 100. The divisors of 100 that are between 35 and 55 are 50 and 25. The sum of these divisors is 50 + 25 = 75, so the function will return 75.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
