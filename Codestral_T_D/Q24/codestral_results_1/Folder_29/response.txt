If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return 0. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors_sum = 0\n    for i in range(43, 78):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors_sum += i\n    return divisors_sum\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(sum_of_divisors_in_range(100))\n```\n\nThis will output the sum of all positive divisors of 100 that are between 43 and 77, inclusive.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
