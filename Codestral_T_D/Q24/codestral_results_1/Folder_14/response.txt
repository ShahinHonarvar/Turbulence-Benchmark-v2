This function takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 6 and 8, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(6, 9) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_of_divisors_in_range(24)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n12\n```\n\nSince 24 is divisible by 6 and 8, which are both within the range of 6 to 8 (inclusive), the sum of these divisors is 12.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
