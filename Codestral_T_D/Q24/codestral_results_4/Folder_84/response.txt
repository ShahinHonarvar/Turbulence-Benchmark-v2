If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0. Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(224, 585) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_of_divisors_in_range(1000)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will calculate the sum of all positive divisors of 1000 that are between 224 and 584 and print the result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
