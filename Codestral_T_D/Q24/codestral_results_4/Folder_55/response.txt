The function takes a positive integer as an argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 5 and 8, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(5, 9) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_of_divisors_in_range(24)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n8\n```\n\nIn this example, the positive divisors of 24 that are between 5 and 8 are 8 and 6. The sum of these divisors is 8, which is the output of the function.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
