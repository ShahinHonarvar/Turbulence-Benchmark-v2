If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return 0. Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(70, 94) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a positive integer as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_of_divisors_in_range(100)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will calculate the sum of all positive divisors of 100 that are between 70 and 93 and print the result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
