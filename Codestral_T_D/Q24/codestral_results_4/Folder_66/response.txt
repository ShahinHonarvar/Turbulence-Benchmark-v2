This function takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 32 and 35, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nHere's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(32, 36) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as an argument, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_of_divisors_in_range(120)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function will return the sum of all positive divisors of 120 that are between 32 and 35, which is 32 in this case.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
