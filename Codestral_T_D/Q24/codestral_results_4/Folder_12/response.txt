It then iterates over the range from 13 to 62 (or 'n', whichever is smaller), and for each number 'i' in this range, it checks if 'n' is divisible by 'i'. If 'n' is divisible by 'i', 'i' is added to the sum. Finally, the sum of all these numbers is returned. If no such numbers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0, as no numbers were added to the sum.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
