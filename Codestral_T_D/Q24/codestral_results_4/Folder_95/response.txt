If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(35, 99):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_of_divisors_in_range(100)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will calculate and print the sum of all divisors of 100 that are between 35 and 98.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
