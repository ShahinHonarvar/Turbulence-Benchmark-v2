The function takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 15 and 20, inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(15, 21) if n % i == 0]\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_of_divisors_in_range(50)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will calculate the sum of all positive divisors of 50 that are between 15 and 20, inclusive, and print the result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
