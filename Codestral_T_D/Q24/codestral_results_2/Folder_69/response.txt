If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0]\n    sum_divisors = sum([i for i in divisors if i >= 658 and i <= 868])\n    return sum_divisors\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a positive integer as the argument. For example, `sum_of_divisors_in_range(1000)` will return the sum of all positive divisors of 1000 that are between 658 and 868.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
