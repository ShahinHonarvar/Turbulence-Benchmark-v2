Here's a Python function that uses numpy to solve the problem. The function iterates through all possible submatrices of the given size (10 in this case) and checks if the sum of the submatrix equals 10. If it does, the count is incremented.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n=10):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            if np.sum(matrix[i:i+3, j:j+3]) == n:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the submatrix size is 3x3 (since 10 integers / 3 rows = 3.33, which is not possible with integer matrix dimensions). If you want to find submatrices of different sizes, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
