This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as an argument. It iterates through all possible submatrices of the given matrix and checks if each submatrix contains exactly 122 integers. If a submatrix is found that meets this condition, the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the count of submatrices that contain 122 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns 0.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
