Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for. It uses NumPy to handle the matrix operations. This function iterates over all possible submatrices of the input matrix and checks if the sum of each submatrix is equal to 69 (since each submatrix should contain 69 integers). If such a submatrix is found, the count is incremented and returned at the end.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i+1, rows+1):\n                for l in range(j+1, cols+1):\n                    if np.sum(matrix[i:k, j:l]) == 69:\n                        count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input matrix is a 2D NumPy array of integers. If the input matrix is not a NumPy array, you might need to convert it to a NumPy array before passing it to this function. Also, this function might take a while to execute if the input matrix is large because it checks all possible submatrices.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
