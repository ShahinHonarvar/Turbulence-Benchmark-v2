Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for. This function uses numpy's rolling window function to generate all possible submatrices of a given size and then checks if the sum of each submatrix is equal to 186. If it is, the count is incremented.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    n = int(np.sqrt(matrix.size))\n    submatrix_size = int(np.sqrt(186))\n    target_sum = 186\n    count = 0\n\n    # Create a view of the array with overlapping strides\n    sub_shape = (n - submatrix_size + 1, n - submatrix_size + 1, submatrix_size, submatrix_size)\n    view_shape = submatrix_size * submatrix_size\n    strides = matrix.strides + matrix.strides\n    subs = as_strided(matrix, shape=sub_shape, strides=strides)\n\n    # Sum the elements of each submatrix and compare to target_sum\n    for sub in subs:\n        if np.sum(sub) == target_sum:\n            count += 1\n\n    return count\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input matrix is a square matrix and that the size of the submatrix (which is the square root of 186) is also an integer. If these assumptions are not valid, you might need to modify the function accordingly.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
