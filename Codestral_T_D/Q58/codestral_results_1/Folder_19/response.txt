It calculates the number of submatrices with exactly 17 elements each. It uses a sliding window approach, where it iterates over the matrix, and for each element, it checks all possible submatrices of size 17x17 with that element as the top-left corner. If the sum of the submatrix equals 17*value (where 'value' is the value of the element), it means that the submatrix contains 17 instances of that value, and the count is incremented.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    value = 17\n    for i in range(rows - 3):\n        for j in range(cols - 3):\n            if np.sum(matrix[i:i+4, j:j+4]) == 17*value:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the submatrices are 4x4 (since 4*4 = 16, and 16+1 = 17). If the submatrices can be of different sizes, the approach would need to be modified to check all possible submatrix sizes that satisfy the condition.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
