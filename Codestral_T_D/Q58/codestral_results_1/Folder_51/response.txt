Here's a Python function that uses NumPy to solve the problem. The function loops over all possible submatrices and checks if the sum of elements in each submatrix is equal to 95 * the number of elements in the submatrix. If so, it increments a counter.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i, rows):\n                for l in range(j, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == 95 * submatrix.size:\n                        count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all possible submatrices of the input matrix. For each submatrix, it checks if the sum of its elements is equal to 95 times the number of elements in the submatrix. If this condition is met, it increments a counter. Finally, the function returns the counter, which is the number of submatrices that meet the condition.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
