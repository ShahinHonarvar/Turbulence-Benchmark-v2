Here's a possible solution using Python and the numpy library. This function uses a sliding window approach to iterate over all possible submatrices of the given size, and checks if each submatrix contains exactly 68 integers.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n=68):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            if np.count_nonzero(matrix[i:i+3, j:j+3]) == n:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the submatrices we're looking for are 3x3, since no size was specified in the problem statement. If this assumption is incorrect, you'll need to modify the size of the sliding window accordingly.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
