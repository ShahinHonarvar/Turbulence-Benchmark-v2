It uses a sliding window approach to iterate over each possible submatrix of the given numpy matrix and check if the sum of its elements is equal to `n*29`, where `n` is the number of elements in the submatrix we are looking for. If such a submatrix is found, the function increments a counter. The function finally returns the value of the counter.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the numpy package is already imported. If not, please add the following line at the beginning of your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    n = 29\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i, rows):\n                for l in range(j, cols):\n                    if np.sum(matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]) == n * 29:\n                        count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will return the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 29 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, it will return 0.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
