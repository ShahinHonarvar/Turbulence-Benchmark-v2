Here's a Python function that uses NumPy to solve the problem. This function will iterate through all possible submatrices of the given size and check if the sum of elements in each submatrix is 115. If it is, the counter is incremented.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    target_sum = 115\n    count = 0\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n\n    for row_start in range(rows):\n        for col_start in range(cols):\n            for row_end in range(row_start, rows):\n                for col_end in range(col_start, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[row_start:row_end+1, col_start:col_end+1]\n                    if submatrix.sum() == target_sum:\n                        count += 1\n\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by using four nested loops to iterate through all possible starting and ending points of submatrices. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum of its elements and checks if it's equal to the target sum. If it is, it increments the counter. Finally, it returns the count.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
