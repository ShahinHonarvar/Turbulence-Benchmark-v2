This function iterates over all possible submatrices of the given matrix and checks if the sum of each submatrix is equal to 180. If it is, the function increments a counter.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i, rows):\n                for l in range(j, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == 180 and submatrix.size == 180:\n                        count += 1\n\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by first getting the shape of the matrix to determine the number of rows and columns. It then uses four nested loops to iterate over all possible submatrices of the given matrix. For each submatrix, it checks if the sum of its elements is equal to 180 and if the total number of elements is also 180. If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the counter. Finally, it returns the counter.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
