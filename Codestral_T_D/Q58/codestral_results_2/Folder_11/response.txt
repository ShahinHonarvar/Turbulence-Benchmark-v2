I'll define a function called 'submatrix_with_n_numbers' which takes a 2D numpy matrix as an argument. I'll then iterate through all possible submatrices of the given matrix and check if each submatrix contains exactly 38 integers. If so, I'll increment a counter. Finally, the function will return the count of such submatrices. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return 0.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    count = 0\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i+1, rows+1):\n                for l in range(j+1, cols+1):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k, j:l]\n                    if submatrix.size == 38:\n                        count += 1\n    return count\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
