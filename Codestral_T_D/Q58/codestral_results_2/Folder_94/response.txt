I will write a Python function called 'submatrix_with_n_numbers' that takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument. This function will iterate through all possible submatrices of the given matrix and count the number of submatrices that contain exactly 93 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return 0. Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(rows - 2):\n        for j in range(cols - 2):\n            if np.sum(matrix[i:i+3, j:j+3]) == 93:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function assumes that by 'submatrices' you mean 3x3 matrices. If you mean submatrices of any size, the function would need to be modified to consider all possible submatrix sizes.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
