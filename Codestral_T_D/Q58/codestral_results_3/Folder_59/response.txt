I'll write a Python function called 'submatrix_with_n_numbers' that uses NumPy to solve the problem. The function will iterate over all possible submatrices of the given matrix and check if each submatrix contains 76 integers. If it does, the function will increment a counter. Here's the code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    n = 76\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i+n, rows+1):\n                for l in range(j+n, cols+1):\n                    if np.count_nonzero(matrix[i:k, j:l] == 76) == n:\n                        count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function first gets the shape of the matrix. Then it iterates over all possible submatrices of the matrix. For each submatrix, it uses np.count_nonzero to count the number of elements that are equal to 76. If this count is equal to n (which is 76 in this case), it increments the counter. Finally, it returns the counter.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
