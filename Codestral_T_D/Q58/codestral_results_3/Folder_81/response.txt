The function will count all the submatrices that contain exactly 97 integers each. If no such submatrix exists, the function will return 0.\n\nTo achieve this, I will use nested loops to iterate through the matrix. For each element, I will start another pair of nested loops to create all possible submatrices. Then, I will check the sum of each submatrix. If the sum is equal to 97, I will increment the counter. Finally, I will return the counter.\n\nLet's write this function now.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i+1, rows+1):\n                for l in range(j+1, cols+1):\n                    if np.sum(matrix[i:k, j:l]) == 97:\n                        count += 1\n    return count\n```\nThe 'submatrix_with_n_numbers' function has been successfully defined. This function takes a 2-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument. It iterates over the matrix to generate all possible submatrices. For each submatrix, it checks if the sum of all its elements is equal to 97. If this condition is satisfied, it increments a counter. Finally, it returns the counter.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
