It then computes all possible submatrices of the given matrix and counts how many of these submatrices contain exactly 176 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns 0. The code makes use of numpy's functions to perform these operations efficiently.\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            for h in range(r, rows):\n                for w in range(c, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[r:h+1, c:w+1]\n                    if submatrix.size == 176 and np.all(submatrix == 176):\n                        count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nYou can call this function with a numpy matrix to get the count of submatrices that contain 176 integers each.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
