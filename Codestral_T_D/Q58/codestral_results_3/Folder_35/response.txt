The function will then search for all submatrices of the given matrix that contain exactly 111 integers each and return the count. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return 0. The reasoning is that a 3x3 submatrix is needed to contain 111 integers, and by using the sliding window technique, we can iterate through the matrix and count the number of 3x3 submatrices that meet the condition.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
