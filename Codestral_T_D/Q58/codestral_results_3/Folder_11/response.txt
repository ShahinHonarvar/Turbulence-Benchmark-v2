Here's a simple way to do it using numpy and scipy's signal.convolve2d function to perform a 2D convolution, which in this case will be used to count the number of occurrences of a submatrix with a sum of 38 * the size of the submatrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.signal import convolve2d\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n=38):\n    submatrix_size = 3  # Assuming submatrix size is 3x3, can be changed as needed\n    target_sum = n * submatrix_size\n    submatrix = np.ones((submatrix_size, submatrix_size))\n    convolution_result = convolve2d(matrix, submatrix, mode='valid')\n    return np.sum(convolution_result == target_sum)\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a submatrix of ones and convolving it with the input matrix. The convolution operation sums the products of elements of submatrix and corresponding elements of portions of the input matrix, effectively summing up all submatrices of the input matrix with the same size as submatrix. The function then counts the number of submatrices that have a sum equal to the target sum.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
