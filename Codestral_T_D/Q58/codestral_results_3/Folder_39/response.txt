The function iterates through all possible submatrices of size 59 (as each submatrix should contain 59 integers) and checks if their sum is equal to 59 * the value of an integer in that submatrix. If such a submatrix is found, the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the count of all such submatrices. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns 0.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
