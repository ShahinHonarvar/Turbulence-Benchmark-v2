Here\'s the Python function you described, using numpy to handle the matrix operations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n=18):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    submatrices = 0\n\n    for i in range(rows - 3):\n        for j in range(cols - 3):\n            submatrix = matrix[i:i+4, j:j+4]\n            if np.count_nonzero(submatrix) == n:\n                submatrices += 1\n\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each possible 4x4 submatrix in the given matrix (since a 4x4 matrix has 16 elements, and we\'re looking for submatrices with 18 elements, we need to consider submatrices that are larger than 4x4). For each submatrix, it checks if the number of non-zero elements is equal to 18. If it is, it increments the count of submatrices. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices that satisfy this condition.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the "18 integers" in the submatrix are non-zero integers. If you mean 18 integers regardless of their value, you would need to adjust the condition in the if statement accordingly.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
