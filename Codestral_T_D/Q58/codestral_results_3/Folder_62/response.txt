Here's a Python function that uses NumPy to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n=186):\n    r, c = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for x in range(r):\n        for y in range(c):\n            for i in range(x, r):\n                for j in range(y, c):\n                    if np.sum(matrix[x:i+1, y:j+1]) == n:\n                        count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all possible submatrices of the given matrix and checking if the sum of their elements is equal to 186. If it is, it increments a counter. At the end, it returns the counter, which is the total number of submatrices that satisfy the condition.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
