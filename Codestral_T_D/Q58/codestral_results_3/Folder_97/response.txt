Here's a simple Python function that uses numpy to solve the problem. This function iterates over all possible submatrices of the given size (120 elements) and checks if the sum of their elements is 120. If so, it increments the counter.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    submatrix_size = 120\n    matrix_size = matrix.shape[0] * matrix.shape[1]\n\n    if submatrix_size > matrix_size:\n        return 0\n\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - int(np.sqrt(submatrix_size)) + 1):\n        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - int(np.sqrt(submatrix_size)) + 1):\n            for k in range(int(np.sqrt(submatrix_size))):\n                for l in range(int(np.sqrt(submatrix_size))):\n                    if np.sum(matrix[i:i+k+1, j:j+l+1]) == 120:\n                        count += 1\n\n    return count\n```\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the size of the submatrix (120 elements) is a perfect square. If that's not the case, the code will need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlso, this code doesn't handle the case where the submatrix size is larger than the matrix size. In that case, it returns 0. If you want to handle that differently, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
