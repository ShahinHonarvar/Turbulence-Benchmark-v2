This function takes a 2D numpy matrix of integers as its argument and returns the count of all submatrices that contain exactly 83 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return 0.\n\nThe function works by iterating over all possible submatrices of the given matrix and checking if the sum of their elements is equal to 83 times the size of the submatrix. If such a submatrix is found, the count is incremented.\n\nHere's the Python code for the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    n = 83\n    count = 0\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i+1, rows+1):\n                for l in range(j+1, cols+1):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k, j:l]\n                    if submatrix.size == n and submatrix.sum() == n * submatrix.size:\n                        count += 1\n\n    return count\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
