The function will iterate through all possible submatrices of the given matrix and count the number of submatrices that contain exactly 76 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return 0. I will use the numpy library's functions to perform matrix operations.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i+1, rows+1):\n                for l in range(j+1, cols+1):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k, j:l]\n                    if submatrix.size == 76:\n                        count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing your two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument. The function will return the count of submatrices with exactly 76 integers each.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
