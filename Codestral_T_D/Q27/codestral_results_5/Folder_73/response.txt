It uses Python's list slicing to create a new list that is identical to the original list, except that the number 637.22 is inserted at index 88. The original list's elements before index 88 are included in the new list, then 637.22 is added, and finally the original list's elements from index 88 onwards are appended. This results in a new list that is one element longer than the original list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
