Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function takes a list of integers as an argument.\n2. It defines a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.\n3. It uses list comprehension to filter out the prime numbers from index 14 to index 73 (both inclusive) from the input list.\n4. The filtered prime numbers are then sorted in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse` parameter set to `True`.\n5. Finally, the function returns the sorted list of prime numbers. If no prime numbers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it and passing the list of integers as an argument. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]\nprimes = find_primes_between_indices(numbers)\nprint(primes)\n```\n\nThis will print the sorted list of prime numbers from index 14 to index 73 (both inclusive) in descending order. If no prime numbers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be printed.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
