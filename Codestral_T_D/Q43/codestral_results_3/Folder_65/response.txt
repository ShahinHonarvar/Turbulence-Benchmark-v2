This function will check all numbers from index 76 to 92 (inclusive) to see if they are prime numbers. A number is considered prime if it only has two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\nI will iterate through the numbers in the specified range and add any prime numbers to a new list. After iterating through all the numbers, I will sort this list in ascending order and return it. If no prime numbers are found in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nLet's write the code for this function.\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(numbers):\n    def is_prime(n):\n        if n < 2:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    primes = [num for num in numbers[76:93] if is_prime(num)]\n    return sorted(primes)\n```\nI have written the Python function 'find_primes_between_indices' according to your specifications. This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 76 to index 92 (both inclusive). If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a list of integers as an argument.\n```python\nnumbers = list(range(1, 101))\nfind_primes_between_indices(numbers)\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
