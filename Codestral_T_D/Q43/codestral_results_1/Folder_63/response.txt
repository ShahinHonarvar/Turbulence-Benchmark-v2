The function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 28 to index 36, inclusive. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(numbers):\n    primes = []\n    for num in numbers[28:37]:\n        if num > 1:\n            for i in range(2, int(num/2) + 1):\n                if (num % i) == 0:\n                    break\n            else:\n                primes.append(num)\n    return sorted(primes)\n```\n\nThis code defines the function 'find_primes_between_indices' that iterates over the specified range of numbers and checks if each number is prime. A number is considered prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. If a number is prime, it is appended to the 'primes' list. Finally, the sorted 'primes' list is returned as the result.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
