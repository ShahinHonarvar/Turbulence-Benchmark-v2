This function will iterate over the elements of the list from index 7 to 9 (inclusive). It will check if each number is prime by dividing it by all numbers less than itself and greater than 1. If a number is only divisible by 1 and itself, it is considered a prime number. The prime numbers found will be added to a new list. After iterating through the specified indices, this list will be sorted in descending order and returned as the output. If no prime numbers are found in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.\n\nNow, I'll write and execute the Python code.\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(nums):\n    def is_prime(n):\n        if n <= 1:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, n):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    primes = [num for num in nums[7:10] if is_prime(num)]\n    primes.sort(reverse=True)\n    return primes\n```\nThe 'find_primes_between_indices' function has been defined successfully. Now, let's test it with an example.\n\nLet's use the list [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] as the input. This list contains the numbers from 10 to 19. The prime numbers between indices 7 and 9 (both inclusive) are 17 and 19. According to the specification, the function should return these numbers in descending order.\n\nLet's test the function.\n```python\ntest_list = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]\nfind_primes_between_indices(test_list)\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
