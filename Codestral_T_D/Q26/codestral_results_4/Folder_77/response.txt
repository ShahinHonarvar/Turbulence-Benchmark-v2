The function will iterate over the elements in the list and sum up all the integers that are between 136 and 618, both inclusive. If no such integers are found, the function will return 0.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if 136 <= num <= 618:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of integers as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]\nprint(sum_in_range(numbers))\n```\n\nThis will output `500` as it is the only integer between 136 and 618 in the given list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
