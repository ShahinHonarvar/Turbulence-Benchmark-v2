This function iterates through the list and adds up all the integers that are between -993 and -51 (both inclusive). If the list does not contain any such integers, the function returns 0. Here's the Python code for this function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(lst):\n    return sum(i for i in lst if -993 <= i <= -51)\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a list of integers as an argument, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = sum_in_range([-100, -60, 0, 50, -994, -51])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output the sum of the integers from the list that are between -993 and -51, which is -994 and -51, resulting in -1045.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
