This function will return a list of all integers in the specified list that are divisible by both 6 and 1 (which is all integers, as 1 is a factor of all numbers) and are located in the list from index 3 to index 9 (both inclusive). If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[3:10] if num % 6 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to create a new list of all integers in the specified range that are divisible by 6. The modulo operator (%), when used with 6, returns 0 if the number is divisible by 6, and a non-zero value otherwise. The function then returns this new list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
