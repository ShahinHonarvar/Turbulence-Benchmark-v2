This function should return a list of all integers divisible by both -1 and -7 from index 2 to index 7, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nSince -1 and -7 are both negative numbers, the only integer that is divisible by both is -7. However, since it\'s not possible for an integer to be divisible by -1 (as division by -1 would result in a negative of that integer, which is not an integer), I\'m assuming that the requirement might be a mistake and should be "divisible by both 1 and 7".\n\nHere\'s the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst[2:8] if i % 1 == 0 and i % 7 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to filter the elements in the specified range of the list that are divisible by both 1 and 7. If no such integer exists, an empty list is returned.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
