The function will then filter this list to only include integers that are divisible by both 6 and -3 (which is equivalent to dividing by 6 since -3 divides 6). It will only consider integers from index 0 to index 9 (both inclusive). If no such integers exist in this range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nHere's the Python code for this:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst[0:10] if i % 6 == 0]\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
