This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all integers divisible by both -6 and 4 from index 0 to index 1, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):\n    return [x for x in lst[0:2] if x % 6 == 0 and x % 4 == 0]\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a list of integers as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [12, 18, 24, 30]\nresult = all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output: `[12]` since 12 is the only integer divisible by both -6 and 4 from index 0 to index 1 in the 'numbers' list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
