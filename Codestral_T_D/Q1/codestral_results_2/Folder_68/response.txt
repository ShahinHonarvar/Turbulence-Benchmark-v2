Here's a simple Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return lst[:9]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that contains all elements from the start of the list up to, and including, the element at index 8.\n\nPlease note that Python indexing starts from 0, so the element at index 8 is the 9th element in the list. That's why we use `lst[:9]` to get elements up to, but not including, index 9.\n\nYou can test this function with a list of integers like this:\n\n```python\nprint(all_ints_inclusive([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
