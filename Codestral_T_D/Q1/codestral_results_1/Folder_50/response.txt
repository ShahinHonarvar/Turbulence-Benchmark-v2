This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list containing all the elements from index 12 to index 92, both inclusive. Here's the code:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return lst[12:93]\n```\n\nThis function uses slicing to extract the desired elements from the input list. The syntax `lst[12:93]` means that it will start slicing from index 12 and stop at index 93 (exclusive). The resulting list will include elements from index 12 up to and including index 92.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
