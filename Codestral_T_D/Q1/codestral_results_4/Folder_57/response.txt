The `[62:93]` syntax is called list slicing in Python, and it creates a new list by selecting a range of elements from the original list. In this case, the range is from index 62 to index 93, but since the end index is exclusive, we need to use 93 to include the element at index 92.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
