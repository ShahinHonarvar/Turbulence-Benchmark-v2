The function will sort the slice of the list from index 35 to 60 (both inclusive) and then return the 4th smallest number from that slice.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):\n    return sorted(numbers[35:61])[3]\n```\n\nThe function `sorted(numbers[35:61])` sorts the slice of the list from index 35 to 60 (both inclusive). The indexing is exclusive for the end index, hence 61 is used to include the element at index 60. The number 3 is used to access the 4th smallest number (as list indices start from 0).", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
