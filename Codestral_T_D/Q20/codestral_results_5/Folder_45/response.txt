Here's how I will implement this:\n\n1. Define a function 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes a list as an argument.\n2. Within the function, slice the list to include only the first 16 elements (as Python indices start at 0).\n3. Sort this sliced list in ascending order.\n4. Return the element at index 15 (as Python indices start at 0).\n\nLet's write and execute the Python code for this.\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):\n    return sorted(numbers[:16])[15]\n```\nThe function 'find_n_th_smallest_num' has been successfully defined. I will now test it with a sample list to ensure it works as expected.\n\nLet's use the list [20, 15, 8, 22, 19, 30, 12, 18, 4, 17, 25, 10, 11, 2, 3, 6, 16, 9, 7, 1, 14, 13, 5, 21, 24, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29] as an input to the function.\n```python\nnumbers = [20, 15, 8, 22, 19, 30, 12, 18, 4, 17, 25, 10, 11, 2, 3, 6, 16, 9, 7, 1, 14, 13, 5, 21, 24, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29]\nfind_n_th_smallest_num(numbers)\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
