Here's a simple function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    return sorted(nums[4:8])[3]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input. It slices the list to include only the numbers from index 4 to index 7 (inclusive) and then sorts this slice. It then returns the 4th smallest number (which is at index 3 since Python uses 0-based indexing).", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
