This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 6th smallest number from index 18 to index 82, both inclusive. Here is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):\n    sublist = numbers[18:83]\n    sublist.sort()\n    return sublist[5]\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a list of numbers as the argument. For example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]\nresult = find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output the 6th smallest number from index 18 to index 82 of the given `numbers` list.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
