I will write a Python function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes a list of distinct numbers as input. This function will sort the sublist of numbers from index 2 to index 9 (both inclusive) and return the 6th smallest number from this sublist.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets your specifications:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):\n    sublist = sorted(numbers[2:10])\n    return sublist[5]\n```\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It extracts the sublist from index 2 to index 9 (both inclusive) of the input list 'numbers'.\n2. It sorts this sublist in ascending order.\n3. It returns the 6th smallest number from this sublist, which is at index 5 (since Python uses 0-based indexing).", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
