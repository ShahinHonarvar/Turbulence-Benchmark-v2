Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):\n    # Slice the list from index 42 to 67 and sort it\n    sliced_numbers = sorted(numbers[42:68])\n    # Return the 6th smallest number\n    return sliced_numbers[5]\n```\n\nThis function works by first slicing the input list to include only the elements from index 42 to 67. It then sorts this sliced list in ascending order. Finally, it returns the 6th element of this sorted list, which is the 6th smallest number between index 42 and 67.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
