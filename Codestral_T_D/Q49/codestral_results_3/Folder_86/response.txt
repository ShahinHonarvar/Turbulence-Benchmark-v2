Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for. It first converts the binary string to a decimal integer, then checks if it's divisible by the 135th number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n```python\ndef if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_string):\n    # Convert binary string to decimal integer\n    decimal = int(binary_string, 2)\n\n    # Calculate the 135th number in the Fibonacci sequence\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(135):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n    # Check if the decimal number is divisible by the 135th Fibonacci number\n    return decimal % a == 0\n```\n\nThis function works by first converting the binary string to a decimal integer using the `int()` function with base 2. It then calculates the 135th number in the Fibonacci sequence by initializing two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively, and then iteratively updating `a` and `b` to be the next two numbers in the sequence. Finally, it checks if the decimal number is divisible by the 135th Fibonacci number by using the modulus operator `%` to check if the remainder of the division is 0. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
