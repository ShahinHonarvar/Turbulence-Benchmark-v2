Here's a Python function that should meet your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    s = s[:21]  # Consider only the first 21 characters\n    s = s.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(5, 81):  # Check lengths from 5 to 80\n        for start in range(len(s) - length + 1):\n            substring = s[start:start + length]\n            if substring == substring[::-1] and substring.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function works by first restricting the input string to the first 21 characters and converting it to lowercase. It then iterates over all possible lengths of palindromes (from 5 to 80) and all possible starting positions of those palindromes in the string. For each potential palindrome, it checks if the substring is equal to its reverse (which is the definition of a palindrome) and if it consists only of English letters. If both conditions are met, the palindrome is added to the set of results. Finally, the function returns the set of all palindromes that meet the requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
