The function finds all palindromes in the substring from index 0 to index 300 (both inclusive) of the given string. Only palindromes of lengths between 50 to 60 (both inclusive) are considered. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. The function returns a set of all palindromes that meet these requirements. The function performs a case-insensitive search for palindromes. If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function returns an empty set.\n```python\n# Testing the function with an example\ns = 'Able, was I ere I saw Elba. This sentence is a palindrome. Racecar is a palindrome. This is not a palindrome.'\npalindromes_of_specific_lengths(s)\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
