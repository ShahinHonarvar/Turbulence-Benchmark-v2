Here is a Python function that does just that:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    s = s[:7].lower()  # limit the string to first 7 characters and convert to lower case\n    return {s[i:j] for i in range(len(s)) for j in range(i + 3, min(i + 7, len(s) + 1)) if s[i:j] == s[i:j][::-1] and s[i:j].isalpha()}\n```\n\nThis function first limits the input string to the first 7 characters and converts it to lower case. It then uses a set comprehension to generate all possible substrings of the required lengths. For each substring, it checks if the substring is equal to its reverse (i.e., it is a palindrome) and if it consists only of English letters. If both conditions are met, the substring is added to the set. Finally, the function returns the set of all such palindromes.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
