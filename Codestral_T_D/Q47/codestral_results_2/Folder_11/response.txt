Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function takes one argument, a string called `s`.\n2. It extracts the substring from index 24 to index 97 (both inclusive) from the input string `s`.\n3. It initializes an empty set called `palindromes` to store the palindromes that meet the requirements.\n4. It iterates over all possible lengths of palindromes, from 10 to 36 (both inclusive).\n5. For each length, it iterates over all possible starting indices of the palindromes in the substring.\n6. It extracts a substring of the current length starting from the current index.\n7. It checks if the substring consists only of English letters and if it is a palindrome (case-insensitive).\n8. If the substring meets both conditions, it adds it to the `palindromes` set.\n9. Finally, the function returns the `palindromes` set.\n\nYou can now use this function to find the palindromes that satisfy the given requirements from a given string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
