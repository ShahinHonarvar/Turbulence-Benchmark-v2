The function will be named 'palindromes_of_specific_lengths' and it will take a single argument, which is a string. Here's the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    import re\n    s = s[16:95]\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(39, 53):\n        for i in range(len(s) - length + 1):\n            sub = s[i:i+length]\n            if sub.lower() == sub.lower()[::-1] and sub.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(sub)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the substring from index 16 to index 94 (both inclusive) of the input string. Then it iterates over all possible lengths of palindromes from 39 to 52 (both inclusive). For each length, it generates all possible substrings of that length from the input string. If a substring is a palindrome (i.e., it's the same forwards and backwards) and it consists only of English letters, it's added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes that meet the specified requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
