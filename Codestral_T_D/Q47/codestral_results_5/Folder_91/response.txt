The function will take a string as input, and it will find and return the set of all palindromes that meet the following requirements:\n\n1. Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 0 to index 10, both inclusive.\n2. Only palindromes of lengths between 3 to 5, both inclusive.\n3. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n4. The function will find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(i+3, min(i+6, 11)):\n            substring = s[i:j]\n            if substring.isalpha() and substring.lower() == substring.lower()[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nYou can use this function to find the set of palindromes that satisfy the given requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
