Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = s[125:284].lower()\n    length = len(substring)\n\n    for i in range(length):\n        for j in range(i+109, min(i+127, length)):\n            sub = substring[i:j+1]\n            if sub == sub[::-1] and sub.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(sub)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function takes a string 's' as input and finds all palindromes that satisfy the given requirements. It first extracts the substring from index 125 to index 283 (both inclusive) and converts it to lowercase. Then, it iterates over the substring to find palindromes of lengths between 109 to 126 (both inclusive). Each palindrome is checked to ensure that it only consists of English letters. The function returns the set of all palindromes that meet the requirements. If no such palindromes are found, an empty set is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
