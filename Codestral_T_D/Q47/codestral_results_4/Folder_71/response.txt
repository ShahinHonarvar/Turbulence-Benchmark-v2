This function takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes that meet the specified requirements.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the function:\n\n- It first extracts the substring from index 18 to index 65 of the input string.\n- It then iterates through all possible lengths of palindromes, from 23 to 36.\n- For each length, it checks all possible substrings of that length within the extracted substring.\n- If a substring is a palindrome (i.e., it is equal to its reverse and it consists only of English letters), it is added to the set of palindromes.\n- Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nYou can now use this function to find palindromes that meet the specified requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
