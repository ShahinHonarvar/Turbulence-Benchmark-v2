This function should return a set of all palindromes that meet the following criteria:\n\n1. The palindromes should be found in the substring from index 75 to index 95 (both inclusive) of the input string.\n2. The length of the palindromes should be between 7 to 9 (both inclusive).\n3. The palindromes should only consist of English letters.\n4. If no such palindrome of the specified length occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set.\n5. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    s = s[75:96].lower()  # Extract the substring and convert it to lowercase\n    palindromes = set()  # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes\n\n    # Iterate over the possible lengths (7 to 9)\n    for length in range(7, 10):\n        # Iterate over the substring to find palindromes of the current length\n        for i in range(len(s) - length + 1):\n            substring = s[i:i + length]\n            # Check if the substring is a palindrome and contains only English letters\n            if substring == substring[::-1] and substring.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the substring from index 75 to 95 of the input string and converts it to lowercase. It then iterates over the possible lengths (7 to 9) and finds all palindromes of those lengths in the substring. Each palindrome is added to the set of palindromes, which is then returned by the function.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
