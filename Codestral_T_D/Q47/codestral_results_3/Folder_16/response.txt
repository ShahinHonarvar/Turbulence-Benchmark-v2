This function takes a string as input and returns a set of all palindromes that meet the specified requirements. Here's a brief explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. We first extract the substring from index 15 to index 86 (both inclusive) from the input string.\n2. We then initialize an empty set to store the palindromes that meet the requirements.\n3. We iterate through all possible lengths of palindromes from 51 to 60 (both inclusive).\n4. For each length, we iterate through the substring to check for palindromes of that length.\n5. We convert each substring to lowercase to perform the palindrome check in a case-insensitive manner.\n6. If a substring is a palindrome and consists only of English letters, we add it to the set of palindromes.\n7. Finally, we return the set of palindromes.\n\nYou can now use the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function to find palindromes that meet the specified requirements in a given string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
