This function takes one argument, which is a string. It returns the set of all palindromes that occur within the substring from index 13 to index 95 (both inclusive) and have lengths between 57 to 60 (both inclusive). Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    s = s[13:96].lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - 56):\n        for j in range(57, 61):\n            if i + j <= len(s):\n                substring = s[i:i + j]\n                if substring == substring[::-1]:\n                    if substring.isalpha():\n                        palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a string as the argument. It will return the set of all palindromes that meet the specified requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
