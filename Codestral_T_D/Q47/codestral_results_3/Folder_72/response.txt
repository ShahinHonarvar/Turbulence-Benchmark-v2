Here's a breakdown of what the function does:\n\n1. The function takes one argument, a string.\n2. It extracts the substring from index 26 to index 90 (both inclusive) from the given string.\n3. It initializes an empty set to store the palindromes that meet the specified requirements.\n4. It iterates over all possible lengths of palindromes, from 27 to 58 (both inclusive).\n5. For each length, it extracts all possible substrings of that length from the extracted substring.\n6. It checks if each substring is a palindrome and if it consists only of English letters. If it meets both conditions, it adds it to the set of palindromes.\n7. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes that meet the specified requirements.\n\nYou can now use the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function to find palindromes in a string that meet the given requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
