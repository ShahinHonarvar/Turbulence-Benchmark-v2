Here's a Python function that should meet your requirements:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    s = s[26:88]  # Extract the substring from index 26 to 87\n    palindromes = set()  # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes\n    for length in range(52, 57):  # Loop through the lengths 52 to 56\n        for i in range(len(s) - length + 1):  # Loop through the substring\n            sub = s[i:i+length]  # Extract the substring of the current length\n            if sub.lower() == sub[::-1].lower() and sub.isalpha():  # Check if it's a palindrome and only consists of English letters\n                palindromes.add(sub)  # If it is, add it to the set\n    return palindromes  # Return the set of palindromes\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the substring from index 26 to 87. It then loops through all possible lengths between 52 to 56. For each length, it loops through the substring and checks if each substring of the current length is a palindrome and only consists of English letters. If it is, it adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
