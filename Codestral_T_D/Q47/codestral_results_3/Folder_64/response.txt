This function takes a string as input and returns a set of all palindromes that satisfy the given requirements.\n\nThe function only considers palindromes occurring in the substring from index 0 to index 7 (both inclusive). It only considers palindromes of lengths between 4 to 5 (both inclusive). Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. The function finds the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a string as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = palindromes_of_specific_lengths("MadamAroraTeachesMalayalam")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output a set of palindromes that satisfy the given requirements.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
