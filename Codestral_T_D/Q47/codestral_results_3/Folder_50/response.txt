The function takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes that meet the specified requirements.\n\nHere's a quick explanation of the function:\n- The function first extracts the substring from index 36 to index 92 (both inclusive) from the given string.\n- It then iterates through all possible lengths of palindromes between 10 to 35 (both inclusive).\n- For each length, the function checks if a palindrome of that length occurs in the substring.\n- If a palindrome is found, it is added to the set of palindromes.\n- Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nYou can use this function to find all palindromes that meet the specified requirements in a given string.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
