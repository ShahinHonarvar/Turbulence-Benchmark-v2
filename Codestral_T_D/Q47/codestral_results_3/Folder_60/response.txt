The function takes a string as input and returns a set of all palindromes that meet the specified conditions.\n\nHere\'s how the function works:\n\n1. The function extracts the substring from index 23 to index 82 (both inclusive) of the input string.\n2. It then iterates through all possible starting indices of the palindromes within the extracted substring.\n3. For each starting index, it checks all possible lengths of the palindromes from 32 to 34 (both inclusive).\n4. If a palindrome is found that meets all the requirements (length, case-insensitivity, and consisting only of English letters), it is added to the set of palindromes.\n5. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nYou can now test the function by calling it with a string as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = palindromes_of_specific_lengths("Your input string here")\nprint(result)\n```', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
