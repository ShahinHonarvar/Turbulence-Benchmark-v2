The function takes a string as an argument and returns the set of all palindromes that meet the requirements.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n- The `is_palindrome` function is defined to check if a given string is a palindrome or not. It converts the string to lowercase and compares it with its reverse.\n- The `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function extracts the substring from index 18 to index 87 (inclusive) of the input string.\n- It iterates over all possible lengths between 38 and 60 (inclusive) and checks for all substrings of that length in the extracted substring.\n- It checks if the substring is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function and if it only consists of English letters.\n- If the substring meets all the requirements, it is added to the set of palindromes.\n- Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nYou can now use the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function to find the set of palindromes that meet the specified requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
