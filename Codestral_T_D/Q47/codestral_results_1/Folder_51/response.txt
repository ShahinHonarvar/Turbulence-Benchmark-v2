This function takes a string as input and returns a set of all palindromes that meet the specified requirements.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the function:\n\n1. It first extracts the substring from index 2 to index 8 (both inclusive) of the given string.\n2. It then iterates over all possible lengths of palindromes, from 3 to 4 (both inclusive).\n3. For each length, it generates all possible substrings of that length from the extracted substring.\n4. It checks if each substring is a palindrome and if it consists only of English letters.\n5. If a substring meets both criteria, it is added to the set of palindromes.\n6. Finally, the set of palindromes is returned.\n\nYou can now use the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function in your code.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
