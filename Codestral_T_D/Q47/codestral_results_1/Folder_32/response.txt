It takes a single argument, a string.\n2. It defines a helper function called `is_palindrome` that checks if a given word is a palindrome. The function converts the word to lowercase and compares it with its reverse. If they are the same, the word is considered a palindrome.\n3. The function initializes an empty set called `palindromes` to store the resulting palindromes.\n4. It iterates through each possible starting index `i` in the range from 16 to 77 (inclusive) of the input string.\n5. For each starting index `i`, it iterates through each possible length `length` in the range from 43 to 47 (inclusive).\n6. It extracts a substring of length `length` starting at index `i`.\n7. If the substring consists only of English letters and is a palindrome (as determined by the `is_palindrome` function), it adds the substring to the `palindromes` set.\n8. Finally, it returns the `palindromes` set.\n\nYou can now use the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function to find palindromes in a given string that meet the specified requirements.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
