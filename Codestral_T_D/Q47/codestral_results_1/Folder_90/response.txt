The function will return a set of all palindromes that meet the following criteria:\n\n1. The palindromes should occur in the substring from index 106 to index 280 (both inclusive) of the given string.\n2. The palindromes should have a length between 136 and 151 (both inclusive).\n3. Each palindrome should consist only of English letters.\n4. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = s[106:281]\n    for length in range(136, 152):\n        for i in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            sub = substring[i:i + length]\n            if sub.isalpha() and sub.lower() == sub[::-1].lower():\n                palindromes.add(sub)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe function first extracts the substring from index 106 to index 280 of the given string. It then iterates over all possible lengths between 136 and 151, checking each substring of that length to see if it is a palindrome. If a substring is a palindrome and consists only of English letters, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
