Here it is:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    s = s[11:84]\n    s = s.lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(37, 61):\n        for start in range(len(s) - length + 1):\n            substring = s[start:start + length]\n            if substring == substring[::-1] and substring.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the substring from index 11 to index 83 (both inclusive) and converts it to lowercase. It then iterates over all possible lengths of palindromes (from 37 to 60) and, for each length, it iterates over all possible starting indices of the substring. For each substring, it checks if it's a palindrome (i.e., if it's equal to its reverse) and if it consists only of English letters. If both conditions are satisfied, the substring is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns this set.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
