Here's the Python code that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    s = s[45:99].lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(40, 48):\n        for start in range(0, len(s) - length + 1):\n            substring = s[start:start + length]\n            if substring == substring[::-1] and substring.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the substring from index 45 to index 98 (both inclusive) and converts it to lowercase. It then iterates over all possible lengths from 40 to 47 (both inclusive). For each length, it iterates over all possible starting indices for a substring of that length. If the substring is a palindrome and consists only of English letters, it adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
