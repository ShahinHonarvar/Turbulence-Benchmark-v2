This function takes a string as input and returns a set of all palindromes that meet the specified conditions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the function:\n\n1. The function defines a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a given string is a palindrome.\n2. The function extracts the substring from index 14 to index 90 (both inclusive) from the input string.\n3. The function initializes an empty set to store the palindromes that meet the requirements.\n4. The function iterates through all possible lengths of palindromes, from 55 to 71 (both inclusive).\n5. For each length, the function iterates through all possible starting indices in the extracted substring.\n6. The function extracts a substring of the current length starting from the current index.\n7. The function checks if the extracted substring is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.\n8. If the extracted substring is a palindrome and consists only of English letters, it is added to the set of palindromes.\n9. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nYou can now use the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function to find palindromes in a given string that meet the specified conditions.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
