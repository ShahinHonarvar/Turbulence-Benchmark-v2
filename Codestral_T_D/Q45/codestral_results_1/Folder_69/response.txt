This function will return a set of all palindromes of length at least 4 that can be created from the English letters in the given string between indices 0 and 3 (both inclusive). The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner. If no such palindromes can be created, it should return an empty set.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements this:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    from itertools import permutations\n    s = s[:4].lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(4, len(s)+1):\n        for perm in permutations(s, length):\n            word = ''.join(perm)\n            if word == word[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(word)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the first four characters of the string and converts them to lowercase. It then generates all possible permutations of these characters of length 4 or more. For each permutation, it checks if the word is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards) and, if so, adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns this set.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
