This function takes a string as input and returns a set of all palindromes of length at least 3 that can be created from the English letters in the given string between index 4 and index 5 (both inclusive). If no such palindromes can be created, the function returns an empty set. The function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    # Extract the substring between index 4 and index 5\n    substring = string[4:6].lower()\n\n    # Generate all possible permutations of the substring\n    perms = set(permutations(substring))\n\n    # Check each permutation to see if it is a palindrome\n    palindromes = set()\n    for perm in perms:\n        word = ''.join(perm)\n        if word == word[::-1] and len(word) >= 3:\n            palindromes.add(word)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nYou can now use this function to find the set of all palindromes of length at least 3 that can be created from the English letters in a given string between index 4 and index 5.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
