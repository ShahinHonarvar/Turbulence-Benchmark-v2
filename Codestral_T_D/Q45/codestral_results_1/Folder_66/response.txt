This function takes a string as input and finds all the palindromes of length at least 5 that can be created from the English letters in the given string that occur between index 0 to index 5 (both inclusive). The function returns a set of all such palindromes, or an empty set if no such palindromes can be created. The palindromes are formed in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a string argument, like this:\n\n```python\nresult = palindromes_between_indices("your_string_here")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nReplace `"your_string_here"` with the string you want to process.
