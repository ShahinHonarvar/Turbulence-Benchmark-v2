This function takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length at least 3 that can be created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 2 to index 6, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created, the function returns an empty set. The function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n\n```python\nresult = palindromes_between_indices('example')\nprint(result)\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
