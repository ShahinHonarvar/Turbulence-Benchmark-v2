Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    from itertools import permutations\n\n    # Get the substring between indices 1 and 6 (both inclusive)\n    substring = s[1:7].lower()\n\n    # Generate all permutations of the substring\n    perms = set(permutations(substring))\n\n    # Filter out palindromes of length at least 3\n    palindromes = {"".join(perm) for perm in perms if "".join(perm) == "".join(perm[::-1]) and len(perm) >= 3}\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `s` as input and returns the set of all palindromes of length at least 3 that can be created from the English letters in the given string between indices 1 to 6 (both inclusive). The function generates all permutations of the substring and filters out palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
