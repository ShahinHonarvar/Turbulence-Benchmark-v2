This function takes a string as an argument and returns the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 3 that can be created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 1 to index 2, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created, the function returns an empty set. The palindromes are formed in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    s = s[1:3].lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for p in permutations(s):\n        word = ''.join(p)\n        if word == word[::-1] and len(word) >= 3:\n            palindromes.add(word)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nYou can call this function with a string argument to get the set of palindromes.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
