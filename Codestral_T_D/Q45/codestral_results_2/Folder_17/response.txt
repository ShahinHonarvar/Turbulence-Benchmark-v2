The function takes a string as input and returns a set of all palindromes of length at least 4 that can be created from the English letters in the given string that occur between index 2 to index 6, both inclusive.\n\nThe function is case-insensitive, meaning it will form each palindrome using lowercase letters. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function will return an empty set.\n\nNow you can use this function to find all the palindromes in a given string according to the described criteria.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
