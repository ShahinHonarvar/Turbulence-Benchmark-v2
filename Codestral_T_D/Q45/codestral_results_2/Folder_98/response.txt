Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for. This function uses the `itertools` library to generate all possible permutations of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 3 to index 5 (both inclusive), and then checks which of these permutations are palindromes of length at least 4. The function returns a set of these palindromes, or an empty set if no such palindromes exist.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    s = s[3:6].lower()  # Extract and convert to lowercase\n    palindromes = set()  # Initialize an empty set for palindromes\n    for r in range(4, len(s) + 1):  # For lengths 4 to len(s)\n        for p in itertools.permutations(s, r):  # Generate permutations\n            p = ''.join(p)  # Convert permutation to string\n            if p == p[::-1]:  # If it's a palindrome\n                palindromes.add(p)  # Add it to the set\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function should work correctly as long as the string `s` is at least 6 characters long. If `s` is shorter, the function will return an empty set, since it's not possible to extract a substring of length 3 from `s` that includes both index 3 and index 5.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
