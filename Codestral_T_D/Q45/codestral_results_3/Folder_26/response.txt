The function takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length at least 3 that can be created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 4 to index 6, both inclusive. The function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    s = s.lower()\n    substring = s[4:7]\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(3, len(substring) + 1):\n        for perm in permutations(substring, length):\n            word = ''.join(perm)\n            if word == word[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(word)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling `palindromes_between_indices(your_string)` and passing your string as the argument.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
