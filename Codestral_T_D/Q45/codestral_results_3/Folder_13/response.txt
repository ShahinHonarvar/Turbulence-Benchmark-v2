Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    # Convert the string to lowercase\n    string = string.lower()\n\n    # Extract the substring between indices 3 and 9 (inclusive)\n    substring = string[3:10]\n\n    # Generate all possible permutations of the substring\n    perms = set(permutations(substring))\n\n    # Filter out permutations that are not palindromes of length at least 5\n    palindromes = {"".join(perm) for perm in perms if len(perm) >= 5 and perm == perm[::-1]}\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nYou can call this function by passing a string as an argument, and it will return a set of all palindromes of length at least 5 that can be created from the English letters in the given string that occur between index 3 to index 9. If no such palindromes can be created, the function will return an empty set.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
