Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    # Get the substring between indices 2 and 5\n    substring = string[2:6].lower()\n\n    # Generate all possible permutations of the substring\n    perms = [''.join(p) for p in permutations(substring)]\n\n    # Find palindromes of length at least 3\n    palindromes = set(p for p in perms if p == p[::-1] and len(p) >= 3)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe function takes a string as input and extracts the substring between indices 2 and 5 (inclusive). It converts the substring to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparisons.\n\nThe function then generates all possible permutations of the substring using the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module. It stores these permutations in a list called `perms`.\n\nNext, the function iterates over each permutation and checks if it is a palindrome (i.e., it is equal to its reverse) and its length is at least 3. If a palindrome is found, it is added to a set called `palindromes`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the set of all palindromes.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
