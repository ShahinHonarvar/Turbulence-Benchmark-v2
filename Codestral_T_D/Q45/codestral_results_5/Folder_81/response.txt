Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for. This function uses a recursive approach to generate all possible permutations of the letters in the given string that occur between indices 0 and 6. It then checks each permutation to see if it's a palindrome of length at least 3.\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    from itertools import permutations\n\n    # Limit the string to indices 0 to 6\n    s = s[0:7].lower()\n\n    # Generate all permutations of the string\n    perms = set(''.join(p) for i in range(3, len(s) + 1) for p in permutations(s, i))\n\n    # Filter out non-palindromes\n    palindromes = {p for p in perms if p == p[::-1]}\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function uses the `itertools.permutations` function to generate all possible permutations of the string, and then it checks each permutation to see if it's a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. The palindromes are returned as a set, which automatically removes any duplicates.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
