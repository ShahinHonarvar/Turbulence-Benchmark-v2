This function returns a set of all palindromes of length at least 4 that can be created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 5 to index 9, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function returns an empty set. The function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nNow you can use this function by calling `palindromes_between_indices(string)`, where `string` is the input string you want to check for palindromes. The function will return a set of all the palindromes that meet the criteria.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
