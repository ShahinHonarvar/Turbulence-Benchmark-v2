To solve this problem, we can use the itertools library in Python to generate all possible permutations of the substring and then check if each permutation is a palindrome. Here's the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport itertools\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    substring = s[1:10].lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(7, len(substring) + 1):\n        for perm in itertools.permutations(substring, length):\n            word = ''.join(perm)\n            if word == word[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(word)\n    return palindromes\n```\nThe `palindromes_between_indices` function takes one argument, which is a string. It first extracts the substring from index 1 to index 9 and converts it to lowercase. It then initializes an empty set to store the palindromes. The function then iterates over all possible lengths of the palindromes, from 7 to the length of the substring. For each length, it generates all possible permutations of the substring using the `itertools.permutations` function. It then checks if each permutation is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If the permutation is a palindrome, it adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
