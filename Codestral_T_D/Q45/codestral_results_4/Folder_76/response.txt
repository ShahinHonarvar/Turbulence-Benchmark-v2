The function takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length at least 4 that can be created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 1 to index 4, both inclusive. The function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function returns an empty set.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
