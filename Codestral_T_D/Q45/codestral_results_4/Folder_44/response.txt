Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    from itertools import permutations\n    string = string[2:8].lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(3, len(string) + 1):\n        perms = permutations(string, i)\n        for perm in perms:\n            word = ''.join(perm)\n            if word == word[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(word)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length at least 3 that can be created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 2 to index 7, both inclusive. The function converts the string to lowercase and then generates all possible permutations of the substring. It checks if each permutation is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If a palindrome is found, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the set of palindromes is returned. If no palindromes are found, an empty set is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
