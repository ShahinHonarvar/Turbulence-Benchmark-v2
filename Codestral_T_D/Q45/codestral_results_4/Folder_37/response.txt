I will define a function called 'palindromes_between_indices' that takes a string as input. The function will return a set of all palindromes of length at least 5 that can be created from the English letters in the given string that occur between index 1 to index 4 (both inclusive). If no such palindromes can be created, the function will return an empty set. All palindromes will be formed in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this function.\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    from itertools import permutations\n    s = s[1:5].lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for l in range(5, len(s) + 1):\n        for perm in permutations(s, l):\n            word = ''.join(perm)\n            if word == word[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(word)\n    return palindromes\n```\nI have written the Python function 'palindromes_between_indices' as per your requirements.
