Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    s = s[1:9].lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(7, len(s) + 1):\n        for perm in permutations(s, i):\n            word = ''.join(perm)\n            if word == word[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(word)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as input, extracts the characters between index 1 and index 8 (both inclusive), and converts them to lowercase. It then generates all possible permutations of the characters and checks if each permutation is a palindrome. If a palindrome is found, it is added to a set. Finally, the function returns the set of all palindromes that have a length of at least 7.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
