The function finds all the palindromes of length at least 3 that can be created from the English letters in the given string that occur between indices 1 to 7 (both inclusive).\n\nThe function returns a set of all the palindromes found. If no such palindromes are found, the function returns an empty set. The function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    s = s[1:8].lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for r in range(3, len(s) + 1):\n        for p in permutations(s, r):\n            if p == p[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(''.join(p))\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nYou can call the 'palindromes_between_indices' function with a string as an argument to find all the palindromes of length at least 3 that can be created from the English letters in the string that occur between indices 1 to 7.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
