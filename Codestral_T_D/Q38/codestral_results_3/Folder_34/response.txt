This function takes a set of elements as input and returns the number of all subsets of size 97. It does this by using the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module. This function generates all possible combinations of elements in the set of a given length. In this case, we're looking for combinations of length 97. The `len` function is then used to count the number of these combinations, which is returned as the output of the function.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
