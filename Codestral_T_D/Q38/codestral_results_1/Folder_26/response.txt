This function calculates the number of all subsets of size 25 from the input set using the combination formula.\n\nSince calculating the combination of a large set and a large number can be computationally expensive, it is recommended to use a more efficient algorithm, such as the one provided by the `math` module in Python, which computes combinations more efficiently.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it and passing your set as an argument. The function will return the number of all subsets of size 25 from the input set.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
