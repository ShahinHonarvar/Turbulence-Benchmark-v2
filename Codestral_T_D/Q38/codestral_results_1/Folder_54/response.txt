To do this, we can use the combination formula which is `nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)`, where `n` is the total number of elements and `r` is the size of the subset we want to find. However, calculating factorials for large numbers can lead to inaccurate results due to floating point precision. Therefore, the `math.comb` function from Python's `math` module will be used instead, which calculates combinations accurately even for large numbers.\n\nHere's the Python code for your requirement:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(s):\n    return math.comb(len(s), 51)\n```", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
