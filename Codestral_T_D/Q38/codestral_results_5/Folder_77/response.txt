However, the task of finding all subsets of size 360 from a set isn't feasible if the size of the set is less than 360. If you meant to find all subsets of size n, where n is less than the size of the set, I can do that. Here's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(s, n):\n    return len(list(combinations(s, n)))\n```\n\nThis function uses the 'combinations' function from the 'itertools' module to generate all subsets of size 'n' from the input set 's'. It then returns the length of this list, which is the number of subsets.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
