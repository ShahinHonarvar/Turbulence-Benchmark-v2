In this case, n is 860.\n\nTo calculate the number of subsets of size n from a set with m elements, we can use the combination formula: C(m, n) = m! / (n! * (m-n)!), where '!' denotes factorial. However, for large values of m and n, this formula can lead to large numbers and potential overflow.\n\nIn this scenario, since we are only interested in the count of subsets and not the actual subsets, we can use the 'combinations' function from the 'itertools' module in Python, which is more efficient and can handle large numbers.\n\nHere is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(s, n):\n    return len(list(itertools.combinations(s, n)))\n```\n\nIn this code, 's' is the set of elements and 'n' is the size of the subsets. The function 'itertools.combinations' generates all possible combinations of 'n' elements from the set 's', and 'len' is used to count the number of these combinations.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
