Here's a Python function that uses the combinations function from the itertools module to find all subsets of size 27 from a given set. It returns the length of the list of these combinations, which is the number of such subsets.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(s):\n    return len(list(combinations(s, 27)))\n```\n\nThis function will work as long as the size of the input set is greater than or equal to 27. If the size of the input set is less than 27, the function will return 0, since there are no subsets of size 27.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
