Here's a Python function that uses the `itertools.combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of a given set with a specific length. In this case, the length is 66. The function then returns the length of the list of all these subsets, which is the number of subsets of size 66.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(s):\n    return len(list(itertools.combinations(s, 66)))\n```\n\nThis function will work as long as the size of the input set is greater than or equal to 66. If the size of the input set is less than 66, the function will return 0, because there are no subsets of size 66.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
