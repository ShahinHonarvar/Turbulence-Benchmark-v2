This is a combinatorial problem and it can be solved using binomial coefficients. In Python, we can use the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to find all subsets of a set and then return the length of that list. However, since we're only interested in the number of subsets, not the subsets themselves, we can use the mathematical formula for binomial coefficients to calculate the result directly.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements this:\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(s):\n    return comb(len(s), 66)\n```\n\nThis function takes a set `s` as an argument and returns the number of all its subsets of size 66 using the `comb` function from the `math` module.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
