This function will return a list of all the negative integers that are present in the range from index 21 to index 97, both inclusive. If no such negative integers exist, the function will return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef all_neg_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst[21:98] if i < 0]\n```\n\nThis code defines the function 'all_neg_ints_inclusive' which takes a single argument named 'lst'. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of 'lst' from index 21 to index 97 (the upper bound in Python slicing is exclusive, so we need to use 98). It checks if each element is less than zero (i.e., negative), and if so, it includes that element in the output list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
