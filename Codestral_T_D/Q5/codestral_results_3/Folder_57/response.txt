Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef all_neg_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst[27:56] if i < 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the list from index 27 to 56 (the end index in Python is exclusive, so we need to go up to 56 to include index 55), and it only includes elements that are less than 0 (i.e., negative integers). If no such elements exist, the function will return an empty list.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
