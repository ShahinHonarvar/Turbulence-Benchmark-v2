Here's a simple Python function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```python\ndef all_neg_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst[91:100] if i < 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the list from index 91 to 100 (the end index in Python is exclusive, so we use 100 to include the 99th index). It then checks if each integer is less than 0, which means it's negative. If the integer is negative, it's included in the new list. If no negative integers are found, an empty list is returned.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
