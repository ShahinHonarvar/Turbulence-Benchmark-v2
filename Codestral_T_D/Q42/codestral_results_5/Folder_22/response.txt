Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for. This function first defines a helper function to find the prime factors of a single number, and then it uses this helper function to find the prime factors of the number at index 72 in the input list.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def get_factors(n):\n        i = 2\n        factors = set()\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i:\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                n //= i\n                factors.add(i)\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    return get_factors(numbers[72])\n```\n\nThis function works by starting with the smallest prime number, 2, and repeatedly dividing the input number by this value until it can no longer be divided evenly. It then increments the value and repeats the process. This continues until the value is greater than the square root of the input number, at which point any remaining factor must be a prime number. The function returns a set of all the prime factors it finds.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
