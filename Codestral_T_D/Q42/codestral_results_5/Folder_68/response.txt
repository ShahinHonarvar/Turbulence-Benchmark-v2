If `i` divides the number, `i` is added to the set of factors and the number is divided by `i`. This is done until `i * i` is greater than the number, at which point if the number is greater than 1, it is added to the set of factors as the last prime factor.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
