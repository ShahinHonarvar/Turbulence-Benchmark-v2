Here's a simple Python function that should do the trick. This function first defines a helper function to find the prime factors of a single number, and then uses that function to find the prime factors of the 35th number in the input list.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(lst):\n    def factors(n):\n        i = 2\n        factors = set()\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i:\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                n //= i\n                factors.add(i)\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    return factors(lst[35])\n```\n\nThis function works by iteratively dividing the number by the smallest possible factor (starting from 2) until it can no longer be divided evenly. The factors that are used in this process are the prime factors of the number. The function uses a set to store the factors, which automatically handles duplicates and ensures that the output is a set (as required by the problem statement).", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
