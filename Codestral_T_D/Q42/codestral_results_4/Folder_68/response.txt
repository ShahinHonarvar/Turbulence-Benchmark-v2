If it is divisible, the current integer is added to the set of prime factors and the number is divided by the current integer. This process is repeated until the number is no longer divisible by the current integer, and the integer is incremented by 1. If the number remains greater than 1 after the loop, it is added to the set of prime factors. Finally, the set of prime factors is returned.\n\nYou can now use this function to find the set of prime factors of the integer at index 3 of any list of positive integers.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
