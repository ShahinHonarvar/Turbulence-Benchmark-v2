It starts with the smallest prime number, 2, and checks if it is a factor of the number. If it is, the number is divided by 2 and the process is repeated. If it is not, the number is checked with the next higher prime number. This continues until the number is reduced to 1. All the prime numbers used in this process are collected in a set and returned.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
