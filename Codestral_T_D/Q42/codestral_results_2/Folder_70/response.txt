Here's a simple Python function that should do the trick. It uses a helper function to find the prime factors of a number:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def find_factors(n):\n        i = 2\n        factors = set()\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i:\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                n //= i\n                factors.add(i)\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    return find_factors(numbers[845])\n```\n\nThis function works by starting from 2 and checking if it's a factor of the number. If it is, it adds it to the set of factors and divides the number by the factor. It then repeats this process with the updated number and the same factor, until it's no longer a factor. It then increments the factor and repeats the process. This continues until the factor is greater than the square root of the number, at which point it adds any remaining factor to the set.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
