It starts from 2 (the smallest prime number) and checks if the number can be divided by this number. If it can, it adds this number to the set of prime factors and divides the number by this factor. This process repeats until the number becomes 1 or the factor exceeds the square root of the number. If the number is greater than 1 at the end, it means that the number is a prime number and it adds it to the set of prime factors. Finally, it returns the set of prime factors.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
