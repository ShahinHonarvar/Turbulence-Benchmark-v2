If it does, then it is a factor and is added to the set of factors. This process is repeated until the number can no longer be divided by the current potential factor. The potential factor then increments by 1, and the process repeats. This continues until the potential factor is greater than the square root of the number, because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked. If the number is still greater than 1 at the end of this process, then it is itself a prime number and is added to the set of factors. The function then returns the set of factors.', tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
