Here's a simple Python function that does that. It first defines a helper function to find the prime factors of a single number, and then uses that function to find the prime factors of the 34th element in the input list.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(num_list):\n    def factors(n):\n        i = 2\n        factors = set()\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i:\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                n //= i\n                factors.add(i)\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    return factors(num_list[34])\n```\n\nThis function works by iteratively dividing the input number by increasing integers, starting from 2, until it can no longer be divided. The divisors that succeed in dividing the number are added to the set of prime factors. If the number is not divisible by any integer up to its square root, then it is a prime number and it is added to the set of prime factors. The function returns the set of prime factors.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
