Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for. It defines a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime, and then it uses this function to find all prime factors of the integer at index 828 in the given list.\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def is_prime(n):\n        if n < 2:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    factors = set()\n    num = numbers[828]\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        while num % i == 0 and is_prime(i):\n            factors.add(i)\n            num //= i\n    if num > 1 and is_prime(num):\n        factors.add(num)\n    return factors\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all numbers up to the square root of the input number, checking if they are prime and if they divide the input number. If they do, they are added to the set of factors, and the input number is divided by this factor. This process is repeated until the input number is 1 or a prime number, which is then added to the set of factors if it is greater than 1.", tool_calls=None, prefix=False, role='assistant'), finish_reason='stop')]
