Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289]


The correct answer was:

[223, 197, 173, 167, 137, 113, 97, 83, 73, 67, 53, 47, 43, 37, 23, 17, 13, 7, 5, 3, 2]

But the LLM code returned:
[239, 238, 237, 236, 235, 234, 233, 232, 231, 230, 79, 78, 77, 76, 75, 74, 73, 72, 71, 70, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 7, 5, 3, 2]
