Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758, 622, 258, 910, 982]


The correct answer was:

[467, 443, 397, 383, 373, 367, 353, 347, 337, 317, 313, 283, 223, 197, 173, 167, 137, 113, 97, 83, 73, 67, 53, 47, 43, 37, 23, 17, 13, 7, 5, 3, 2]

But the LLM code returned:
[379, 378, 377, 376, 375, 374, 373, 372, 371, 370, 319, 318, 317, 316, 315, 314, 313, 312, 311, 310, 299, 298, 297, 296, 295, 294, 293, 292, 291, 290, 239, 238, 237, 236, 235, 234, 233, 232, 231, 230, 79, 78, 77, 76, 75, 74, 73, 72, 71, 70, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 7, 5, 3, 2]
