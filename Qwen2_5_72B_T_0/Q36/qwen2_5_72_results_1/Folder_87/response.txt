However, the original problem statement might be interpreted in a way that only characters between the 32nd and 61st positions (1-based index) are considered for removal if they meet the condition. If the latter interpretation is correct, the solution would need to be adjusted. Here is an adjusted version:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(32, 61):\n        if 32 < i < 61 and '3' < s[i] < 'D':\n            to_remove.add(s[i])\n    result = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in to_remove])\n    return result\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, name=None))], created=1730458060, model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=216, prompt_tokens=151, total_tokens=367, estimated_cost=0.00013925))
