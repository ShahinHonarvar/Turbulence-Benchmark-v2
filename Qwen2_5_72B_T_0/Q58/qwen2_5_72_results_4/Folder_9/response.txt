However, since 33 is a prime number, the only possible submatrices are 1x33 or 33x1. The function provided might need adjustments based on the exact requirement for the dimensions of the submatrices. For a more specific solution, the size parameter in `count_submatrices_of_size` should be set according to the expected dimensions that would contain exactly 33 elements.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, name=None))], created=1730512584, model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=251, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=378, estimated_cost=0.00014485))
