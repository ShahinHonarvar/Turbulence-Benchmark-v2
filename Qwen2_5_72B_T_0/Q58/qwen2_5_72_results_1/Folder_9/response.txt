However, since 33 is a prime number, the only possible submatrices are 1x33 or 33x1. The function provided might need adjustments based on the exact requirement for the shape of the submatrix (e.g., only considering square submatrices or both rectangular shapes).', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, name=None))], created=1730510606, model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=229, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=356, estimated_cost=0.00013605))
