Since 21 is a prime number, the only way to form a submatrix with exactly 21 elements is if the submatrix is not square, specifically of dimensions 1x21 or 21x1. The function has been adjusted to reflect this by checking for the presence of 21 in the matrix and then counting 1x21 or 21x1 submatrices. If the requirement is strictly for square submatrices, the function would always return 0 for a target of 21 elements, as 21 cannot be formed by the product of two equal integers.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, name=None))], created=1730510698, model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=274, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=401, estimated_cost=0.00015405))
