It first checks if the input is a numpy array. If not, it converts it to one.\n2. It gets the dimensions of the matrix.\n3. It then uses nested loops to iterate over all possible submatrices.\n4. For each submatrix, it checks if its size (number of elements) is exactly 24.\n5. If a submatrix with 24 elements is found, the count is incremented.\n6. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 24 elements.\n\nIf no submatrix with 24 elements is found, the function will return 0 as the count will not be incremented.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=125, output_tokens=337))
