It first checks if the input is a numpy array, and if not, converts it to one.\n2. It then gets the dimensions of the matrix.\n3. It iterates through all possible submatrices of the given matrix.\n4. For each submatrix, it checks if its size is exactly 63.\n5. If a submatrix with 63 elements is found, it increments the count.\n6. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 63 elements.\n\nIf no submatrix with 63 elements is found, the function will return 0 as the count will not be incremented.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=125, output_tokens=332))
