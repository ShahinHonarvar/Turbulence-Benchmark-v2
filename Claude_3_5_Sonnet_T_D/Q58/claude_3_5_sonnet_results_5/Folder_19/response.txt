It first checks if the input is a numpy array, and if not, converts it to one.\n2. It then gets the dimensions of the matrix.\n3. It initializes a counter to keep track of the number of submatrices with 17 integers.\n4. It uses nested loops to iterate through all possible submatrices.\n5. For each submatrix, it checks if its size is 17.\n6. If a submatrix with 17 integers is found, the counter is incremented.\n7. Finally, it returns the count of submatrices with 17 integers.\n\nNote that this function will return 0 if no submatrix with exactly 17 integers is found.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=125, output_tokens=348))
