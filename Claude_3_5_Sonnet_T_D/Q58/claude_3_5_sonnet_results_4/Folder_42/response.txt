It takes a 2D numpy matrix of integers as input.\n2. It iterates through all possible submatrices of the input matrix.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements (product of its dimensions) is equal to 193.\n4. If a submatrix with 193 elements is found, it increments the count.\n5. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 193 elements.\n\nIf no submatrix with 193 elements is found, the function will return 0 as the count remains unchanged.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=125, output_tokens=310))
