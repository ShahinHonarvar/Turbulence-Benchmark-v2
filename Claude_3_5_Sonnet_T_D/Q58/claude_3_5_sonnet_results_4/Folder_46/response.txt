It takes a 2D numpy matrix as input.\n2. It calculates all possible submatrices of the given matrix.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the size (number of elements) is equal to 144.\n4. If a submatrix with 144 elements is found, it increments the count.\n5. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 144 elements.\n\nIf no submatrix with 144 elements is found, the function will return 0 as the count will remain unchanged.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=125, output_tokens=289))
