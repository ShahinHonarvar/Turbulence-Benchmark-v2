It takes a 2D numpy matrix as input.\n2. It calculates all possible submatrices of the input matrix.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements is 8.\n4. If a submatrix has exactly 8 elements, it increments the count.\n5. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 8 elements.\n\nIf no submatrix with 8 elements is found, the function will return 0 as the count will remain unchanged.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=125, output_tokens=289))
