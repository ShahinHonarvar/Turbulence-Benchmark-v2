It imports the numpy library and converts the input matrix to a numpy array.\n2. It gets the dimensions of the matrix (rows and columns).\n3. It initializes a counter variable to keep track of the number of submatrices with 64 integers.\n4. It uses nested loops to iterate through all possible submatrices of the given matrix.\n5. For each submatrix, it checks if its size (number of elements) is exactly 64.\n6. If a submatrix with 64 elements is found, the counter is incremented.\n7. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 64 integers.\n\nIf no submatrix with 64 integers is found, the function will return 0 as the count will not be incremented.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=125, output_tokens=349))
