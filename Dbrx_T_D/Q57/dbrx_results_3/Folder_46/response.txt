In this function, we are iterating over all possible submatrices by selecting different starting and ending rows and columns. For each submatrix, we are checking if the sum of all integers in the submatrix is equal to 416. If it is, we are adding the submatrix to the list of submatrices. If no such submatrix is found, we are returning an empty list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730367999, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=228, prompt_tokens=136, total_tokens=364), provider='Together')
