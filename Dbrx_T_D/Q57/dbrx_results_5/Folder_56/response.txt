The function iterates over all possible submatrices and checks if the sum of its elements equals -50. If it does, the submatrix is added to the list of submatrices.\n\nIt's important to note that the function uses the numpy library to create and manipulate the matrix, so it needs to be installed before running the code.\n\nAlso, the function returns an empty list if no submatrix with a sum of -50 is found. This is done by checking if the list of submatrices is empty after the nested loops.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the function has a time complexity of O(n^4) where n is the number of rows/columns of the matrix, due to the 4 nested loops. This means that the function can be slow for large matrices.\n\nFinally, the function does not return any duplicate submatrices, if there are any, it will only return one of them.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730368499, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=339, prompt_tokens=136, total_tokens=475), provider='Together')
