The range of rows and columns can be represented by two intervals, `[i, k]` and `[j, l]`, respectively. The resulting submatrix, `matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]`, includes all elements in the rows from `i` to `k` and the columns from `j` to `l`.\n\nSubmatrices with a sum of -82\n----------------------------\n\nThe function uses nested loops to iterate through all possible submatrices in the given matrix. For each submatrix, the function calculates the sum of its elements and compares it to -82. If the sum is equal to -82, the submatrix is added to the `submatrices` list. After all submatrices have been checked, the function returns the `submatrices` list. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730368454, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=363, prompt_tokens=136, total_tokens=499), provider='Together')
