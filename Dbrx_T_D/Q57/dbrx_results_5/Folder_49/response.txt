The function uses for loops to iterate over all possible submatrices of the input matrix and checks if the sum of elements in the submatrix equals -42. If it does, the submatrix is appended to the list of submatrices. At the end of the function, the list of submatrices is returned. If no such submatrix is found, an empty list is returned.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730368482, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=225, prompt_tokens=136, total_tokens=361), provider='Together')
