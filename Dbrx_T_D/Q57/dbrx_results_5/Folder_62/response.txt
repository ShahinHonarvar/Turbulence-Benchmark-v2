The function `submatrix_with_particular_sum` first initializes an empty list to store the submatrices that meet the condition. Then, it iterates over all possible starting positions in the matrix and all possible sizes of submatrices that can be obtained from each starting position. For each possible submatrix, it checks whether the sum of all integers in it is equal to 394. If it is, the submatrix is appended to the list. Finally, the function returns the list of all submatrices that meet the condition. If no such submatrix is found, an empty list is returned.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730368522, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=247, prompt_tokens=136, total_tokens=383), provider='Together')
