The function returns the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -25. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe function uses nested loops to iterate through the given matrix and find all possible submatrices. For each submatrix, the sum of its elements is calculated and compared to -25. If the sum is equal to -25, the submatrix is added to the list of submatrices. After checking all possible submatrices, the function returns the list of submatrices with a sum of -25.\n\nThe function uses the numpy library to handle the two-dimensional matrix and calculate the sum of its elements. The function does not contain any comments, and it is delimited by triple backticks.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730368370, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=313, prompt_tokens=136, total_tokens=449), provider='Together')
