By using the numpy library, we can easily create a function that returns all submatrices of the given matrix with a sum of -3. The function uses four nested loops to iterate over all possible submatrices of the input matrix, and checks if the sum of all integers in the submatrix equals -3. If it does, the submatrix is added to the list of submatrices to be returned. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe numpy library provides the `numpy.sum()` function, which calculates the sum of all elements in a numpy matrix or array. This function is used here to calculate the sum of all elements in each submatrix. The `numpy.shape()` function is used to get the dimensions of the input matrix, which are used to determine the bounds of the nested loops.\n\nThe function `submatrix_with_particular_sum()` takes one argument, which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function returns the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -3. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730368348, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=363, prompt_tokens=136, total_tokens=499), provider='Together')
