Out of 3 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 2 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19]


The correct answer was:

28

But the LLM code returned:
1E

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

(0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17)

======================================================================================================================================================

(3) Test input:

(0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
