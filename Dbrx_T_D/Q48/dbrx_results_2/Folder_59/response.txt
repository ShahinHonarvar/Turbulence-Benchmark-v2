If `sum` is odd, its binary representation is returned as a string; otherwise, its hexadecimal representation is returned as a string.\n* The binary representation does not have the prefix `0b`, and the hexadecimal representation does not have the prefix `0x`.\n* The binary and hexadecimal representations start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n* If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730355900, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=362, prompt_tokens=278, total_tokens=640), provider='Together')
