Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 43, 47, 48, 50, 52, 61, 62, 64, 67, 69, 75, 83, 84, 89, 90, 92, 95, 97, 98, 104, 107, 110, 112, 115, 118, 120, 123, 127, 130, 132, 135, 136, 137, 138, 144, 145, 146, 148, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 161, 164, 169, 170, 171, 172, 175, 179, 180, 183, 184, 186, 187, 189, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 203, 204, 208, 213, 215, 218, 219, 221, 224, 225, 226, 228, 229, 230, 233, 234, 236, 238, 240, 243, 244, 245, 248, 251, 253, 254, 255, 259, 262, 265]


The correct answer was:

1608

But the LLM code returned:
0x1606
