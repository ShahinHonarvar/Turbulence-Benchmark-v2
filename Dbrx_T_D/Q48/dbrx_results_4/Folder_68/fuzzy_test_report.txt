Out of 3 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 2 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 34, 35]


The correct answer was:

1100011

But the LLM code returned:
01100011

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

(0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 28, 32, 33)

(3) Test input:

(0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 21, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35)
