This law can be expressed mathematically as:\n\na = F/m\n\nwhere:\n\n* a is the acceleration of the object\n* F is the net force acting on the object\n* m is the mass of the object\n\nThis law explains how the motion of an object is affected by the forces acting on it and its mass. It also implies that a larger force is required to change the motion of a more massive object, and a smaller force is sufficient to change the motion of a less massive object. This concept is fundamental to classical mechanics and has numerous applications in physics and engineering.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730312754, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=243, prompt_tokens=120, total_tokens=363), provider='Together')
