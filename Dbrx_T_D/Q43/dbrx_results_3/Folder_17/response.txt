Finally, the function sorts the list in descending order and returns it. If the range does not contain any prime numbers, an empty list is returned.\n\nIt is important to note that the function expects a list of integers with a length of at least 49, otherwise it will raise an IndexError. If the list is not long enough, it will still run but will not find any prime numbers in the range.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730349993, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=224, prompt_tokens=133, total_tokens=357), provider='Together')
