If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It first initializes three variables: `divisors`, `current_divisor`, and `n`.\n2. It then enters a while loop, where it checks if `n` is divisible by `current_divisor`.\n3. If `n` is not divisible by `current_divisor`, it increments `current_divisor` by 1.\n4. If `n` is divisible by `current_divisor`, it updates `n` to be `n // current_divisor`, and adds both `current_divisor` and `n` to the set `divisors`.\n5. Once the while loop is done, it adds `current_divisor` to the set `divisors` if it's not already in it.\n6. Finally, it returns the sum of all elements in `divisors` that are between 46 and 65, both inclusive.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)), as the while loop runs until `current_divisor * current_divisor` is greater than `n`. The space complexity is O(sqrt(n)), as the size of the set `divisors` is bounded by the number of divisors of `n`, which is at most O(sqrt(n)).", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730323050, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=413, prompt_tokens=128, total_tokens=541), provider='Together')
