If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe function uses a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 35 to 37, both inclusive. For each number in this range, it checks if `n` is divisible by the number by using the modulus operator `%`. If `n` is divisible by the number, it adds the number to the list of divisors. Finally, it returns the list of divisors.\n\nFor example, if `n` is 120, the function returns `[35, 36]`, which are the numbers between 35 and 37 that divide 120. If `n` is 123, the function returns `[35]`, which is the only number between 35 and 37 that divides 123. If `n` is 37, the function returns `[37]`, which is the only number between 35 and 37 that divides 37. If `n` is not divisible by any number between 35 and 37, the function returns an empty list `[]`.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730321353, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=316, prompt_tokens=128, total_tokens=444), provider='Together')
