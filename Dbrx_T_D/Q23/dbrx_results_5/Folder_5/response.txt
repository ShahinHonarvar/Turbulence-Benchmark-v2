If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.\n\nThe function first creates an empty list `divisors` to store the divisors that are within the range. It then uses a for loop to iterate through the range between 7 and 8 (inclusive). For each value of `i` in this range, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i` by checking if the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is equal to 0. If `n` is divisible by `i`, `i` is appended to the `divisors` list.\n\nAfter checking all the values in the range, the function returns the `divisors` list, which contains the divisors of `n` that are within the range between 7 and 8, both inclusive.
