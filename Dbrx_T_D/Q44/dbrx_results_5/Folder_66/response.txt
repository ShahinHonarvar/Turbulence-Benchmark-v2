If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty set.\n\nThe function first creates a set `composite_numbers` to store the composite numbers in the specified range. It then checks if a number is composite by checking if it is greater than 1 and if it is not divisible by any number less than itself. The `all` function is used to check if all the numbers from 2 to `num` are not divisible by `num`. If this condition is satisfied, then `num` is a composite number and is added to the `composite_numbers` set.\n\nFinally, the `composite_numbers` set is returned as the output of the function.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730351517, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=231, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=362), provider='Together')
