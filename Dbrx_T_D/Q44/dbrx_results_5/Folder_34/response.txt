A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The function checks if a number is a prime number by checking if it is not divisible by any number less than its square root. The function also checks if the index of the number is between 70 and 200, both inclusive. If the index is out of range, the function skips that index and continues with the next one. The function returns the set of all composite numbers in the specified range. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty set.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730351443, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=286, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=417), provider='Together')
