Here's the Python code for the given specification:\n```\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(numbers):\n    composite_numbers = set(filter(lambda x: x > 1 and x % 2 != 0 and x % 3 != 0, numbers[29:52]))\n    for num in list(composite_numbers):\n        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                composite_numbers.remove(num)\n                break\n    return composite_numbers\n```\nThis Python function `composite_nums_between_indices` takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the set of all composite numbers in the list that are between index 29 to index 51, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty set. The function uses a lambda function and the built-in `filter` function to filter out composite numbers from the given list, and then checks if each composite number is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root to ensure that only composite numbers are included in the set.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730351503, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=252, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=383), provider='Together')
