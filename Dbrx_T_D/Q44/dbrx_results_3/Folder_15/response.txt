In the function above, we check if a number is composite by testing if it is divisible by its previous two numbers. If it is, then it is not composite and we move on to the next number. If it is not divisible by its previous two numbers, then it is a composite number and we add it to the set.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730351008, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=172, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=303), provider='Together')
