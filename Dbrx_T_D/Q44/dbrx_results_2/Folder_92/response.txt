The function first checks if the length of the list is less than 2, in which case it returns an empty set. Otherwise, it uses a set comprehension to create a set of composite numbers between index 1 and index 1 (both inclusive) based on the given list. The set comprehension checks if a number is greater than 1 and not a prime number (by checking if it is divisible by any number from 2 to the number itself).', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730350968, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=181, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=312), provider='Together')
