For each index, the function checks if the index is within the bounds of the list and if the number is a composite number (not divisible by 2 and greater than 1). If the number meets these conditions, it is added to the `result` set. Finally, the function returns the `result` set, which contains all the composite numbers between the indices `70` to `84` (both inclusive).\n\nNote: The function assumes that the input list is not empty and that the indices between `70` to `84` are valid indices in the list. If any of these conditions are not met, the function may raise an `IndexError`.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730350937, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=246, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=377), provider='Together')
