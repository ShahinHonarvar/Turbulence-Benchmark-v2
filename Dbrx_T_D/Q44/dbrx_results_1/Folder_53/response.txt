In the above code, I am assuming that the numbers are greater than 1 and even, since those are the most common non-trivial composite numbers. If you require a more accurate definition of composite numbers, please let me know. Also, the current implementation only checks from index 222 to 223 (both inclusive), as specified in the prompt. If you meant to check from index 222 to 222, the range should be `numbers[222:223+1]` instead.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730350709, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=173, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=304), provider='Together')
