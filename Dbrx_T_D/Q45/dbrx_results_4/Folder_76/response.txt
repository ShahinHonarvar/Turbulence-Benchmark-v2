The function uses a bitmask to iterate through all possible subsets of English letters in the given range and forms a palindrome by arranging the selected letters in a way that starts with the first letter and ends with the last letter. The function also checks if the palindrome is not formed by repeating a shorter palindrome and if it is still a valid palindrome if it is formed by repeating a shorter palindrome. The function returns an empty set if no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range. The function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730352868, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=570, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=767), provider='Together')
