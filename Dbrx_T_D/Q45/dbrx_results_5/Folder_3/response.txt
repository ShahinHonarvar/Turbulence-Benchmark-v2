The `is_palindrome` function checks if a given string is a palindrome and has a length of at least 3. The `palindromes_between_indices` function extracts the English letters that occur in the specified range (7 to 9, both inclusive) from the input string, then returns a set of all palindromes of the length of at least 3 created from any possible arrangement of those letters in a case-insensitive manner. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function returns an empty set.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730352961, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=322, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=519), provider='Together')
