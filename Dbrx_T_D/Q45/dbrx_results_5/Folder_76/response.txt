It first extracts the English letters from the specified range and forms each letter into a string. Then, it creates a defaultdict of lists to store the indices of each unique letter. If there are at least 2 indices for a letter, it checks if the difference between each pair of indices is 1, which means they are adjacent. If so, it forms a palindrome from the substring of those indices and adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.\n\nNote: The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) where n is the length of the string, because of the nested loop used to check for adjacent indices. The space complexity is O(n) because of the additional space required for the defaultdict and the set of palindromes.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730353211, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=351, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=548), provider='Together')
