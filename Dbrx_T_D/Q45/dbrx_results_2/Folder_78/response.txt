It then checks if the length of the extracted substring is at least 3, and if not, it returns an empty set. If the length of the extracted substring is at least 3, the function then iterates over all possible substrings of the extracted substring of length at least 3 and at most the length of the extracted substring. For each candidate palindrome, the function checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse, and if so, it adds the candidate palindrome to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730352171, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=522, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=719), provider='Together')
