It then iterates over each English letter in `chars` and for each letter, it iterates over the range from its index to the minimum of 10 and the length of the string plus 1. For each character in this range, it checks if the character is in `chars` and in the set of English letters. If it is, it adds a new palindrome to `chars` for that letter by concatenating the current character with the substring of the given string from the index of the first character in the palindrome to the index of the current character. It then filters the palindromes in `chars` for the given letter to only include those that can be created in a case-insensitive manner. Finally, it returns the set of all palindromes in `chars` that have a length greater than 1.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the given string contains at least one English letter in the specified range. If this is not the case, an empty set will be returned.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730351906, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=435, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=632), provider='Together')
