Then, for each pair of indices (i, j) in the range of 0 to 7, it extracts the substring between these indices. If the length of the substring is at least 4, and the substring is a palindrome (i.e., it is equal to its reverse), and all characters in the substring are English letters, the function adds the substring to the result. Finally, the function returns the result.\nTo use the function, you can call it with a string as an argument:\n```python\nresult = find_palindromes_in_range("Hello, World!")\nprint(result)\n```\nThis will output the set of all palindromes of length at least 4 that can be formed from the English letters in the string "Hello, World!" that occur between index 0 to index 7, both inclusive. In this case, the output will be an empty set, because there are no such palindromes in the string.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730351916, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=316, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=513), provider='Together')
