Then, it forms all possible combinations of two English letters from the extracted letters. For each combination, it calculates the number of times the first and second letters appear in the extracted letters. Then, it generates all possible palindromes of length at least 4 by repeating the first and second letters and adding a substring between them, while the number of repetitions of the first and second letters is less than or equal to their count in the extracted letters. If the generated palindrome is equal to its reverse, it is added to the result set. Finally, the function returns the result set.\n\n```", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730352014, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=371, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=568), provider='Together')
