If the given string does not contain any letter in this range, the function will raise a `KeyError`. To avoid this, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the given string contains at least one letter in the specified range.\n\nAlso, the function assumes that the English letters in the given string are to be grouped based on their identity, regardless of their case. This means that the function will group 'a' and 'A' together, for example. If you want to group the letters based on their case, you can modify the `group_by_letter` function accordingly.\n\nFinally, the function returns a set of palindromes, which means that there will be no duplicate palindromes in the result. If you want to allow duplicate palindromes, you can modify the function to return a list instead of a set.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730352025, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=389, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=586), provider='Together')
