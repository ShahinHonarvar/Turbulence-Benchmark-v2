The function first initializes a set of English letters and an empty set to store the palindromes. Then, it iterates over all possible substrings of the input string `s` that fall within the specified range. For each substring, it converts all the characters to lowercase and filters out the non-English letters. If the resulting substring is of length at least 3 and is a palindrome (i.e., it is equal to its reverse), it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nNote that this function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner, as specified. This means that if a palindrome can be formed using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, it will still be considered a palindrome.\n```", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730351929, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=338, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=535), provider='Together')
