The function first extracts the relevant substring and converts it to lowercase. Then, it counts the occurrences of each character in the substring. Next, the function iterates over all possible substrings of the extracted substring, from length 1 to the length of the substring. For each substring, it checks if it is possible to form a palindrome by using only characters from the substring. If it is possible, the function constructs the palindrome and adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nNote: The function uses a defaultdict to count the occurrences of each character in the substring. A defaultdict is a dictionary that returns a default value when a key is not found. In this case, the default value is 0. This simplifies the code by eliminating the need to check if a character is already in the dictionary before incrementing its count.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730352064, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=399, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=596), provider='Together')
