The function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner. If no such palindromes can be created, the function returns an empty set.\n\nThe function first defines the set of English letters and initializes an empty set for storing the palindromes. It then iterates over all possible substrings of the given string that fall within the specified range. For each substring, it converts it to lowercase and creates a deque of English letters, removing any letters that appear in the substring.\n\nThe function then iterates over the deque, popping letters from the front and appending them to the back until the deque is empty. At each step, it checks if the current sequence of letters forms a palindrome and if the set of letters in the palindrome is the same as the set of letters in the substring. If both conditions are satisfied, the palindrome is added to the set.\n\nFinally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nNote that this function uses a brute-force approach to check for palindromes and may not be efficient for large inputs. If performance is a concern, a more efficient algorithm can be used.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730352535, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=436, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=633), provider='Together')
