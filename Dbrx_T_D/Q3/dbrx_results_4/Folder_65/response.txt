If the length of the list is less than 98, it means that the range of 56 to 98 is not present in the list, so the function returns an empty list. If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 98, it means that the range of 56 to 98 is present in the list, so the function returns a slice of the list from index 55 to 98 (inclusive). If the length of the list is less than 98 but greater than or equal to 56, it means that the range of 56 to 98 is partly present in the list, so the function returns a slice of the list from the last 49 elements.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730305674, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=243, prompt_tokens=124, total_tokens=367), provider='Together')
