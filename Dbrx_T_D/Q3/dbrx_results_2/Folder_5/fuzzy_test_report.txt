Out of 3 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 2 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-204, 332, -377, -116, -363, 189, 81, -477, 255, -35, -226]


The correct answer was:

[255]

But the LLM code returned:
[]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

[448, 283, 12, 91, -217, 312, -26, 5, -88, -266, -105]

======================================================================================================================================================

(3) Test input:

[449, 464, 370, -358, -28, 417, -309, -121, -421, -492, 227]
