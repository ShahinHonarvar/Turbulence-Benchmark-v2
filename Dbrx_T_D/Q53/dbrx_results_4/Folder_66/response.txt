To find all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 76, we can iterate over all substrings of the given string with length greater than or equal to 76. For each substring, we check if it is a palindrome and if it consists only of English letters. If both conditions are satisfied, we add the substring to the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function uses a set to store the palindromes to ensure that there are no duplicates. The function also converts the given string to lowercase to find palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nTo handle the case where no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function returns an empty set.\n\nThe function uses the `isalpha()` method to check if a string consists only of English letters. This method returns `True` if all the characters in the string are alphabetic characters, and `False` otherwise. The function also uses the `lower()` method to convert the given string to lowercase. This method returns a copy of the original string converted to lowercase. The function also uses the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers that can be used to iterate over the substrings of the given string. The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from a start number to an end number, with a specified step size. In this case, the start number is the index of the first character of the substring, the end number is the index of the last character of the substring, and the step size is 1. The function also uses the `[::-1]` slicing notation to get the reverse of a string. This notation can be used to get a slice of a string with a specified step size. In this case, the step size is -1, which means that the slice is in reverse order.\n\nNote: The use of the `isalpha()` method is required because the problem statement specifies that the palindromes should only consist of English letters. If the problem statement allowed for palindromes that contain other characters, such as spaces or punctuation, then the `isalpha()` method would not be necessary.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730362648, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=546, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=704), provider='Together')
