The set of palindromes is generated by iterating over the acceptable lengths, the start indices within the specified index range, and then checking if the substring is a palindrome and if it consists only of English letters. The palindrome check is done by comparing the substring with its reverse. The English letter check is done by comparing the set of characters in the palindrome with the set of English letters. The result is a set of unique, case-insensitive palindromes with the specified lengths found in the given index range. If no such palindrome is found, an empty set is returned.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730355085, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=209, prompt_tokens=205, total_tokens=414), provider='Together')
