It does this by iterating through the possible lengths and indices, checking if the substring is a palindrome (by comparing it to its reverse), and if it is a palindrome, adding it to the set if it consists only of English letters.\n\nIt's worth noting that the function does not check if the substring is a palindrome if it contains non-alphabetic characters, as the prompt specifies that only palindromes consisting of English letters should be considered.\n\nIt also uses the `lower()` method to make the function case-insensitive.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730354536, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=252, prompt_tokens=205, total_tokens=457), provider='Together')
