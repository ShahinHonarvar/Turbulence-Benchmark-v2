However, if the input list is large, then creating a sublist and sorting it can be expensive. In that case, a more efficient approach would be to use a priority queue to find the 9th smallest number. But I have not included that in my answer as the input is a list of distinct numbers and the range is from 105 to 254, which should not be too large for the sort method.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730318650, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=148, prompt_tokens=109, total_tokens=257), provider='Together')
