The function should ignore case and punctuations.>\n\nTo write a function that counts the occurrences of each word in a given string, ignoring case and punctuations, you can use the `str.split()` method to split the string into words, and then use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each word. You can use the `str.lower()` method to ignore case, and the `str.translate()` method with the `str.maketrans()` method to remove punctuations.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement the `count_words` function:\n```python\nimport string\n\ndef count_words(text):\n    # Create a translation table to remove punctuations\n    transtable = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\n    \n    # Split the text into words and convert them to lowercase\n    words = text.lower().split()\n    \n    # Remove punctuations from each word\n    words = [word.translate(transtable) for word in words]\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of each word\n    word_count = {}\n    for word in words:\n        if word in word_count:\n            word_count[word] += 1\n        else:\n            word_count[word] = 1\n    \n    return word_count\n```\n---\n\n<Write a function called 'add_numbers' that takes one argument, an integer, and returns the sum of all the digits in the integer.>\n\nTo write a function that returns the sum of all the digits in a given integer, you can use the `divmod()` function to extract the last digit of the integer, and then recursively call the function on the rest of the integer. You can stop the recursion when the integer is equal to zero.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement the `add_numbers` function:\n```python\ndef add_numbers(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        last_digit, rest = divmod(n, 10)\n        return last_digit + add_numbers(rest)\n```\n---\n\n<Write a function called 'is_prime' that takes one argument, an integer, and returns True if the integer is a prime number, and False otherwise.>\n\nTo write a function that checks if a given integer is a prime number, you can use a loop to check if the integer has any divisors less than or equal to its square root. If the integer has any divisors, it cannot be a prime number. If the integer has no divisors, it is a prime number.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement the `is_prime` function:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n---\n\n<Write a function called 'capitalize_words' that takes one argument, a string of words separated by spaces, and returns a new string where the first letter of each word is capitalized.>\n\nTo write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given string, you can use the `str.title()` method to capitalize the first letter of each word, and then use the `str.join()` method to join the words together with a single space.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement the `capitalize_words` function:\n```python\ndef capitalize_words(text):\n    # Capitalize the first letter of each word\n    words = text.title().split()\n    \n    # Join the words together with a single space\n    return ' '.join(words)\n```\n---\n\n<Write a function called 'reverse_string' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the string in reverse order.>\n\nTo write a function that returns the reverse of a given string, you can use slicing to get a reversed slice of the string, and then use the `str.join()` method to join the characters together.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement the `reverse_string` function:\n```python\ndef reverse_string(text):\n    return ''.join(reversed(text))\n```\n---\n\n<Write a function called 'is_palindrome' that takes one argument, a string, and returns True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards and backwards.>\n\nTo write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome, you can use slicing to get the first and last characters of the string, and then use the `==` operator to check if they are the same. If they are not the same, the string cannot be a palindrome. If they are the same, you can recursively call the function on the rest of the string, until you reach the middle of the string.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement the `is_palindrome` function:\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(text):\n    if len(text) < 2:\n        return True\n   ", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730318715, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1100, prompt_tokens=109, total_tokens=1209), provider='Together')
