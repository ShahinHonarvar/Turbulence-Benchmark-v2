It uses the `itertools` module for slicing the circular list and finding the sublists with the desired property.\n\nThe `cyclic_slice` function is a helper function that takes an index and a length as arguments and returns a slice of the circular list starting from the given index and having the given length.\n\nThe `sublist_product` function is another helper function that takes a sublist as an argument and returns the product of its elements.\n\nThe `list_with_product_equal_n` function uses a list comprehension to generate all possible sublists of the circular list, filter them based on the desired property, and return the resulting list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730364613, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=332, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=540), provider='Together')
