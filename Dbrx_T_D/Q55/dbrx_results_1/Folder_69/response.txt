If the product becomes equal to the target, it yields a 0 to signal that a sublist with product equal to the target has been found.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` calculates the product for each starting index using the `product_cycle` function and checks if the product is equal to the target or if it is still less than the target and there are more elements to consider. If the product is equal to the target, it adds the corresponding sublist to the result list. If the product is less than the target and there are more elements to consider, it adds all sublists of the corresponding size to the result list.\n\nIf no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730364733, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=389, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=597), provider='Together')
