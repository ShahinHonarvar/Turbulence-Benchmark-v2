If it is, we multiply it to the cumulative product and add it to the current sublist. We continue this process until we find a sublist whose product equals the target. When we find such a sublist, we add it to the `result` list.\n\nAfter checking all sublists, we filter out any sublists that are longer than the original list, since they cannot be sublists of the original list.\n\nFinally, we return the `result` list.\n\nNote that this implementation uses a circular list by treating the first and last elements of the list as adjacent. This is done by simply allowing the index `j` to wrap around to the beginning of the list when it reaches the end.\n\nI hope this helps!
