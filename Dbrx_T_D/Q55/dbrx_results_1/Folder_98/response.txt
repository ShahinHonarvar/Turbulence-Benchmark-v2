The function uses a sliding window approach to check the product of contiguous integers. If the product equals -1, the sublist is added to the result list. If the product is less than -1, the window is expanded by adding more integers from the list. If the product is greater than -1, the window is moved to the right by removing the leftmost integer and adding the next integer from the list. The `circular_list` is treated as a circular list by allowing the window to wrap around from the end of the list to the beginning. The function handles duplicate sublists and returns all of them in the result list. The order of sublists in the result list does not matter.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730364838, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=361, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=569), provider='Together')
