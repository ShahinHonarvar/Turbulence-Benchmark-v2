The function uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible sublists of the circular list, and then filters the sublists to include only those whose product equals 100. The function also checks that each sublist is a contiguous subset of the circular list. If no such sublists exist, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such sublists, they will all be included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730364710, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=255, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=463), provider='Together')
