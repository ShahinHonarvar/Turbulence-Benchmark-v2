The function uses a helper function `sublists_with_product_equal_n` to find sublists with the desired product, and another helper function `circular_list_slice` to extract slices from the circular list.\n\nThe function `sublists_with_product_equal_n` uses a sliding window approach to find contiguous sublists with the desired product. It keeps track of the current product of the elements in the window, and if the product is greater than the target, it removes elements from the start of the window until the product is less than or equal to the target. If the product is equal to the target, it adds the current sublist to the result. The function `circular_list_slice` extracts a slice from the circular list using the start and end indices of the sublist.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` uses the `cycle` function from the `itertools` module to convert the input list into a circular list, and then calls `sublists_with_product_equal_n` with the circular list and the target number (-69). The result is a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -69. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730364563, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=483, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=691), provider='Together')
