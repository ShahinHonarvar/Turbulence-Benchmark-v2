The outer loop iterates over each element in `lst`, and the inner loop iterates over the sublist of `lst` starting from the current element of the outer loop. The function calculates the product of the elements in the current sublist and checks if it is equal to `n`. If it is, the current sublist is added to the result list. If the product is greater than `n`, the inner loop is broken. The function returns the result list at the end.\n\nNote that the function uses the `copy()` method to create a copy of the current sublist before adding it to the result list. This is because the `append()` method adds a reference to the sublist to the result list, and modifying the sublist later would also modify the reference in the result list. By creating a copy of the sublist, the function ensures that the result list contains independent sublists.\n\nAlso note that the function checks if the product is greater than `n` to avoid unnecessary calculations. If the product is already greater than `n`, there is no need to continue multiplying elements.\n\nI hope this helps!
