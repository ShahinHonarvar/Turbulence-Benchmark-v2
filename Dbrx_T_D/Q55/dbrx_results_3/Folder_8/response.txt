Iterate over the range of length of numbers\n2. Slice the circular list starting from i to i + len(numbers)\n3. If n is 1 or 0, then append sublist accordingly\n4. Check if the sublist contains any element other than 0 or non-float\n5. Calculate the product of the sublist\n6. If the product equals n then append the sublist to results\n7. If the product is less than n or greater than 0 then break the loop\n8. Return the results list\n\nThis way, the function will return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -41. If no such sublist exists, the function will return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730365193, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=349, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=557), provider='Together')
