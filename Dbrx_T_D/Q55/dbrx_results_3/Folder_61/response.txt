The function uses a sliding window approach to create sublists of different sizes. The product of the numbers in the sublist is calculated and compared to -10. If the product is -10, the sublist is added to the result list. If the product is smaller than -10, the sublist is abandoned and a new sublist is created starting from the next number in the list. If the product is greater than -10, the next number is added to the sublist and the product is updated. The circular property of the list is ensured by using the `cycle` function from the `itertools` module. The function returns a list of sublists that meet the criteria. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730365363, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=310, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=518), provider='Together')
