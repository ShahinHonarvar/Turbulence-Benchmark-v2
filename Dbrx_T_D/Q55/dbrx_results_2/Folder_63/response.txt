The function takes a circular list of integers as an argument. A circular list is a list where the head and the tail are adjacent to each other to form a circle.\n2. The function uses the `itertools` module to generate all possible sublists of the given circular list. This includes all permutations of the circular list, as well as all combinations of the circular list with a length between 2 and the length of the circular list.\n3. The function then filters the generated sublists based on the condition that their product equals 96.\n4. The function checks if there are duplicates of such a sublist and includes them all in the returned list.\n5. The function returns a list of sublists that meet the specified condition.\n\nNote:\n\n* The function uses list comprehension to generate the sublists and filter them based on the specified condition.\n* The function uses the `itertools` module to generate all possible sublists of the given circular list.\n* The function uses the `cycle` function from the `itertools` module to check if the product of the sublist's elements equals 96.\n* The function uses the `chain` function from the `itertools` module to chain the sublist and the element that makes the product equal to 96, and then chain all the sublists together.\n* The function uses the `lambda` keyword to define the function.\n* The function does not contain any comments.\n* The function is delimited only by triple backticks.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730365039, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=417, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=625), provider='Together')
