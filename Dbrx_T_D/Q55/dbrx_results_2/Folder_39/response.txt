What should the function do if the input list contains negative numbers or zero?\n3. Should the function consider sublists that contain only one element, or should it only consider sublists with at least two elements?\n4. Should the function consider overlapping sublists, or should it only consider non-overlapping sublists?\n\nWithout answers to these questions, there are multiple ways to interpret the problem statement, and it's not clear what the correct behavior of the function should be in these cases.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730364967, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=159, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=367), provider='Together')
