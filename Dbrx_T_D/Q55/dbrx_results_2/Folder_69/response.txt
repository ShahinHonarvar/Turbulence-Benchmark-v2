If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nThe function first defines a helper function `circular_sublists` which takes a list and returns a list of circular sublists of that list. It then defines a helper function `product` which takes a list and returns the product of all the elements in that list. The function then defines a helper function `find_sublists_with_product` which takes a list and a product `n` and returns a list of sublists of the input list which have a product equal to `n`.\n\nFinally, the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` uses a list comprehension to generate all possible sublists of the input list with a product equal to `n`, and returns a list of these sublists. The list comprehension uses the helper functions `circular_sublists` and `find_sublists_with_product` to generate the sublists with the desired product. The list comprehension uses two nested for loops to iterate over all possible sublists of the input list, and checks if the product of each sublist is equal to `n`. If the product is equal to `n`, the sublist is added to the result list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730365061, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=456, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=664), provider='Together')
