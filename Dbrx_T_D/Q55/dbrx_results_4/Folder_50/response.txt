The function first initializes an empty list `sublists` to store the sublists that meet the criteria. It then iterates over all possible sublists of the given list using `range` and `combinations` from the `itertools` module. For each sublist, it checks if the product of its elements is equal to the given number `n` (which is 45 by default) and if the sublist is a palindrome (since the list is circular). If both conditions are met, the sublist is added to the `sublists` list. Finally, the function returns the `sublists` list.\n\nNote that the function does not contain any comments and is delimited by triple backticks.
