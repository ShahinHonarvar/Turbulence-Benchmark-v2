The function handles cases where there are no such sublists or where there are duplicates of such a sublist. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter. The function uses a circular list, which is implemented using the `cycle` function from the `itertools` module. The function iterates through each element in the circular list and calculates the product of contiguous integers in the list. If the product equals 851, the sublist is added to the `sublists` list. The function continues to iterate through all possible sublists until it has examined all sublists in the circular list. The function returns the `sublists` list, which contains all sublists that meet the specified criteria.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730365562, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=309, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=517), provider='Together')
