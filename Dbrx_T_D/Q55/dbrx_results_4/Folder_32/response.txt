The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list of integers and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 76. \n\nThe function uses the `product` function from the `itertools` module to calculate the product of the contiguous integers in the sublist. The `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module is used to calculate the cumulative product of the sublist. The `combinations` function from the `itertools` module is used to generate all possible sublists of the given list. \n\nThe function checks if the first element and the last element of the calculated cumulative product is equal to 1. If both conditions are satisfied, the sublist is added to the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730365596, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=325, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=533), provider='Together')
