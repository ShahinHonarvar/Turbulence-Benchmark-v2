It uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible sublists of the given list, and checks if the product of the elements in each sublist is equal to 91. If it is, the sublist is added to the result list. The function handles the circular nature of the list by using the `cycle` function from the `itertools` module, which allows it to treat the list as if it were circular. The function also handles the case where there are duplicates of a sublist with the desired product, by adding all occurrences of such a sublist to the result list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730365811, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=306, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=514), provider='Together')
