It uses the `itertools.combinations` function to generate all possible sublists of the given circular list, where each sublist has a length between 1 and the length of the circular list. It then calculates the product of each sublist and checks if it equals 15. If it does, the sublist is added to the `sublists` list. Finally, the function returns the `sublists` list.\n\nNote that the `product` function is defined inside the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function, so it has access to the `sublist` variable. This is necessary because the `sublist` variable is not defined in the global scope.\n\nAlso note that the `sublists` list can contain duplicates if there are multiple sublists in the circular list that have a product of 15. If you want to remove duplicates, you can convert the `sublists` list to a set and then back to a list, like this:\n\n```python\nreturn list(set(sublists))\n```\n\nThis will remove any duplicate sublists from the `sublists` list. However, note that converting a list to a set and then back to a list will change the order of the elements in the list, so the returned list may not be in the same order as the original `sublists` list. If you want to remove duplicates while preserving the order of the elements, you can use the `dict.fromkeys` method, like this:\n\n```python\nreturn list(dict.fromkeys(sublists))\n```\n\nThis will remove any duplicate sublists from the `sublists` list while preserving the order of the elements.\n\nI hope this helps!
