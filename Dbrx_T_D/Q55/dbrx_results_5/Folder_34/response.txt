Product is a function that takes a list as input and returns the product of its elements. Reduce is a function that takes a binary function and a list as input and applies the function to the list's elements from left to right, reducing the list to a single value.\n\nThe circular list is first transformed into a list with the first element removed. Then, for each sublist in the list, the function checks if the product of the sublist's elements is equal to -81. If it is, the sublist is yielded as a result. The function returns an empty list if no such sublist exists.\n\nThe reduce function is defined in the sub-scope of the lists_with_product_equal_n function to avoid conflicts with the built-in reduce function in Python 3.\n\nThe order of sublists in the returned list does not matter, so the function does not sort the sublists.\n\nThe function handles duplicates of sublists by yielding all sublists that meet the criteria.\n\nThe function returns an empty list if no such sublist exists.\n\nThe function handles circularity of the list by rotating the list and checking the sublists in the rotated list.\n\nThe function handles the edge case where the circular list contains only one element and the product of that element is equal to -81. In this case, the function returns a list containing the single-element list.\n\nThe function handles the edge case where the circular list contains only one element and the product of that element is not equal to -81. In this case, the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe function handles the edge case where the circular list is empty. In this case, the function returns an empty list.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730365913, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=458, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=666), provider='Together')
