It then finds the first smallest number and initializes the second smallest number to positive infinity. It then iterates over the list and updates the second smallest number if it finds a number that is greater than the first smallest and less than the current second smallest. If the second smallest number is still positive infinity at the end of the iteration, it means that there is no second smallest number, and 'None' is returned.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe function `find_second_smallest_num` takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, and returns the second smallest element from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return 'None'.\nThe function first checks if the length of the input list is less than 2 and returns 'None' if it is. It then finds the first smallest number by using the `min` function. It also initializes the second smallest number to positive infinity. It then iterates over the list using a for loop and updates the second smallest number if it finds a number that is greater than the first smallest and less than the current second smallest. If the second smallest number is still positive infinity at the end of the iteration, it means that there is no second smallest number, and 'None' is returned.\n\n**Example:**\n```\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(find_second_smallest_num(numbers)) # Output: 2\n```\nIn this example, the function `find_second_smallest_num` is called with a list of distinct numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The function returns 2 as it is the second smallest element from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive.\n\n**Test case:**\n```\nnumbers = [1]\nprint(find_second_smallest_num(numbers)) # Output: None\n```\nIn this example, the function `find_second_smallest_num` is called with a list of distinct numbers [1].
