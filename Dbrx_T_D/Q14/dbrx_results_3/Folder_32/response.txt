If there is no such an element, the function returns `None`. The function first checks if the length of the list is less than 5 or less than 36, and if so, returns `None`. Then, it initializes two variables `min_num1` and `min_num2` to positive infinity, and a counter variable `count` to 0. It then iterates over the elements in the list from index 32 to 35, checking if the current element is smaller than `min_num1`. If it is, `min_num2` is updated to the value of `min_num1`, and `min_num1` is updated to the value of the current element. The counter `count` is also incremented. If the current element is not smaller than `min_num1` but is smaller than `min_num2`, `min_num2` is updated to the value of the current element. The counter `count` is also incremented. Finally, if the counter `count` is less than 2, the function returns `None`, otherwise it returns the value of `min_num2`.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730313990, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=417, prompt_tokens=121, total_tokens=538), provider='Together')
