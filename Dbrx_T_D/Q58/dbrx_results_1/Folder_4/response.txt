If no such submatrix is found, the function will return 0.\n\nThe function uses nested for loops to iterate through the matrix and create submatrices of size 5x5. It then checks if all the elements of the submatrix are equal to 15 using np.all() function. If the condition is satisfied, the count is incremented by 1.\n\nThe function returns the count at the end.\n\nIt is assumed that the input matrix is of integer type and is at least 5x5 in size. If the input matrix is not of the correct size or type, the function will not work as expected.\n\nAlso, the function does not check for the boundary conditions of the matrix, it is assumed that the matrix is at least 5x5 in size. If the matrix is smaller than that, the function will raise an IndexError.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730368621, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=292, prompt_tokens=126, total_tokens=418), provider='Together')
