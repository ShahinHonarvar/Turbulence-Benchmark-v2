It returns an integer representing the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 54 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns 0.\n\nThe function initializes a variable, `submatrix_count`, to keep track of the number of submatrices found. It then uses two nested for loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix, extracting a 2x2 submatrix at each iteration. The function checks if the sum of the elements in the submatrix is equal to 54, and if so, increments the `submatrix_count` variable. After the loops have completed, the function returns `submatrix_count`.\n\nNote that the function assumes that the input matrix is at least 2x2 in size, as it needs to be able to extract a 2x2 submatrix from it. If the input matrix is not at least 2x2 in size, the function will raise an `IndexError`.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730368616, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=321, prompt_tokens=126, total_tokens=447), provider='Together')
