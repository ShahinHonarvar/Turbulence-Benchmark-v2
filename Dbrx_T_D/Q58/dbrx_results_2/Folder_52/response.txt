If no such submatrix is found, the function should return 0.\n\nThe function `submatrix_with_n_numbers` is defined with a single argument `matrix` which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers.\n\nInside the function, a variable `submatrix_count` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the count of submatrices with 147 integers each.\n\nThe shape of the matrix is obtained and stored in the variables `n` and `m`. These variables represent the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.\n\nNext, two for loops are used to iterate through all possible submatrices of size 3x3 in the matrix. The range of the first loop is `n - 2 + 1` and the range of the second loop is `m - 2 + 1` because we want to iterate through all possible starting positions of the submatrices in the matrix.\n\nA submatrix is obtained by slicing the matrix using the i and j indices obtained from the for loops. The submatrix is then compared with the integer 147 using the numpy `==` operator, which returns a boolean matrix with `True` elements at positions where the corresponding submatrix element is 147 and `False` elements otherwise. This boolean matrix is then summed using the `sum` function, which returns the number of `True` elements in the matrix. If this sum is equal to 9 (i.e., all elements in the submatrix are 147), then we have found a submatrix with 147 integers each. In this case, the `submatrix_count` variable is incremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `submatrix_count` variable.\n\n**Note:** This solution assumes that the input matrix has at least 3 rows and 3 columns. If the input matrix can have fewer than 3 rows or columns, then additional checks will be needed to ensure that the submatrix slicing does not result in an `IndexError`.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730369022, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=558, prompt_tokens=126, total_tokens=684), provider='Together')
