It first extracts the elements at the specified indices. Then, it calculates the GCF of the three numbers by calling the helper function `gcd`, which calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The helper function `gcd` uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of two numbers. The GCD of the three numbers is then calculated by recursively calling the `gcd` function, passing the GCD of two numbers and the third number as arguments. The GCF of the three numbers is the final result returned by the function.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730354207, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=230, prompt_tokens=105, total_tokens=335), provider='Together')
