The function uses the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module in Python to calculate the greatest common factor of the three numbers. The `gcd` function is called twice, once to calculate the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 25 and 76, and once to calculate the greatest common factor of that result and the element at index 57. The result is then returned as the greatest common factor of all three numbers.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730354280, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=162, prompt_tokens=105, total_tokens=267), provider='Together')
