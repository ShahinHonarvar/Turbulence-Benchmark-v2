The function then extracts the elements of interest at indices 4, 0, and 8 from the input list `nums` and uses `reduce` to calculate the GCD of these elements. The GCD of three numbers is calculated as the GCD of the first two numbers, followed by the GCD of that result and the third number. The GCD of two numbers is calculated by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the two numbers are equal, and that number is the GCD.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730353530, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=217, prompt_tokens=105, total_tokens=322), provider='Together')
