The function uses a helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The `gcd` function is called recursively to calculate the greatest common divisor of the numbers at indices 7, 6, and 8, and the result is returned as the greatest common factor.\n\nI hope this helps!
