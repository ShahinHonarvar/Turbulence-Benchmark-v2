The GCF of three numbers is the largest number that divides all three numbers evenly. The function first calculates the GCF of the first two numbers using `math.gcd()`, then calculates the GCF of the result and the third number. This is more efficient than calculating the GCF of all three numbers at once, since the GCF of two numbers can be calculated in O(log min(a, b)) time using the Euclidean algorithm. The function does not contain any comments, and is delimited by triple backticks.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730353853, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=217, prompt_tokens=105, total_tokens=322), provider='Together')
