The function uses a helper function `gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor of the three numbers. The GCD of two numbers is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, and this process is repeated until the GCD of the third number and the previously calculated GCD is found. This final GCD is the GCF of the three numbers.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730353364, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=185, prompt_tokens=105, total_tokens=290), provider='Together')
