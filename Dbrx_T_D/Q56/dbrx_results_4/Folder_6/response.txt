The function uses the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible permutations of substrings of length 23, then checks if the length of each permutation is equal to the length of the set of its characters. If they are equal, it means that the permutation is a valid substring with no duplicate characters, and it is added to the result set. Finally, the function returns the result as a list.\n\nNote that the function checks for substrings that have no duplicate characters, not necessarily substrings that are composed of distinct characters. For example, the substring "aab" contains no duplicate characters, but it is not considered a valid substring by this function because it contains the character \'a\' repeated twice.\n\nAdditionally, the function only checks for substrings that are exactly 23 characters long. If the input string is shorter than 23 characters, the function will return an empty list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730366912, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=299, prompt_tokens=141, total_tokens=440), provider='Together')
