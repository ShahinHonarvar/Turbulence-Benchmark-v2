It uses `itertools.combinations` to generate all distinct substrings of length `i` where `i` is between `1` and `min(52, len(s))`. It checks if the number of unique characters in the substring is equal to the length of the substring, if true then it adds to the list of substrings. At the end, it returns the list of distinct substrings of length equal to `52` with no duplicate characters, if no such substrings exist in the given string, it returns an empty list.\n\n```\nYou are an expert in Python programming.

It uses a for loop to iterate over the minimum length of both strings. If the characters at the same index of both strings are equal, it appends the character to the `common_prefix` list. If the characters are not equal, it returns the joined `common_prefix` list or an empty string if the `common_prefix` list is empty. At the end, it returns the joined `common_prefix` list.\n\n```\nYou are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets.
