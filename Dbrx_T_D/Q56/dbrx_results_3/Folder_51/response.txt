If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function returns an empty list. The order of the substrings in the returned list does not matter.\n\nThe function first checks if the length of the input string is less than 96, and if so, it returns an empty list. Then, it creates a set called `substrings` to store the distinct substrings of length 96.\n\nThe function then iterates through the input string, starting from the first character and ending at the character at index `len(s) - 96 + 1`, as this is the last possible starting index for a substring of length 96. For each substring of length 96, it checks if the length of the substring is equal to the length of the set of unique characters in the substring. If they are equal, it means that the substring has no repeating characters, and it is added to the `substrings` set.\n\nFinally, the function returns the list of all distinct substrings of length 96, obtained by converting the `substrings` set to a list.\n\nNote: The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string, as it iterates through the input string and for each substring, it checks for the uniqueness of characters. The space complexity is O(n), as it stores all the distinct substrings in a set.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730366782, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=400, prompt_tokens=141, total_tokens=541), provider='Together')
