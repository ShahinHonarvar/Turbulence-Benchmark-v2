It uses the `itertools.permutations` function to generate all possible permutations of the characters in the string, and then checks if the length of the generated substring is equal to the length of the set of its characters, which would mean that there are no duplicate characters in the substring. If that is the case, the substring is added to the result set. The function finally returns the result set as a list.\n\nNote that the function uses a set to store the substrings during processing to avoid duplicates and improve performance. The order of the substrings in the returned list does not matter.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730366870, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=212, prompt_tokens=141, total_tokens=353), provider='Together')
