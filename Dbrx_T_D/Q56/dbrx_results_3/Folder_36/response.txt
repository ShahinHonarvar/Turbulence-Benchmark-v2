It returns a list of all distinct substrings of the length equal to 146, with no duplicate characters. The function first initializes an empty list, `result`, to store the substrings. It then iterates over the range of the length of the string, subtracting 146 and adding 1, to get the start and end indices for each substring. For each substring, it checks if its length is 146 and if the length of the set of its characters is also 146, indicating that there are no duplicate characters. If both conditions are met, the substring is added to the result list. Finally, the function returns the list of all distinct substrings with no duplicate characters, after converting it to a set to eliminate any duplicates, and then back to a list to meet the specification.\n\nNote: The function returns an empty list if no such substrings exist in the given string.\n\nAlso, the function does not check for the case where the input string is less than 146 characters long, as it is not mentioned in the specification. If this case needs to be handled, a check can be added before the for loop to return an empty list if the length of the string is less than 146.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730366747, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=345, prompt_tokens=141, total_tokens=486), provider='Together')
