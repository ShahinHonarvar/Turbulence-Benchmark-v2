It returns a list of all distinct substrings of the length equal to 106 with no duplicate characters. If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function will return an empty list. The order of the substrings in the returned list does not matter.\n\nThe function uses the `itertools.combinations` method to generate all possible combinations of positions in the string, with the length ranging from 1 to the minimum of 106 and the length of the string. For each combination, it checks if the characters at those positions are distinct using the `set` data structure. If they are, it appends the substring formed by those characters to the result list. Finally, it returns the list of all distinct substrings after removing any duplicates by converting the list to a set and then back to a list.\n\nPlease note that, as the specification requires the substring length to be 106, it may raise MemoryError or TimeOut error in most of the environments as it is a huge number.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730366451, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=311, prompt_tokens=141, total_tokens=452), provider='Together')
