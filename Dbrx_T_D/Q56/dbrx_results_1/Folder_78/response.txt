It uses the `itertools.combinations` function to generate all possible combinations of 49 characters in the string, then checks if the length of the substring is equal to the length of the set of the characters in the substring, which would mean that it has no duplicate characters. If it does, it adds the substring to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list with no duplicate substrings.\n\nIt's important to note that the function uses set to remove duplicates and the combinations function from itertools to generate all possible combinations of characters in the string.\n\nIt's also important to note that the function uses list comprehension to generate the combinations and set to remove duplicates, this make the function more readable and efficient.\n\nIt's also important to note that the function uses the `len(s)-48` in the range function to ensure that the substring is of length 49, this is to avoid an IndexError when the length of the string is less than 49.\n\nIt's also important to note that the function uses the `join` function to convert the tuple of characters into a string, this is necessary because the combinations function returns a tuple of characters.\n\nIt's also important to note that the function uses the `i+49` in the range function to start the substring at the right index, this is to avoid including the same character multiple times in the substring.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730366322, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=383, prompt_tokens=141, total_tokens=524), provider='Together')
