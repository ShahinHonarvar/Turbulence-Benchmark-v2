If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe function uses the `itertools` library to generate all combinations of 78 elements from the range of the string's length. For each combination, it creates a substring by joining the characters at the corresponding indices in the string. If the length of the set of characters in the substring is equal to 78, it means that the substring has no duplicate characters, and it is added to the result list.\n\nThe function uses a set to store the substrings, ensuring that there are no duplicates in the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.\n\nNote: Since the problem statement specifies that the Python code should not contain any comments, I have not included any comments in the code. However, I have added a brief explanation of the code in this response for clarity.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730366161, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=296, prompt_tokens=141, total_tokens=437), provider='Together')
