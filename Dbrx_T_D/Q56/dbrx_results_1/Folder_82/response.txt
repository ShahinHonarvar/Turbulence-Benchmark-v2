It initializes an empty list, `results`, to store the resulting substrings. The variable `n` is set to 100, indicating the desired length of the substrings. If `n` is greater than the length of the string, the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe function uses a set, `seen`, to keep track of the characters that have already been used in the substrings. It then iterates over the string `s`, slicing it into substrings of length `n`. For each substring, it checks if any of the characters have already been used by taking the intersection of the `seen` set and the set of characters in the substring. If the intersection is empty, it means that the substring contains no duplicate characters, and it is added to the `results` list. The characters in the substring are then added to the `seen` set.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `results` list, which contains all distinct substrings of length 100 with no duplicate characters. If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function returns an empty list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730366333, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=336, prompt_tokens=141, total_tokens=477), provider='Together')
