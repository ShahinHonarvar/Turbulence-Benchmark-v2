The function first checks if the length of the input string is less than the desired substring length, and if so, it returns an empty list. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate through the string, creating substrings of the desired length. It checks if the substring contains duplicate characters by checking if the length of the set of characters in the substring is equal to the length of the substring. If there are no duplicate characters, it adds the substring to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list, with any duplicate substrings removed.\n\nNote: This code is not optimized for large input strings, as it creates a set and a list for each substring. If the input string is very large, this could result in high memory usage. If memory usage is a concern, the code could be optimized to use a single set or list, at the cost of increased complexity.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730366338, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=275, prompt_tokens=141, total_tokens=416), provider='Together')
