In Python, list indices start at 0, so the element at index 1 is the second element in the list, and the element at index 4 is the fifth element. This means that the returned list will include the second, third, and fourth elements of the input list.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```python\nnumbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]\nresult = all_ints_exclusive(numbers)\nprint(result)  # Output: [8, 15]\n```\nIn this example, the `numbers` list contains the integers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42. The `all_ints_exclusive` function is called with the `numbers` list as the argument, and the function returns a new list that contains the elements at indices 1, 2, and 3, which are the integers 8, 15, and 16. The function does not include the element at index 0 or any elements at or beyond index 4.\n\nI hope this helps!
