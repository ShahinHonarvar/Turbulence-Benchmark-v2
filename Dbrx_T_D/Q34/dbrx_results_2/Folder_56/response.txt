However, it would be more common (and more pythonic) to pass a list of sets to a function that takes a single argument. Here is what that code would look like:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(set_list):\n    return set.union(*set_list)\n```\nThis second version can be called with a list of 63 (or any other number of) sets, like this:\n```python\noriginal_set = find_original_set(sets)\n```\nWhere `sets` is a list of sets.\n\nHowever, the specification specifically asked for a function with 63 distinct arguments, so I have provided that as well.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730338264, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=553, prompt_tokens=110, total_tokens=663), provider='Together')
