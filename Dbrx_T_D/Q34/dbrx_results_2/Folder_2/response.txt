In that case, a more efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n) can be implemented using a different approach.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730338044, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=203, prompt_tokens=110, total_tokens=313), provider='Together')
