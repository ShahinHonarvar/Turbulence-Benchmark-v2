The function returns the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it. This is achieved by first flattening the given sets into a single list, and then creating a new set that contains all the integers in the flattened list. This new set is guaranteed to be the smallest set that contains all the integers in the given sets, since it contains all the integers in the range between the minimum and maximum integers in the flattened list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730338509, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=500, prompt_tokens=110, total_tokens=610), provider='Together')
