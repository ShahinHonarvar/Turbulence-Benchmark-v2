Each argument is a set of integers, so we can use `set.union` to combine these sets into a single set. The `set.union` function takes in any number of sets and returns a new set that contains all the elements from the input sets. By wrapping the input sets in `*args` and then using `*args` as the argument to `set.union`, we can efficiently combine an arbitrary number of input sets into a single output set.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input sets are in fact distinct from one another. If the input sets may contain duplicate elements, we would need to modify the solution to remove these duplicates. However, the specification states that each input set is "an exact copy" of the original set, so we can assume that there are no duplicates in the input.\n\nAlso note that the output set is the smallest set that contains all the elements from the input sets. This is because the output set is obtained by taking the union of the input sets, which by definition contains all the elements from the input sets and no additional elements. Therefore, the output set is the smallest set that contains all the elements from the input sets.\n\nFinally, the specification states that the input sets are "delimited by angle brackets", but in Python, sets are delimited by curly braces `{}`. The use of angle brackets in the specification is likely a typo or a misunderstanding of Python syntax. The input sets should be passed to the function as Python sets, each delimited by curly braces. I hope this explanation is helpful!
