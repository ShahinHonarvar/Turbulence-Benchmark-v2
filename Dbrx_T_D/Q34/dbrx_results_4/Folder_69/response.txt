It uses the `union` method with the `set` constructor to create a new set containing all of the distinct elements from the input sets. The `locals()` function is used to get a dictionary of the local symbol table, and `values()` is used to get all of the values from this dictionary, which are the input sets. The `*` operator is used to unpack this list of sets, so that the `union` method is applied to all of them at once.
