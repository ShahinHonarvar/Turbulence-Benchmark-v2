It returns a new list that contains the same elements as `lst`, but with the value `581.49` inserted at index `86`. The resulting list will therefore have one more element than the original list.\n\nThe function uses slicing to create two new lists: one containing the elements of `lst` up to, but not including, index `86`, and another containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `86`. These two lists are then concatenated together, with the value `581.49` inserted between them.\n\nHere is an example of how the function can be used:\n```\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nnew_list = insert_at_index(my_list)\nprint(new_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 581.49]\n```\nNote that the original list, `my_list`, is not modified by the function. Instead, the function returns a new list that contains the desired modifications. This is in keeping with the functional programming style, which emphasizes the use of pure functions that do not have side effects.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730323504, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=284, prompt_tokens=120, total_tokens=404), provider='Together')
