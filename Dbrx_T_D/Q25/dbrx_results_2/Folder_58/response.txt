It does this by concatenating three lists together: the first part of the input list (up to but not including index 598), the value to be inserted, and the second part of the input list (from index 598 to the end). The result is a new list with one more element than the input list.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = insert_at_index(input_list, [385, 999], 598)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, [385, 999]]\n```\nNote that the input list is not modified by the function; instead, a new list is created and returned. This is a common pattern in functional programming, and it helps to avoid unintended side effects.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730323589, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=261, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=383), provider='Together')
