This is done using slicing to concatenate the first 28 elements of the input list, the value `[41, 69]`, and the remaining elements of the input list.\n\nHere are some examples of how this function can be used:\n```\n>>> insert_at_index([1, 2, 3])\n[1, 2, 3, 41, 69]\n>>> insert_at_index([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n[1, 2, 3, 41, 69, 4, 5]\n>>> insert_at_index([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n[1, 2, 3, 41, 69, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n>>> insert_at_index([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27])\n[1, 2, 3, 41, 69, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]\n```\nI hope this helps!
