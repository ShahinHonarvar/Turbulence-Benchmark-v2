Here's the Python code for the specified function:\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    return lst[:7] + [1, 7] + lst[7:]\n```\nThis function takes a list `lst` as input and returns a new list that is identical to `lst`, except that the value `[1, 7]` has been inserted at index 7. The function does this by using slicing to create two new lists: one that contains the elements of `lst` up to index 7 (`lst[:7]`), and another that contains the elements of `lst` starting from index 7 (`lst[7:]`). The function then concatenates these two lists with the value `[1, 7]` in between to create the new list that is returned.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730323926, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=167, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=289), provider='Together')
