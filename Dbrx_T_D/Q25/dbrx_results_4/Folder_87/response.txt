ChatCompletion(id='gen-1730323961-XZoIyxoYuChCTCDGkzBl', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Here is the Python code that meets the given specification:\n```\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    return lst[:69] + [92] + lst[69:]\n```\nThis function takes a list `lst` as an argument and returns a new list that is identical to the input list, but with the integer `92` inserted at index `69`. This is done by using slicing to create two separate lists, one containing all elements up to index `69` and the other containing all elements from index `69` onwards. These two lists are then concatenated together with the integer `92` in between to create the final output list.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nnew_list = insert_at_index(my_list)\nprint(new_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 92]\n```\nNote that the original list `my_list` is not modified by this function. Instead, a new list is created and returned.\n\nI hope this helps!
