Here's the Python code that implements the specified function:\n```\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s: str) -> str:\n    # Create a set to store characters between indices 56 and 88\n    chars_to_remove = set(s[56:88])\n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # If the character is in the set and occurs more than once\n        if s.count(char) > 1 and char in chars_to_remove:\n            # Remove all occurrences of the character\n            s = s.replace(char, '', s.count(char))\n    # Return the altered string\n    return s\n```\nFirst, the function creates a set called `chars_to_remove` to store the characters between indices 56 and 88. Then, the function iterates through each character in the string `s`. If the character is in the set `chars_to_remove` and occurs more than once in the string, the function removes all occurrences of the character using the `replace()` method. Finally, the function returns the altered string.\n\nNote that the function takes care to only remove characters that occur more than once between indices 56 and 88, as specified. The `set` data structure is used to efficiently check if a character is in the specified range, and the `replace()` method is used to remove the character while preserving the order of the remaining characters in the string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730340838, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=291, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=428), provider='Together')
