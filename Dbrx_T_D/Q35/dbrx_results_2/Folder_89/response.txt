It does this by first extracting the relevant portion of the string and then iterating over it in reverse order. If it encounters a character that has been seen before (using a set to keep track of previous characters), it removes it by creating a new string with the character's index sliced out. If the character has not been seen before, it adds it to the set of seen characters. This ensures that only the first occurrence of each repeat character is kept. Finally, the function returns the altered string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341016, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=284, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=421), provider='Together')
