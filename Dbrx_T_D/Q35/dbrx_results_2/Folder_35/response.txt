It iterates over the characters in the string, and for each character in the range of indices from 77 to 84, both exclusive, that has not been seen before, it appends it to the list and adds it to the set of seen characters. If the current character is not in the range of indices from 77 to 84, both exclusive, it appends it to the list. Finally, it returns the list of characters as a string.\n\nI hope this helps!
