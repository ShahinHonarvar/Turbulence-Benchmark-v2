It then iterates over each character in the string, checking if the character is in `char_set` or if it is within the indices 48 and 76 and in `char_set`. If the character meets either of these conditions, it is added to the `result` list. If the character is within the indices 48 and 76, it is added to the `char_set` set. Finally, the function returns the joined elements of the `result` list.\n\nNote that the indices 48 and 76 are exclusive, so the function will not modify characters at those indices.\n\nAlso, the function preserves the order of all characters in the string by using a list to store the characters, and then joining the elements of the list at the end.\n\n```", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730340855, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=280, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=417), provider='Together')
