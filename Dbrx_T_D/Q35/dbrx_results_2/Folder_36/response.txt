If a character appears more than once in this range, it is added to a set of characters to remove. If a character is already in the set, then all occurrences of that character are removed from the string (preserving the order of all characters). Finally, the altered string is returned. The function also checks if the input string is of the correct type and length, and raises a ValueError if it is not.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730340900, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=219, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=356), provider='Together')
