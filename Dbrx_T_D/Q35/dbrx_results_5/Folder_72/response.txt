It does this by iterating over the input string and checking if each character has already been seen before. If the character has been seen before within the specified range, it is skipped and not added to the result string. If the character has not been seen before, it is added to both the result string and a set of used characters. The function returns the result string, which contains only the characters that have not been repeated within the specified range.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341619, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=195, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=332), provider='Together')
