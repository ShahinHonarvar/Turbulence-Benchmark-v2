The function then converts the list to a string and returns it.\n\nIt is worth noting that, if the input string is long, this function will consume a lot of memory, as it creates a new list of the same length as the string. If memory is a concern, a better approach would be to iterate over the string twice, once to find the unique characters and once to build the final string. However, the current implementation is simpler and easier to understand.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341576, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=311, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=448), provider='Together')
