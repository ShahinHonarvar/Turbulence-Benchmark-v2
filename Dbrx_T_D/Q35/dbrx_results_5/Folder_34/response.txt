It iterates through the string from index 70 to 200, excluding the endpoints. If a character has already been seen, it is skipped. Otherwise, it is added to the set and the list of kept characters. Finally, the list of kept characters is joined back into a string, which is returned.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341541, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=204, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=341), provider='Together')
