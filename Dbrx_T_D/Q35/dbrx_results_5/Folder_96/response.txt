Here's the Python code that meets your specifications:\n```\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s: str) -> str:\n    chars_seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if i > 60 and i < 200 and c in chars_seen:\n            continue\n        if c not in chars_seen:\n            result.append(c)\n            chars_seen.add(c)\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\nThis function first initializes an empty set and an empty list to keep track of the characters that have been seen and the resulting string. It then loops through each character in the given string, with its index. If the index is within the specified range and the character has already been seen, it skips to the next character. If the character has not been seen, it appends it to the result list and adds it to the set of seen characters. Finally, it returns the resulting string by joining the characters in the result list.\n\nPlease note that the function removes only the repeating characters between the indices 60 and 200.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341667, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=246, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=383), provider='Together')
