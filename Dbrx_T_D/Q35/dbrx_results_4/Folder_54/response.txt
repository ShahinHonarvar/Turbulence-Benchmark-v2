It uses a set `seen` to keep track of characters that have been seen in the specified range, and a list `result` to build the new string. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the characters in the input string, checking if the current character has been seen before and is within the specified range. If the character has not been seen before, it is added to the set `seen` and appended to the list `result`. If the character has been seen before, it is not added to the set `seen` and not appended to the list `result`. Finally, the function returns the new string by joining the elements in the list `result` with an empty string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341369, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=255, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=392), provider='Together')
