The function takes a string as input and removes all occurrences of characters between the indices 11 and 76 (exclusive) that appear more than once in that range. The function preserves the order of characters in the string.\n\nHere's the function step-by-step:\n\n1. Initialize an empty set `seen` to store unique characters in the target range, and an empty list `result` to store the resulting characters.\n2. Iterate through the characters in the target range (from index 11 to 76, exclusive). If a character is already in the `seen` set, skip it. Otherwise, add it to the `seen` set and append it to the `result` list.\n3. Return the string representation of the `result` list, concatenated with the remaining part of the input string (from index 76 to the end).\n```\n```", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341395, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=274, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=411), provider='Together')
