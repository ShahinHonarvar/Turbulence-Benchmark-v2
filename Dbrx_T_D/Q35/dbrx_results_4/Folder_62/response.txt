It uses an `OrderedDict` to keep track of the characters in the string and their counts. The function iterates through the string and if a character is within the specified range and not already in the dictionary, it adds it to the dictionary with a count of 1. If a character is outside the specified range, it is always added to the dictionary with a count of 1. After iterating through the string, the function returns a new string that contains only the characters that were seen once within the specified range, while preserving the order of all characters in the string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341386, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=218, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=355), provider='Together')
