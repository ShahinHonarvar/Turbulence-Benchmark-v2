It first creates a set of all characters in the string between those indices. Then it iterates through the characters in the set and checks if the count of the character in the string between the indices 20 and 93 is greater than 1. If it is, it removes the first occurrence of the character in the string. The order of the characters in the string is preserved by using the `replace` method with a count argument of 1.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341053, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=183, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=320), provider='Together')
