It uses a set, `used`, to keep track of characters that have already been seen, and a list, `unique`, to store the characters that will be included in the final string. The function iterates through each character in the given string, and if the character is not in the `used` set and is between the indices 35 and 64, both exclusive, it is added to the `unique` list and the `used` set. If the character is not between these indices, it is simply added to the `unique` list. The function returns the `unique` list joined into a string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341154, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=243, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=380), provider='Together')
