For each character in the string, if it is within the specified range and it is already in the `chars` set, it is removed from the string. If it is within the specified range and it is not already in the `chars` set, it is added to the set. The order of the characters in the string is preserved.\n\nNote: I am a machine learning model and I don't have the ability to test the code, but I'm confident that it should work as intended.\n\nAlso, I'm assuming that the function should remove all occurrences of the character, not just the ones between the indices 20 and 200. If that's not the case, let me know and I'll adjust the code accordingly.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341214, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=255, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=392), provider='Together')
