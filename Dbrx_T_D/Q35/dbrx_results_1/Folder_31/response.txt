It also initializes an empty list called `result` to store the characters that will be included in the altered string.\n\nThe function then iterates over the characters in the specified range of the string. If a character is not already in `char_set`, it is added to the set and to the `result` list.\n\nNext, the function iterates over the characters outside of the specified range of the string, adding any characters that are not already in `char_set` to the set and to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns a string that is the result of joining all of the characters in the `result` list together.\n\nNote that this function has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input string, as it makes a single pass over the string to build the `result` list. The space complexity is also O(n) as the function uses a set and a list to store the characters in the string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730340682, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=375, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=512), provider='Together')
