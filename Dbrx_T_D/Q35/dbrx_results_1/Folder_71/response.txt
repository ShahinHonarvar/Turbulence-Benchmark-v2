Then, for each character in this set, it checks if the character occurs more than once in this substring. If it does, the function removes all occurrences of the character from the string while preserving the order of all characters in the string. Finally, the function returns the altered string.\n\nNote: The `replace` method is used to remove the characters, with the `start` argument set to the index of the first occurrence of the character in the substring to ensure that only the occurrences between the indices 20 and 35 are removed.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730340772, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=202, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=339), provider='Together')
