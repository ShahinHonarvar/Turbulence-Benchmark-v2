The `set` data structure is used to remove duplicates and speed up the search process. The `replace` method is used to remove all occurrences of the character, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The `index` method is used to find the first occurrence of the character in the specified range, so that only the repetitions are removed. The method is called with a starting index of 12, as the range is exclusive of the first 13 characters.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730340774, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=205, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=342), provider='Together')
