If it does, the function will not count subsets that contain duplicate elements more than once.\n\nAdditionally, the function assumes that the input set does not contain more than 60 elements, as the specification asks for subsets of size 60. If the input set contains more than 60 elements, the function will not be able to find any subsets of size 60.\n\nFinally, the function does not handle the case where the input set is not hashable, such as a list or a tuple containing a set.
