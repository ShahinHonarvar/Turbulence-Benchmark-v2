It uses recursion and the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the result. If the number of elements is less than 64, it returns 0. If it is equal to 64, it returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of subsets of size 64 by adding the number of subsets of size 63 and the number of subsets of size less than 63.\n\nThe number of subsets of size 63 is calculated by selecting one element from the set and then finding the number of subsets of size 63 in the remaining elements. This is done by subtracting the selected element from the set and calling the function recursively.\n\nThe number of subsets of size less than 63 is calculated by iterating over each element in the set and finding the number of subsets of size less than 63 in the remaining elements. This is done by subtracting the selected element from the set and calling the function recursively. The result is then multiplied by 2 to account for the number of ways to include or exclude the selected element in the subset. The number of subsets of size less than 63 is added to the number of subsets of size 63 to get the total number of subsets of size 64.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730343824, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=335, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=433), provider='Together')
