The function also assumes that the number 95 is a representative of a desired length, and it is not expected to be met exactly. The function counts all subsets that have a length that is less than or equal to 95, but it is highly likely that the number 95 was chosen to find subsets with length exactly equal to 95.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730344373, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=169, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=267), provider='Together')
