The function first checks if the length of the input set is less than 360, if so it returns an empty set. Then it initializes a set of subsets with a single subset containing the first 360 elements. It then loops through the remaining elements and for each element it generates new subsets by adding the element to each of the existing subsets. It then updates the subsets set with the new_subsets.\n\nIt's worth noting that the function returns a set of frozensets, because set is mutable and it can not be used as an element of a set. Also, the function does not check for duplicates, if the input set has duplicate elements, the function will return those duplicates as well.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n\\*2^n) and the space complexity is O(2^n) where n is the length of the input set.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any question or if there is anything else I can help you with.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730343678, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=313, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=411), provider='Together')
