This is due to the fact that the problem of finding all subsets of size 64 is computationally infeasible for most sets of elements. The function provided takes advantage of the fact that the number of subsets of size n in a set is the same as the number of elements in the set raised to the power of n. In this case, the power of 64 is used, which is the size of the desired subsets.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730344073, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=181, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=279), provider='Together')
