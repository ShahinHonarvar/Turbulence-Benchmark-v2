It first checks if the input is a set and if the size argument is 88. If not, it raises appropriate exceptions. It then calculates the binomial coefficient C(N, 88) using the factorials of N, K, and (N-K). The count of subsets is calculated by multiplying the binomial coefficient with 2^(N-K) and then dividing it by 2^88. The function handles potential overflows by returning `float("inf")` and uses an iterative approach to calculate factorials to avoid recursion depth limits.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730344091, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=545, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=643), provider='Together')
