The second function `count_subsets_of_length_n` takes the same arguments, and returns the number of such subsets.\n\nThe first function uses recursion to build all subsets of the input set with size `n`, by iterating over the input set and recursively building subsets of size `n - 1` from the input set without the current element, and then adding the current element to each of those subsets. The second function is similar, but it returns the count of such subsets instead of the subsets themselves. It uses the fact that the number of subsets of size `n` in a set of `k` elements is equal to the number of subsets of size `n - 1` in a set of `k - 1` elements, multiplied by `k`, which is calculated using the sum of the counts of subsets of size `n - 1` in the input set without each element.\n\nNote that the first function will return all subsets of size `n` without repetition, even if the input set contains duplicate elements. If the input set contains duplicate elements and subsets with repetitions are desired, the first function can be modified to use the `copy` method to create a new set without the current element, instead of using the subtraction operator.\n\nAlso, the first function returns a list of sets, and the second function returns an integer. If you want to use the second function to count the number of subsets of size `n` without building the subsets, you can modify the first function to return a set instead of a list of sets, and then use the `len` function to get the count.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the functions:\n```\n>>> input_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n>>> n = 2\n>>> print(find_subset_of_length_n(input_set, n))\n[{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}]\n>>> print(count_subsets_of_length_n(input_set, n))\n6\n```\nThe first function returns a list of sets, and the second function returns an integer.\n\nI hope this helps!
