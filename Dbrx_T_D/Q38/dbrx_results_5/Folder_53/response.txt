If any of these conditions are true, it returns 0 or 1 accordingly.\n\nIf the set has more than 73 elements, it recursively calls itself with the first element removed and with the set of the remaining elements (excluding the first element). This is done to ensure that each subset of size 73 contains the first element at most once.\n\nThe function then adds the result of the recursive call with the first element removed to the result of the recursive call with the first element included. This is done to account for subsets that include the first element and subsets that do not include the first element.\n\nThe function continues this recursive process until it reaches one of the base cases (i.e., the set has fewer than 73 elements).\n\nNote: This function does not check if the input is a set, as the prompt specifies that the input will be a set. If the input may not be a set, the function should include a check to ensure that the input is a set, and should convert it to a set if it is not. Additionally, this function assumes that the elements of the set are hashable, as the prompt does not specify that the elements are not hashable. If the elements are not hashable, the function may raise a TypeError.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730344526, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=391, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=489), provider='Together')
