If the input set has fewer than 59 elements, the function will return 0. The solution uses recursion to generate all possible subsets of size 59 and counts them. The base case is when the set has exactly 59 elements, in which case there is only one subset of size 59 (the set itself). In the recursive case, the function pops an element from the set and generates all subsets of size 59 by either including or excluding the popped element. The time complexity of this solution is O(2^59), which is exponential.<||_unused_1_||>', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730344497, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=207, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=305), provider='Together')
