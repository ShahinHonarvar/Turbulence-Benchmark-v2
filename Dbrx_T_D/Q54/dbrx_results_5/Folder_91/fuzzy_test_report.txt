Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587]


The correct answer was:

[797, 739, 733, 719, 599, 593, 379, 373, 317, 313, 311, 293, 239, 233, 79, 73, 71, 59, 53, 37, 31, 29, 23, 7, 5, 3, 2]

But the LLM code returned:
[797, 793, 791, 779, 773, 739, 733, 719, 599, 593, 533, 379, 377, 373, 371, 317, 313, 311, 299, 293, 239, 233, 79, 77, 73, 71, 59, 53, 37, 31, 29, 23, 7, 5, 3, 2]
