Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[407, 404, 283, -209, 454, -26, 12, 448, 333, 476, 335, -73, 5, -275, -8, -193, 8, -217, -26, -31, -264, -58, -340, 56, 341, 202, -282, 121, -88, 53, -288, 91, 74, -105, 401, 531, -266, -549, 281, -240, 514, 450, -112, 252, -440, -431, 312, 513, 442, 357, 227, 184, -462, 130, -535, -198, 438, 241]


The correct answer was:

450

But the LLM code returned:
1127
