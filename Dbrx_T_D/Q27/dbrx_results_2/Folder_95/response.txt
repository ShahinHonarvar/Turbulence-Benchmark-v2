The function uses slicing to split the input list into three parts: the first 21 elements (up to and including index 20), the new element to be inserted (80), and the remaining elements of the input list (from index 21 onwards). These three parts are then concatenated together to form the new list, which is returned as the function's output.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730326579, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=139, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=261), provider='Together')
