It returns a new list that is identical to the input list, except it has the list [699, 556] inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 361. The returned list will have one more element than the given list. This is achieved by slicing the input list into two parts, the first part up to and including index 361, and the second part from index 362 onwards. The list [699, 556] is then inserted between these two parts.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730325884, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=146, prompt_tokens=126, total_tokens=272), provider='Together')
