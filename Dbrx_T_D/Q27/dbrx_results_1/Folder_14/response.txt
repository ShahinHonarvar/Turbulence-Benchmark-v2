Here's the Python code that implements the specified function:\n```\ndef insert_after_index(lst):\n    new_lst = lst[:16] + [550.97] + lst[16:]\n    return new_lst\n```\nThis function takes a list `lst` as its argument and returns a new list that contains the same elements as `lst`, but with the value `550.97` inserted at the index immediately after the 15th index. The function uses slicing to create two separate lists: one that contains the first 16 elements of `lst` (up to, but not including, the 16th element), and another that contains the remaining elements of `lst` (starting with the 16th element). These two lists are then concatenated together with the value `550.97` inserted in between, and the resulting list is returned.\n\nFor example, if `lst` is the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]`, then `insert_after_index(lst)` would return the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 550.97, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]`.\n\nI hope this helps!
