If it finds an element equal to 183, it uses slicing to create a new list that contains the elements up to and including the index of 183, followed by the elements [148, 145], and then the elements from the original list starting at the index immediately following 183. This new list is then returned. If the function does not find any elements equal to 183, it will simply return the original list.\n\nIt's important to note that if there are multiple occurrences of the number 183 in the list, the function will insert [148, 145] after each occurrence.\n\nAlso, this function will return a new list, leaving the original list unchanged. If you want to modify the original list in-place, you can use list.insert() method instead of slicing.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the function:\n\n>>> lst = [1, 2, 3, 183, 4, 5]\n>>> insert_after_index(lst)\n[1, 2, 3, 183, 48, 145, 4, 5]\n>>> \n\nIn this example, the original list is unchanged and the function returns a new list with [48, 145] inserted after index 183.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730324948, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=333, prompt_tokens=126, total_tokens=459), provider='Together')
