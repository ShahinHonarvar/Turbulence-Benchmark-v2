This is achieved by using list slicing to create a new list that contains the elements of `lst` up to and including index `295`, followed by the value `[276, 376]`, followed by the elements of `lst` starting from the element at index `295` (which is the element at index `296` in the original list).\n\nNote that if `295` is not a valid index in `lst`, then this function will raise an `IndexError` exception. If you want to avoid this, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to make sure that `295` is a valid index in `lst`.\n\nI hope this helps!
