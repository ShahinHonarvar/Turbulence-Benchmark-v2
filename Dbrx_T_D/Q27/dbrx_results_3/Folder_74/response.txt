This is achieved by slicing the input list into two parts, one before and one after the index 42 (which is the index immediately succeeding index 41), and then concatenating them together with the list `[74, 70]` in the middle. The returned list will have one more element than the input list.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730326751, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=150, prompt_tokens=126, total_tokens=276), provider='Together')
