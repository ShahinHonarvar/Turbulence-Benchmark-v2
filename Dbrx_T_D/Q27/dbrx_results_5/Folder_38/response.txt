If there is no such index or if the value at index 89 is greater than or equal to the value at index 90, then 86 is added to the end of the list. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function first initializes a variable `index` to 89, which is the index where the new value should be inserted.\n2. The function then uses a while loop to find the index immediately succeeding index 89 where the value is less than or equal to the value at index 89. This is necessary because the new value should be inserted after the last contiguous block of values that are greater than or equal to the value at index 89.\n3. The function then creates a new list that includes all the elements of the original list up to and including the index where the new value will be inserted, followed by the new value, followed by all the remaining elements of the original list.\n4. Finally, the function returns the new list.\n\nNote that if the original list does not contain the value 89, then the function will raise an `IndexError`. If you want to handle this case differently, you can add some error checking code at the beginning of the function.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730327017, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=354, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=476), provider='Together')
