In this problem, the 66th number in the Fibonacci sequence is calculated by iterating through the sequence until the desired length is reached. The binary string is then converted to a decimal number, and the function checks if this decimal number is divisible by the 66th Fibonacci number.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730356735, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=166, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=318), provider='Together')
