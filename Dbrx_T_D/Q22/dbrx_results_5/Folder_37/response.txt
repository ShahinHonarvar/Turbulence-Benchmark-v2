The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the numbers from `n` to `n * 18` with a step of `n`, and returns the sum of these numbers. For example, `find_sum_of_multiples(3)` will return `153` which is the sum of the first 17 positive multiples of 3.\n\nTo explain why we stop at `n * 18`, let's consider the following:\n\n* The 17th multiple of `n` is `17 * n`.\n* To get the sum of the first 17 multiples of `n`, we need to add `n` to the sum of the first 16 multiples of `n`.\n* The sum of the first 16 multiples of `n` is `16 * n` plus the sum of the first 15 multiples of `n`.\n* We can continue this process until we reach the sum of the first multiple of `n`, which is `n`.\n* Therefore, the sum of the first 17 multiples of `n` is `n + (16 * n) + (15 * n) + ... + (2 * n) + n`.\n* This sum can be simplified as `17 * n + 16n + 15n + ... + 2n + n`.\n* Since all terms are divisible by `n`, we can factor out `n` to get `n * (17 + 16 + 15 + ... + 2 + 1)`.\n* The sum of the first 17 positive integers is `18 * 17 / 2 = 153`.\n* Therefore, the sum of the first 17 multiples of `n` is `n * 153`.\n\nThis is why the function generates numbers from `n` to `n * 18` with a step of `n` and returns the sum of these numbers.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730321037, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=444, prompt_tokens=101, total_tokens=545), provider='Together')
