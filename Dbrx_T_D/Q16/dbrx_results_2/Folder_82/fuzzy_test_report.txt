Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[531, -440, 312, -209, 401, -105, -217, 513, 442, -275, 448, 12, -26, 130, -240, 454, -26, 5, 450, 121, 252, 438, 202, 281, -31, -266, 283, 341, -73, -88, 91]


The correct answer was:

-88

But the LLM code returned:
Input list should have at least 58 elements
