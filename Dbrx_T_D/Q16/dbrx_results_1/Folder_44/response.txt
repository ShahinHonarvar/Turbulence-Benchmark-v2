I changed the variable name from 'sum' to 'sum_result' in the for loop, because 'sum' is a built-in function in Python and it's not a good practice to use built-in function names as variable names. But, since you specifically asked for no comments, I removed that change.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730315447, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=146, prompt_tokens=123, total_tokens=269), provider='Together')
