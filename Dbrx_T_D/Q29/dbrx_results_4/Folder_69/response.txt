The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCF of the two numbers. The helper function `gcd` takes two arguments and calculates their greatest common divisor. The algorithm repeats the process of replacing `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0, in which case `a` is the GCD of the original two numbers. The main function, `gcf_two_nums`, extracts the two numbers from the input list and calculates their GCF using the helper function.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730330510, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=214, prompt_tokens=102, total_tokens=316), provider='Together')
