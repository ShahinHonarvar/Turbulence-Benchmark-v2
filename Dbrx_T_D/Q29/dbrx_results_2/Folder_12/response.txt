The solution uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers and the `functools.reduce` function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more integers. The LCM of two integers is calculated by dividing their product by their GCD. The GCD of more than two integers is calculated by recursively finding the GCD of the first two integers and the next integer. The GCD of two integers is a positive integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The LCM of two integers is a positive integer that is divisible by both of them. The GCD and LCM of two or more integers are related by the formula: `gcd(a1, a2, a3, ...) * lcm(a1, a2, a3, ...) = a1 * a2 * a3 * ...`.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730329178, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=276, prompt_tokens=102, total_tokens=378), provider='Together')
