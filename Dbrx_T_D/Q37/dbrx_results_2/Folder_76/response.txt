It uses the `enumerate` function to iterate through the string, keeping track of the index and the character at that index. If the index is outside the range of 379 to 898 or the character is not between 'M' and 'v' inclusive, the character is added to the new string using the `join` function. If the index is within the range and the character is between 'M' and 'v', it is not added to the new string.
