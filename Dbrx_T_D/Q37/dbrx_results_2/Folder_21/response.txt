The text you provided didn\'t include them in the first place. I\'ve added the function I created according to the text specification. The function `filter_chars` takes a string as an argument, and returns an altered version of that string. The function checks each character of the input string, and if the character is within the specified range (between indices 603 and 759, both inclusive) and its value is between \'Q\' and \'h\' (both inclusive), it doesn\'t include that character in the result.useRalative', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730342829, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=187, prompt_tokens=153, total_tokens=340), provider='Together')
