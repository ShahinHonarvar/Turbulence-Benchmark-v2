It first creates a set of characters to remove by finding the intersection of the range of characters between '-' and 'D' and the range of characters between the 770th and 969th indices of the input string. Then, it uses a generator expression to create a new string that only includes characters that are not in the set of characters to remove. The order of characters is preserved by using the `join` method with an empty string as the separator.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730343190, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=202, prompt_tokens=151, total_tokens=353), provider='Together')
