The set is created by taking a slice of the string from indices 26 to 64 (inclusive), converting it to a set to remove duplicates, and then intersecting it with a range of character codes from 'V' to 'o' (inclusive) using the `set.intersection()` method.\n\nThe function then iterates over each character in the set of characters to remove and removes all occurrences of that character from the string using the `str.replace()` method.\n\nFinally, the function returns the altered string.\n\nNote: The string slicing and character code range are based on the assumption that the string contains only printable ASCII characters.
