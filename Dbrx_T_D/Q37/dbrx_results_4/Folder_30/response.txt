It creates a list of characters from the input string. Then, it iterates over each character in the list, checking if the index of the character is between 41 and 64, both inclusive, and if the character is greater than or equal to 'K' and smaller than or equal to ']'. If the character meets these conditions, it is replaced with an empty string.
