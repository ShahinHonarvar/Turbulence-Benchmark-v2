If it is not, the character is added to the new string.\n\nFinally, it returns the new string, which is the original string with the desired characters removed.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730343116, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=214, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=366), provider='Together')
