It iterates through each character of the string, checking if its index is outside the range of 29 to 97, or if the character is not between \'-\' and \'n\' inclusive. If either of these conditions is met, the character is added to the `result` string. If neither condition is met, the character is not added to the `result` string, effectively removing it.
