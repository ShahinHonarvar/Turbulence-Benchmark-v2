It does this by first creating a set of characters within the range `'5'-'_'` using the `ord` function to get the ASCII values of the characters. It then creates a set of characters that are in the string's 2nd and 3rd indices and also in the filter range. Finally, it returns a new string that is the result of joining all the characters in the original string that are not in the set of characters to remove.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730343083, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=193, prompt_tokens=151, total_tokens=344), provider='Together')
