It then loops through each character in the string and its corresponding index. If the index is not between 722 and 832 (inclusive) or the character is not between 'K' and 'm' (inclusive), it appends the character to `filtered_chars`. Finally, it returns the filtered characters as a string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730343394, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=173, prompt_tokens=153, total_tokens=326), provider='Together')
