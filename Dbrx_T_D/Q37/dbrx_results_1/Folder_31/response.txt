The characters to be removed are those that have a code point between 57 and 96 (inclusive) and are also greater than or equal to '<' and smaller than or equal to 'w'. The set of code points of these characters is computed as the intersection of two sets: the first set contains all integers from 57 to 96 (inclusive), and the second set contains all code points between '<' and 'w' (inclusive). The result is a set of code points that need to be removed. The function then uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the input string and checks whether its code point is in the set of code points to be removed. If the code point is not in the set, the character is included in the result string. Finally, the function returns the result string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730342657, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=249, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=401), provider='Together')
