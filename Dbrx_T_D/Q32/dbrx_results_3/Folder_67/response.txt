If the requirement is to insert '1' only after immediately succeeding occurrences of 'j', then the solution would be more complex, involving a loop or regular expression.\n\nHere's an example of a more complex solution that inserts '1' only after immediately succeeding occurrences of 'j':\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef insert_after_character(input_string):\n    return re.sub(r'(j(?![1-9])[a-z])', r'\\11', input_string, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n```\nThis solution uses a regular expression to find all occurrences of 'j' that are not followed by a digit, and then replaces them with 'j1'. The regular expression uses a lookahead assertion to ensure that 'j' is not followed by a digit. The '\\1' in the replacement string is a backreference to the first capturing group in the regular expression, which is the character immediately following 'j'. The 'flags=re.IGNORECASE' argument makes the regular expression case-insensitive.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730335710, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=249, prompt_tokens=106, total_tokens=355), provider='Together')
