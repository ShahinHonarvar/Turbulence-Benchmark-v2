It does this using the `replace()` method of the string class, which replaces all occurrences of a specified phrase with another specified phrase.\n\nNote that the replacement phrase 'Ii' contains the original character 'I' followed by the new character 'i'. This ensures that the original character is not lost during the replacement process.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function behaves:\n```python\nassert insert_after_character('HI!') == 'HIi!'\nassert insert_after_character('Hi there') == 'Hi there'\nassert insert_after_character('I am an Iguana') == 'Ii am an Ii guanai'\n```\nIn the first example, the 'I' in 'HI' is replaced with 'Ii', resulting in 'HIi'. In the second example, there are no occurrences of 'I', so the input string is returned unchanged. In the third example, there are two occurrences of 'I', both of which are replaced with 'Ii'.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730336725, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=290, prompt_tokens=106, total_tokens=396), provider='Together')
