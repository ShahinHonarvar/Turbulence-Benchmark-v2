If the specification requires that 'I' should only be inserted if 'Q' is not already followed by 'I', then the solution would be:\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(input_string):\n    return input_string.replace('Q', 'QI', 1) if input_string.count('QI') != input_string.count('Q') else input_string\n```\nIn this solution, the `replace` method's third argument is set to 1, which means that only the first occurrence of 'Q' will be replaced. Then, the function checks if the number of occurrences of 'QI' is equal to the number of occurrences of 'Q'. If not, then it means that there is at least one 'Q' that is not followed by 'I', so the function replaces the first occurrence of 'Q' with 'QI'. If the number of occurrences of 'QI' is equal to the number of occurrences of 'Q', then the function returns the original string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730335322, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=263, prompt_tokens=106, total_tokens=369), provider='Together')
