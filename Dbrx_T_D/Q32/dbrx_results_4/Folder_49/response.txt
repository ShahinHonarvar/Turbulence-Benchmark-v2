It does this by using the `replace` method of the string, which replaces the first occurrence of the specified substring with the specified replacement. In this case, we replace the empty string following the character 'i' with 'i', effectively inserting 'i' after any occurrences of 'i'. The second argument to `replace` is set to 1, which means that only the first occurrence of the substring is replaced. This ensures that the function only inserts one 'i' after each original 'i'.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730336563, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=159, prompt_tokens=106, total_tokens=265), provider='Together')
