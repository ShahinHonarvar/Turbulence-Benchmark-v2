Each of the following lines contains a string that the function will be tested with. Each string is non-empty and its length does not exceed 100.\n\nPerformance:\nThe time complexity of the provided solution is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The algorithm checks each possible substring of length 7 in the input string, so the time complexity is quadratic. The algorithm stores the palindromic substrings in a set, which has a constant time complexity for checking membership, inserting and removing elements, so the space complexity is linear.\n\nThe provided solution is efficient and performs well on large inputs. However, if the input string is extremely long, the time complexity can be reduced by considering only the substrings with an odd length, which is a necessary condition for a palindrome, and by using two pointers to iterate through the string instead of checking all possible substrings. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n).\n\nTest cases:\n\n[Test case 1]\nInput:\n`"taco cat"`\nOutput:\n`set()`\n\n[Test case 2]\nInput:\n`"racecar a man a plan a canal panama"`\nOutput:\n`{\'racecar\', \'a man a\', \'man a m\', \'a plan a\', \'canal\', \'panama\'}`\n\n[Test case 3]\nInput:\n`"No \'x\' in Nixon"`\nOutput:\n`set()`', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730361651, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=403, prompt_tokens=162, total_tokens=565), provider='Together')
