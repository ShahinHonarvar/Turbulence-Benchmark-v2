The function first converts the input string to lowercase and defines the set of English letters. It then uses a regular expression to find all substrings of length `n` and checks if each of these substrings is a palindrome, meaning that it is equal to its reverse. The function also checks if all characters in the palindrome are English letters, to exclude any substrings that contain non-alphabetic characters. The resulting set of palindromes is returned as the output.\n\nNote: The function uses the `set` data structure to efficiently remove any duplicate palindromes that may be generated from overlapping substrings of the input string. Additionally, the function uses the `re` module to perform regular expression matching, allowing for efficient substring searching.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730361329, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=266, prompt_tokens=162, total_tokens=428), provider='Together')
