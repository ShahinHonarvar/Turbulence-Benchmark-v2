This is because for each substring of length n, we need to check if it is equal to its reverse, which takes O(n) time. However, since the required length of the palindrome is large (257), it is unlikely that this function will be called with a very long string as the input.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730361080, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=160, prompt_tokens=162, total_tokens=322), provider='Together')
