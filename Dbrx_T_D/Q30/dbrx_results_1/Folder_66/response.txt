This ensures that any 'k's that were already preceded by a 'k' are not affected. Then, the string is reversed (`[::-1]`), and the `replace` method is used again to replace only the first 'k' in each sequence of 'kk' with an empty string. This effectively removes the extra 'k's that were added in the first step. Finally, the string is reversed again to restore its original order. The number of replacements is limited to the difference between the number of 'k's in the original and modified strings to ensure that no extra 'k's are inserted.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730330858, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=197, prompt_tokens=106, total_tokens=303), provider='Together')
