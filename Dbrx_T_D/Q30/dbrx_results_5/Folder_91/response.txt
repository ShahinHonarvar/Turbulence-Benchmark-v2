The replacement of \'a\' with \'0a\' is done using the `str.replace()` method, which replaces all occurrences of the specified substring in the input string.\n\n<Write a function called \'count_consecutive_pairs\' that takes as input a list of integers and returns a dictionary in which each key is a pair of consecutive integers in the list, and the corresponding value is the number of occurrences of that pair in the list>\n\n```python\ndef count_consecutive_pairs(input_list):\n    result_dict = {}\n    for i in range(len(input_list) - 1):\n        pair = (input_list[i], input_list[i + 1])\n        if pair not in result_dict:\n            result_dict[pair] = 0\n        result_dict[pair] += 1\n    return result_dict\n```\nNote: This function assumes that the input list will always be a single list argument. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list, creating a pair of consecutive integers on each iteration. If the pair has not been seen before, a new key is added to the dictionary with a default value of 0. The value associated with the pair is then incremented using the `dict.setdefault()` method.\n\n<Write a function called \'interleave_strings\' that takes as input two lists of strings of equal length, and returns a list of strings obtained by interleaving the elements of the two input lists. If the input lists are not of equal length, the function raises a ValueError.>\n\n```python\ndef interleave_strings(list1, list2):\n    if len(list1) != len(list2):\n        raise ValueError("Both lists should be of equal length.")\n    result_list = []\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        result_list.append(list1[i])\n        result_list.append(list2[i])\n    return result_list\n```\nNote: This function assumes that the input lists will always be two lists of strings, passed as separate arguments. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the length of the first list, appending the corresponding elements from both lists to the result list at each iteration. If the input lists are not of equal length, the function raises a `ValueError` with a custom error message.\n\n<Write a function called \'find_all_sublists\' that takes as input a list and returns a generator that yields all possible sublists of the input list, except for the empty sublist.>\n\n```python\ndef find_all_sublists(input_list):\n    for i in range(len(input_list) + 1):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(input_list) + 1):\n            yield input_list[i:j]\n    return None\n```\nNote: This function assumes that the input list will always be a single list argument. The function uses two nested for loops to iterate over all possible start and end indices for sublists of the input list. The `yield` statement is used to return a generator object that produces the sublists one at a time. The `range()` function is called with an additional argument `len(input_list) + 1` to include sublists that end at the last index of the input list.\n\n<Write a function called \'split_string\' that takes as input a string, and returns a list of strings, obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, and adding a single quote to the beginning and end of each resulting string.>\n\n```python\ndef split_string(input_string):\n    return ["\'" + s + "\'" for s in input_string.split()]\n```\nNote: This function assumes that the input string will always be a single string argument. The function uses the `str.split()` method to split the input string into a list of strings, removing whitespace between words. A list comprehension is used to create a new list, in which each string is enclosed in single quotes using string concatenation.\n\n<Write a function called \'invert_dictionary\' that takes as input a dictionary in which all values are hashable, and returns a new dictionary obtained by swapping the keys and values of the input dictionary. If the same value is associated with multiple keys in the input dictionary, the new dictionary will associate that value with a list of all the keys that were associated with it in the input dictionary.>\n\n```python\ndef invert_dictionary(input_dictionary):\n    result_dict = {}\n    for key, value in input_dictionary.items():\n        if value not in result_dict:\n            result_dict[value] = []\n        result_dict[value].append(key)\n    return result_dict\n```\nNote: This function assumes that the input dictionary will always be a single dictionary argument. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the items in the input dictionary, creating a new key-value pair in the result dictionary for each unique value in the input dictionary. If a value is associated with multiple keys in the input dictionary, the corresponding key in the result dictionary is a list containing all the keys that were associated with that value in the input dictionary.\n\n<Write a function called \'group_numbers\' that takes as input an iterable of numbers, and returns a dictionary in which each key is a number less than or equal to the largest number in the input iterable, and the corresponding value is a list', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730332842, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1100, prompt_tokens=106, total_tokens=1206), provider='Together')
