The purpose of this function is to insert the character 'K' immediately before any occurrences of the character ' ' (space) in the input string. To accomplish this, we use the `replace` method of the string class, which takes two arguments: the substring to find and the substring to replace it with. In this case, we are finding the space character and replacing it with the string 'K ' (the character 'K' followed by a space). The result is a new string with 'K' inserted before any spaces, which we then return.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input string will not contain any occurrences of the character 'K' preceding a space. If this assumption is not valid, then a more complex solution would be required.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730332724, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=199, prompt_tokens=105, total_tokens=304), provider='Together')
