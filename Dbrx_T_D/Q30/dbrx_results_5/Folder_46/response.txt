The new string is identical to the input string, except that the character 'W' has been inserted immediately before any occurrences of the character '6'. This is achieved using the `replace` method of the string class, which replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string.\n\nNote: I had assumed that the character '6' is already present in the input string. However, if there is a possibility that the input string does not contain the character '6', you can use the following code instead:\n```\ndef insert_before_character(input_string):\n    return ''.join(('W' if c == '6' else c) for c in input_string)\n```\nThis code uses a generator expression to iterate through the characters of the input string and insert 'W' before '6' as necessary. It will work correctly even if the input string does not contain '6'.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730332766, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=229, prompt_tokens=106, total_tokens=335), provider='Together')
