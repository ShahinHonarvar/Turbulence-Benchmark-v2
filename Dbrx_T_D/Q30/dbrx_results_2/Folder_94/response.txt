It does this by using the `replace` method of the input string, replacing each occurrence of the space character ' ' with '5 '. This has the effect of inserting the character '5' before the space character. The resulting string is then returned.\n\n    Note that this function does not modify the original string, but instead creates and returns a new string. This is because strings in Python are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed once they are created. Instead, the `replace` method creates a new string with the specified replacements and returns it.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730332106, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=168, prompt_tokens=105, total_tokens=273), provider='Together')
