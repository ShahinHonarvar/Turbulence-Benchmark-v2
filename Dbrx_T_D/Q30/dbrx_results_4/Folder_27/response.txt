Also, the function `insert_before_character` takes only one argument, which is a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'j\' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character \'N\'.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to clarify that the function `insert_before_character` performs the desired operation by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is \'N\', it adds \'jN\' to the result string; otherwise, it adds the current character to the result string. This process repeats for every character in the input string, and the function finally returns the resulting string.\n\n```', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730332515, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=196, prompt_tokens=106, total_tokens=302), provider='Together')
