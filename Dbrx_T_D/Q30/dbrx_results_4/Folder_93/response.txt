It returns a new string that is identical to the input string, except that the character \'4\' has been inserted immediately before any occurrences of the character \'Y\'. This is achieved by using a generator expression that checks each character in the input string. If the character is not \'Y\', it is returned as is. If the character is \'Y\', the string \'4Y\' is returned instead. The `join` method is then used to concatenate all the characters in the generator expression into a single string.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730332684, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=163, prompt_tokens=106, total_tokens=269), provider='Together')
