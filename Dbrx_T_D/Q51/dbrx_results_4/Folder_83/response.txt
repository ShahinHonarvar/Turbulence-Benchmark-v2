It then iterates over each word in the given list. If the length of the word is less than three, it skips to the next word. Otherwise, it sorts the word in a case-insensitive manner and checks if there are any adjacent characters that are the same. If there are, it increments the counter by one and breaks the inner loop. Finally, it returns whether the counter is less than or equal to 19.\n\nNote: The time complexity of this function is O(n \\* m \\* log(m)), where n is the number of words in the list and m is the average length of the words. The function can be optimized by using a hash table to store the sorted words and checking if each sorted word is already in the table before incrementing the counter. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n \\* m).", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730360061, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=298, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=452), provider='Together')
