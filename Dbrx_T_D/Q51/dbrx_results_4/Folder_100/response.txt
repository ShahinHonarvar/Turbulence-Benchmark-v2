The function returns `True` if there are at most 98 pairs of anagrams in the given list, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a dictionary called `anagrams` to store the sorted versions of the words as keys and the original words as values. If a word has a length of at least three and its sorted version is not already in the dictionary, then the sorted version is added as a key and the original word is added as a value in a list. If a word has a length of at least three and its sorted version is already in the dictionary, then the original word is added to the list of values. Finally, the function calculates the number of anagram pairs by summing the length of each list of values in the dictionary divided by 2. If the number of anagram pairs is at most 98, then the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function considers only the anagrams of the English letters and compares the strings in a case-insensitive manner.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730360112, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=358, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=512), provider='Together')
