It does this by converting both strings to lowercase, removing any non-alphabetic characters, sorting the characters, and comparing the sorted strings.\n\nThe function `count_anagrams` takes a list of strings and returns the number of pairs of anagrams in the list. It does this by using the `is_anagram` function to check every pair of strings in the list.\n\nThe function `if_contains_anagrams` takes a list of strings and returns `True` if there are at most 44 pairs of anagrams in the list and `False` otherwise. It does this by calling the `count_anagrams` function and checking if the result is less than or equal to 44.\n\nThe `collections.combinations` function is used to generate all possible pairs of strings in the list. The `filter` function is used to remove any non-alphabetic characters from the strings. The `str.isalpha` function is used to check if a character is an alphabetic character.\n\nThe `sorted` function is used to sort the characters in a string. The `join` function is used to concatenate the characters in a list into a single string. The `lower` function is used to convert a string to lowercase.\n\nThe `len` function is used to get the length of a string. The `sum` function is used to add up the number of anagrams in the list.\n\nThe `<foo, bar>` notation is used to create a pair of values. The `for` loop is used to iterate over the pairs of strings in the list.\n\nThe `in` keyword is used to check if a character is in a string. The `<` operator is used to compare two integers.\n\nThe `return` statement is used to return a value from a function. The `True` and `False` keywords are used to represent boolean values.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730359675, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=510, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=664), provider='Together')
