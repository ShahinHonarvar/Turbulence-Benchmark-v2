In this case, we have a list of strings and we want to check if there are at least 98 pairs of anagrams in the list. The function `if_contains_anagrams` does exactly that.\n\nThe function first defines a set of symbols that contains all the uppercase and lowercase English letters. Then, it defines an inner function `is_anagram` that checks if a given string is an anagram. It does this by checking if all the characters in the string are in the set of symbols, if the length of the string is at least three, and if the sum of the counts of the characters in the string is at least three. This last condition ensures that the string contains at least one repeated character, which is necessary for it to be an anagram.\n\nThe function then uses a nested list comprehension to generate all possible pairs of strings in the list, and checks if each pair is an anagram of each other using the `is_anagram` function. It uses the `<` operator to ensure that each pair is counted only once. Finally, it checks if the total number of anagram pairs is at least 98 and returns the result.\n\nNote that the function is case-insensitive, as the `lower()` method is used to convert all the strings to lowercase before checking if they are anagrams. Also, the function only considers strings of length at least three as anagrams, as specified in the prompt.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730358755, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=434, prompt_tokens=141, total_tokens=575), provider='Together')
