It uses a while loop to iterate over the divisors of each number, starting from 2, and checks if the number is divisible by the current divisor. If it is, the function adds the divisor to the set of prime factors and continues checking with the next divisor. If the number is not divisible by the current divisor, the number is updated to be the quotient of the number and the divisor, and the function moves on to the next divisor. The loop continues until the square of the current divisor is greater than the number. If the number is greater than 1 after the loop, it is added to the set of prime factors. The function returns the set of all prime factors found in the numbers list up to index 132.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730349019, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=272, prompt_tokens=99, total_tokens=371), provider='Together')
