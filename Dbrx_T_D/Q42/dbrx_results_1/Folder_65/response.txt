It uses a set to store the prime factors to avoid duplicates. The function iterates through the list starting from the 36th integer (index 35) and for each integer, it checks for factors from 2 to the square root of the integer. If a factor is found, it is added to the set of prime factors and the integer is divided by the factor. This process continues until the integer is no longer divisible by the factor. If the integer is greater than 1 after checking all factors, it is a prime number and is added to the set of prime factors. The function returns the set of prime factors.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730348346, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=257, prompt_tokens=99, total_tokens=356), provider='Together')
