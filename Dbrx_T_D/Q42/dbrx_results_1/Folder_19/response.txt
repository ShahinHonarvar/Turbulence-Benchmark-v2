The function uses a while loop to find the prime factors of the number, starting from the smallest prime number, 2. If the number is divisible by the current prime number, it adds the prime number to the set of factors and updates the number to be the quotient of the division. If the number is not divisible by the current prime number, it increments the prime number by 1. The loop continues until the square of the prime number is greater than the number. If the number is greater than 1 after the loop ends, it means that the number is a prime number, and the function adds it to the set of factors.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730348250, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=246, prompt_tokens=99, total_tokens=345), provider='Together')
