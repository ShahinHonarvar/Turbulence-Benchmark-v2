The function uses a while loop to iterate through possible factors, starting from 2, and checks if the number is divisible by the factor. If it is, the factor is added to the set of prime factors and the number is updated to be the quotient of the division. If the number is not divisible by the factor, the factor is incremented. The loop continues until the square of the factor is greater than the number. If the number is greater than 1 after the loop, it is added to the set of prime factors.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730348363, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=214, prompt_tokens=99, total_tokens=313), provider='Together')
