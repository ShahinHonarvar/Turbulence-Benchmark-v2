If the length of the input list is less than 715, the function returns an empty set. The function uses a while loop to iterate through the possible factors of the input number, starting from 2. If the input number is divisible by the current factor, the input number is divided by the factor and the factor is added to the set of prime factors. The loop continues until the square of the current factor is greater than the input number. If the input number is still greater than 1 after the loop, it is added to the set of prime factors. Finally, the set of prime factors is returned.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730348743, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=256, prompt_tokens=99, total_tokens=355), provider='Together')
