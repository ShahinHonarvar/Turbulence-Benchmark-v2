For example:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\nprint(prime_factors(numbers))  # Output: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}\n```\n\nNote that the function iterates over the list of numbers and finds the prime factors of each number by checking if it is divisible by any number between 2 and itself. If it is divisible, then that number is a prime factor, and the function adds it to the set of prime factors. If it is not divisible, then the function continues checking the next number until it finds a prime factor. The function then updates the number to be the quotient of the division and continues the process until the number is no longer divisible by any number between 2 and itself. This ensures that the function finds all prime factors of the number.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730349167, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=346, prompt_tokens=99, total_tokens=445), provider='Together')
