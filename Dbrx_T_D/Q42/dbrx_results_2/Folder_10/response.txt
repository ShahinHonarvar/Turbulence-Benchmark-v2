It does this by iterating over the numbers from 2 up to and including the target number, checking if the target number is divisible by the current number. If it is not divisible, the current number is incremented. If it is divisible, the target number is divided by the current number, the current number is added to the set of prime factors, and the loop continues with the new value of the target number. This process continues until the target number is 1, at which point all prime factors have been found.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730348436, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=199, prompt_tokens=99, total_tokens=298), provider='Together')
