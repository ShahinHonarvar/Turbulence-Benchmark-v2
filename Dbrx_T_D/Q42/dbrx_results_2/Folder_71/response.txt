The function uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of a given number. It first checks for divisibility by 2, then iteratively checks for divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, the function adds the divisor to the set of prime factors and continues with the quotient. If the number is not divisible by any of the divisors, it is a prime number and is added to the set of prime factors. The function returns the set of all prime factors found during the process.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730348568, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=272, prompt_tokens=99, total_tokens=371), provider='Together')
