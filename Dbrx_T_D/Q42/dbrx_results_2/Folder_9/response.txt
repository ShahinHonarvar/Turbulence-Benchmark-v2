The function calculates the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 24 and returns it.\n\nFirst, we initialize an empty set called `prime_factors` to store the prime factors. Then, we extract the integer at index 24 from the input list and store it in the variable `n`. We initialize a variable `i` to 2, which is the smallest prime number.\n\nNext, we enter a while loop that runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. In each iteration of the loop, we check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is not, we increment `i` by 1. If it is, we divide `n` by `i` and update the value of `n`. We also add `i` to the `prime_factors` set because it is a prime factor of `n`.\n\nFinally, we return the `prime_factors` set, which contains all the prime factors of the integer at index 24.\n\nNote that the code contains no comments.
