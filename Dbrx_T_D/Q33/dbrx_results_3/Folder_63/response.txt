It does this by iterating through the string from index 34 to 68 (69 is exclusive), checking if the character is greater than _ and smaller than or equal to o, and if it is a vowel. If all these conditions are met, the character is appended to the list `vowels`. Finally, the function returns the list `vowels`.
