It uses the `join()` method to create a new string by iterating over the characters in the original string. The characters between the indices 10 and 15 (exclusive) that are greater than 't' and smaller than 'v' are omitted, and the remaining characters are combined into a new string. The characters before the 10th index and after the 15th index are then concatenated to the new string, preserving their order.
