It uses the `enumeraate` function to iterate over each character in the string, along with its index. For each character, it checks if the index is less than 58 or greater than or equal to 82, or if the character is not between 'F' and 'O', or if the character is not in the range of characters between indices 58 and 82. If any of these conditions are met, the character is included in the new string. Otherwise, it is filtered out. The function returns the altered string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730342163, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=184, prompt_tokens=149, total_tokens=333), provider='Together')
