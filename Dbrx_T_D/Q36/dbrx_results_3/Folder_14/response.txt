It uses list comprehension to filter out the characters between indices 41 and 56 (exclusive) that do not meet the condition specified. The condition is that the character should be greater than 'Z' and smaller than 'c'. The filtered characters are then joined back together with the unchanged characters from the beginning and end of the string.
