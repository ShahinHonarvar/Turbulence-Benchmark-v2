This is done by using a generator expression inside the `join` function, which filters out any characters that do not meet the specified condition. The `s.index(c)` is used to check the index of the character `c` in the string `s`, and only keeps the character if it is outside the range of 1 to 6 (exclusive).", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730342207, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=174, prompt_tokens=147, total_tokens=321), provider='Together')
