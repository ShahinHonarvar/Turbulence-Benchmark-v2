If it is, the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function returns the altered string.\n\nNote: The ASCII values of '*' and '[' are 42 and 91, respectively. The ASCII values of characters between '*' and '[' are 43 to 90.\n\nNote: The time complexity of this function is O(n) where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(k) where k is the number of characters between '*' and '['.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730342359, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=228, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=374), provider='Together')
