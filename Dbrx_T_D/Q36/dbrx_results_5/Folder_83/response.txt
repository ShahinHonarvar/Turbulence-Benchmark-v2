It does this by first creating a set of characters to remove, then splitting the string into three parts: before the range, the range itself, and after the range. It then replaces all occurrences of the characters to remove in the range with an empty string, and finally joins the three parts back together and returns the resulting string.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730342557, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=187, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=335), provider='Together')
