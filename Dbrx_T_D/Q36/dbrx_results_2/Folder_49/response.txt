This is because Python indices are 0-based, so the 91st character is actually at index 90. Also, the characters \'D\' and \'H\' are not included in the range, as they are not greater than \'B\' and smaller than \'G\'.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341966, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=242, prompt_tokens=149, total_tokens=391), provider='Together')
