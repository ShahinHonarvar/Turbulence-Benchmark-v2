The function first takes a slice of the first 21 characters of the input string. Then, it uses a generator expression to filter out the characters between the indices 21 and 25 (exclusive) that are greater than '5' and smaller than '}'. The filtered characters are joined together and concatenated with the first 21 characters and the remaining characters after index 25. Finally, the `filter_chars` function returns the modified string, which does not contain any occurrences of the filtered characters while preserving the order of all characters.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730341918, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=197, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=345), provider='Together')
