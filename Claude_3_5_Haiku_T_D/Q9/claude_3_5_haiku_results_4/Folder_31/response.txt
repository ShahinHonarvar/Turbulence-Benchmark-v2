Message(id='msg_01AZRC9GQQHzbyWRoSRBvGQW', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_odd_ints_inclusive(integers):\n    return [num for num in integers[75:89] if num % 2 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Takes a list of integers as input\n2. Uses list slicing to select elements from index 75 to 88 (inclusive)\n3. Uses a list comprehension to filter only odd integers from the selected range\n4. Returns the list of odd integers\n5. If no odd integers exist in the range, it returns an empty list\n\nThe function will:\n- Return an empty list if the input list has fewer than 89 elements\n- Select integers from index 75 to 88 (the 89th element is not included due to Python's zero-based indexing)\n- Check each integer in the range and include only those that are odd (not divisible by 2)", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=124, output_tokens=217))
