Message(id='msg_017TUgqm8Sk6Bm8Yxximkz9b', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `sum_in_range` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    return sum(num for num in numbers if 6 <= num <= 8)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a generator expression `(num for num in numbers if 6 <= num <= 8)` to filter the list for numbers between 6 and 8 (inclusive).\n2. The `sum()` function adds up all the numbers that meet the condition.\n3. If no numbers are between 6 and 8, the sum will be 0, which matches the requirement.\n4. It works for lists of any length, including empty lists.\n\nThe function concisely handles the requirements using a one-line solution with a generator expression and the `sum()` function.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=123, output_tokens=196))
