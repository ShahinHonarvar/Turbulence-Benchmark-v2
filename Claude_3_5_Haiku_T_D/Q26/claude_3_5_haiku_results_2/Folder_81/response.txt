Message(id='msg_017fJXJV4176GpEUsbUe7rHM', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `sum_in_range` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    return sum(num for num in numbers if 3 <= num <= 5)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a generator expression `(num for num in numbers if 3 <= num <= 5)` to filter the input list, keeping only numbers between 3 and 5 (inclusive).\n2. The `sum()` function is applied to this filtered generator, which calculates the sum of the selected numbers.\n3. If no numbers are found in the range 3-5, the function will return 0 by default.\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- It takes a list of integers as an argument\n- It sums only the integers between 3 and 5 (inclusive)\n- It returns 0 if no such integers are found in the list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=123, output_tokens=217))
