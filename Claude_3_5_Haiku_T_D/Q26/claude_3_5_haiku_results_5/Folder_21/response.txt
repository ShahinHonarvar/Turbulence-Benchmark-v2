Message(id='msg_01L7tosbhu8KwWgAMMQQJLk5', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `sum_in_range` function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    return sum(num for num in numbers if 138 <= num <= 858)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a generator expression to filter the numbers that are between 138 and 858 (inclusive)\n2. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of those filtered numbers\n3. If no numbers are in the specified range, the sum will be 0\n4. The function takes a list of integers as its argument and returns the sum of integers within the specified range\n\nThe implementation is concise and directly addresses the requirements by:\n- Checking each number is within the range 138 to 858\n- Summing only the numbers that meet the condition\n- Returning 0 if no numbers are in the range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=123, output_tokens=201))
