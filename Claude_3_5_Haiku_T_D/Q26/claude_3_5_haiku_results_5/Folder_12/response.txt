It uses a generator expression to filter the numbers in the input list that are between -91 and -61 (inclusive).\n2. The `sum()` function is then applied to this filtered set of numbers.\n3. If no numbers in the given range are found, the sum will be 0.\n\nThe function meets the requirements by:\n- Taking a list of integers as an argument\n- Summing only the integers between -91 and -61\n- Returning 0 if no such integers are found in the list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=123, output_tokens=178))
