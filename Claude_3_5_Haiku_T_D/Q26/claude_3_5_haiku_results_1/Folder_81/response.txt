Message(id='msg_01KANBzwH1DQVUQGDCRrmo6b', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `sum_in_range` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    return sum(num for num in numbers if 3 <= num <= 5)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a generator expression `(num for num in numbers if 3 <= num <= 5)` to filter the input list\n2. The condition `3 <= num <= 5` checks if each number is between 3 and 5 (inclusive)\n3. The `sum()` function adds up all the numbers that meet the condition\n4. If no numbers are in the range, the function will return 0 by default\n\nThe function handles all cases:\n- If numbers between 3 and 5 exist, their sum is returned\n- If no numbers between 3 and 5 exist, 0 is returned\n- Works with lists of any length\n- Works with both positive and negative integers", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=123, output_tokens=226))
