Uses a generator expression to filter the input list `numbers`\n2. Selects only the numbers that are between -91 and -41 (inclusive)\n3. Uses the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of those numbers\n4. Returns 0 if no numbers in the range are found (which is handled automatically by `sum()`)\n\nThe function will:\n- Take a list of integers as input\n- Check each number to see if it's within the specified range of -91 to -41\n- Sum up the numbers that meet the criteria\n- Return the total sum, or 0 if no numbers are in the range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=123, output_tokens=206))
