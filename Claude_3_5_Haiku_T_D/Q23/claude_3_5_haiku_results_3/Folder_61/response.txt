Message(id='msg_01DMMp6q2pakX7uAjnd6UQW5', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(2, 4):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a positive integer `num` as its argument.\n2. It initializes an empty list called `divisors`.\n3. It iterates through the range 2 to 3 (inclusive) using a for loop.\n4. For each number in the range, it checks if `num` is divisible by that number using the modulo operator `%`.\n5. If `num` is divisible by the current number (i.e., the remainder is 0), that number is appended to the `divisors` list.\n6. Finally, it returns the `divisors` list, which will either contain the divisors between 2 and 3 or be an empty list if no such divisors exist.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=129, output_tokens=245))
