Message(id='msg_01DLYuptH7aMZJzDXh21VNaX', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(8, 10):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a positive integer `n` as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list called `divisors` to store the divisors in the range of 8 to 9.\n3. It uses a `for` loop to iterate through the range 8 to 9 (exclusive of 10).\n4. For each number in the range, it checks if `n` is divisible by that number using the modulo operator `%`.\n5. If `n` is divisible by the current number, that number is appended to the `divisors` list.\n6. Finally, it returns the list of divisors.\n\nIf no divisors are found in the range 8 to 9, an empty list will be returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=129, output_tokens=250))
