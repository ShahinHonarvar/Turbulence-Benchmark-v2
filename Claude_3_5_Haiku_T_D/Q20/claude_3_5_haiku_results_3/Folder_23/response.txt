The function takes a list of distinct numbers as input\n2. `sorted(numbers)` arranges the list in ascending order\n3. `[13]` selects the 14th element (index 13), which is the 14th smallest number\n4. This naturally falls between indices 14 and 96 as specified in the problem statement\n5. Returns the 13th smallest number from the sorted list\n\nThe function assumes the input list has sufficient elements to perform this operation. It efficiently uses Python's built-in sorting to find the desired number without complex manual processing.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=163))
