Message(id='msg_01C86Ls5zRfURf9VoPQ7aE4Z', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):\n    return sorted(numbers[44:49])[4]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a list of distinct numbers as input.\n2. It slices the input list from index 44 to index 48 (both inclusive) using `numbers[44:49]`.\n3. It sorts the sliced portion of the list using `sorted()`.\n4. It returns the 5th element (index 4) from the sorted slice, which represents the 5th smallest number in that range.\n\nThe function assumes that:\n- The input list has at least 49 elements\n- The input list contains distinct numbers\n- The 5th smallest number can be found by sorting the slice and accessing the element at index 4", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=199))
