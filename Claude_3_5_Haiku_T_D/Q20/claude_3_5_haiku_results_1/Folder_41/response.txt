Takes a list of distinct numbers as input\n2. Slices the list from index 4 to index 8 (both inclusive) using `numbers[4:9]`\n3. Sorts this slice in ascending order using `sorted()`\n4. Returns the 4th smallest number within that slice, which is the item at index 0 of the sorted slice (`[4-4]` resolves to `[0]`)\n\nThis implementation ensures that the 4th smallest number is selected from the specified range of indices, sorted in ascending order.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=180))
