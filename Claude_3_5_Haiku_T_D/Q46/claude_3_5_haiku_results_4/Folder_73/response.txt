It defines an inner function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. It defines another inner function `gcf_multiple(a, b, c)` that calculates the greatest common factor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 90, 84, and 47.\n\n4. It uses the indices to access the specific numbers from the input list and passes them to the `gcf_multiple` function.\n\n5. The function assumes that the input list has at least 91 elements (since it uses index 90) and that the numbers are positive integers.\n\nThe function will return the greatest common factor of the numbers at the specified indices.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=334))
