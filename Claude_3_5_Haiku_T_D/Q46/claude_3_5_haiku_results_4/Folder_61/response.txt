Defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. Defines an inner function `gcd_three` that calculates the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n3. Returns the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 1, 2, and 7 of the input list.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 8 elements (so that indices 1, 2, and 7 are valid).", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=267))
