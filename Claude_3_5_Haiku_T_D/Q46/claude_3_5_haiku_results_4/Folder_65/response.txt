Message(id='msg_0175C8Uc1GdAnLCFPM4Yb9eZ', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the function `gcf_three_nums`:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    def gcd_three(x, y, z):\n        return gcd(gcd(x, y), z)\n\n    return gcd_three(nums[18], nums[10], nums[76])\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. It defines another inner function `gcd_three` that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n4. It returns the GCD of the elements at indices 18, 10, and 76 using the `gcd_three` function.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 77 elements (since it accesses indices 18, 10, and 76).", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=285))
