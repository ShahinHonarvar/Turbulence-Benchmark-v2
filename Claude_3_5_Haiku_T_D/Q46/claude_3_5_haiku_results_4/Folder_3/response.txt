Define an inner helper function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Define another inner helper function `gcd_three_nums(a, b, c)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of `a` and `b`, and then finding the GCD of that result with `c`.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the GCD of the elements at indices 31, 69, and 40 by calling `gcd_three_nums` with those specific indices.\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently calculate the greatest common factor (GCD) of the specified elements.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=305))
