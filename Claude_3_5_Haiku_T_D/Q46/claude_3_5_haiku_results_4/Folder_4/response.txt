It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. It defines another helper function `gcd_three` that finds the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two, then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers as input.\n4. It retrieves the numbers at indices 24, 25, and 80 from the input list.\n5. It calls `gcd_three` with these three numbers to calculate their greatest common factor.\n6. It returns the result of the greatest common factor calculation.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=278))
