Defines an inner function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Defines another inner function `gcd_three_nums(x, y, z)` that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers, then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums(nums)` calls `gcd_three_nums` with the elements at indices 86, 89, and 49 from the input list.\n\n4. Returns the greatest common factor of those three numbers.\n\nThe function assumes the input list is long enough to have elements at these specific indices and that all elements are positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=301))
