The outer function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. It defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n3. It defines another inner function `gcd_three` that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n4. The function returns the GCD of the numbers at indices 22, 97, and 64 in the input list by calling `gcd_three` with those specific elements.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 98 elements (since it accesses indices 22, 64, and 97) and contains only positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=299))
