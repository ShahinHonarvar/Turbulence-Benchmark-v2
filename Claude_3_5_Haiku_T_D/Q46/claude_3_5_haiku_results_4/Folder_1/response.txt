Defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Defines another inner function `gcd_multiple` that finds the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n4. It calls `gcd_multiple` with the elements at indices 74, 51, and 27 of the input list.\n\n5. Returns the greatest common factor of those three numbers.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 75 elements (to access indices 74, 51, and 27) and that these elements are positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=314))
