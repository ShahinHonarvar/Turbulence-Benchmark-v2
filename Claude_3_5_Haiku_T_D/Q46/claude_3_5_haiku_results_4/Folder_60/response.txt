Defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. Defines an inner function `gcd_three` that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n3. Returns the GCD of the numbers at indices 96, 53, and 35 in the input list.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 97 elements (since it accesses indices 96, 53, and 35) and that the elements are positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=269))
