Message(id='msg_01SipKyh5Ww5HpyLjDpW86Rt', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `gcf_three_nums` function:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(numbers):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    def gcd_three(a, b, c):\n        return gcd(gcd(a, b), c)\n\n    return gcd_three(numbers[74], numbers[60], numbers[28])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. Define an inner function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Define another inner function `gcd_three(a, b, c)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of the result with the third number.\n\n3. In the main function `gcf_three_nums`, return the result of calling `gcd_three` with the elements at indices 74, 60, and 28 from the input list.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 75 elements (since it accesses indices 74, 60, and 28) and contains only positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=293))
