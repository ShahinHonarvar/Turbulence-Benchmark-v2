Message(id='msg_01DwbyhsixVyZouQXR1J1znA', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `gcf_three_nums` function:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    def gcd_three(x, y, z):\n        return gcd(gcd(x, y), z)\n\n    return gcd_three(nums[34], nums[38], nums[77])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. Define an inner function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Define an inner function `gcd_three(x, y, z)` that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. In the main function `gcf_three_nums`, return the GCD of the elements at indices 34, 38, and 77 of the input list.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 78 elements (since it accesses indices 34, 38, and 77) and that all accessed elements are positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=291))
