The `gcd` inner function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The `gcd_three` inner function calculates the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n4. It returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 87, 20, and 36 by calling `gcd_three` with those specific list elements.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 88 elements to access index 87, and handles the task of finding the greatest common factor as specified.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=279))
