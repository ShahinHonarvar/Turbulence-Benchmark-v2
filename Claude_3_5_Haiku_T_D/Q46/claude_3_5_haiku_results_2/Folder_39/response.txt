Define an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Define another inner function `gcd_three` that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the GCD of the numbers at indices 85, 36, and 54.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 86 elements (since it accesses index 85) and contains only positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=267))
