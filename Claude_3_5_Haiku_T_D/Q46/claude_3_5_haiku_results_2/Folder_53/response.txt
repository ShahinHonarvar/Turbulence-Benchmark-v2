Defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. The `gcf_three_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n3. It calculates the GCD of the numbers at indices 66, 56, and 92 by first finding the GCD of the numbers at indices 66 and 56, and then finding the GCD of that result with the number at index 92.\n\n4. Returns the final GCD of the three specified numbers.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 93 elements (since it accesses indices 66, 56, and 92) and handles the calculation efficiently using the Euclidean algorithm.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=260))
