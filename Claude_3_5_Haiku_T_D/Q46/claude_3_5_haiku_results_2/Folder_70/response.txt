It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. It defines another inner helper function `gcf_multiple` that calculates the greatest common factor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the GCD of the numbers at indices 990, 671, and 711 using the `gcf_multiple` helper function.\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently find the greatest common factor, and it handles the problem of finding the GCD of three specific elements in a list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=299))
