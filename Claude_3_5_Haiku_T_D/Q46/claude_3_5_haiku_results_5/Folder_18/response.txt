Defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Retrieves the elements at indices 637, 411, and 757 from the input list.\n\n3. Uses the inner `gcd` function to calculate the greatest common factor by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n4. Returns the final greatest common factor.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 758 elements and contains only positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=240))
