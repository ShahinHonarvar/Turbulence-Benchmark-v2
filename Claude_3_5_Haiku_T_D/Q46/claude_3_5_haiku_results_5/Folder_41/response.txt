Defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. Takes a list of positive integers as input.\n3. Calculates the GCD of the elements at indices 19, 94, and 78 using nested calls to the `gcd` function.\n4. Returns the greatest common factor of those three numbers.\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm which repeatedly replaces the larger number with the remainder of the division until the remainder is zero, at which point the last non-zero number is the GCD.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=218))
