Defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor between two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. Defines an inner function `find_gcf` that calculates the greatest common factor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two, then finding the GCD of that result with the third number\n3. Calls `find_gcf` with the elements at indices 412, 932, and 337 from the input list\n4. Returns the greatest common factor of those three numbers", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=246))
