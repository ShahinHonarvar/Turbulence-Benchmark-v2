Define an inner function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. Define an inner function `gcd_three(a, b, c)` that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` retrieves the elements at indices 90, 54, and 96 from the input list and passes them to `gcd_three`.\n4. The function returns the greatest common factor of those three numbers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=269))
