The function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. An inner helper function `gcd` is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n3. Another inner helper function `gcf_multiple` is defined to calculate the GCF of three numbers by first finding the GCF of two numbers, and then finding the GCF of that result with the third number.\n\n4. The function returns the GCF of the numbers at indices 44, 91, and 42 by calling `gcf_multiple` with these specific elements.\n\nThe function will efficiently calculate the greatest common factor of the elements at the specified indices in the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=315))
