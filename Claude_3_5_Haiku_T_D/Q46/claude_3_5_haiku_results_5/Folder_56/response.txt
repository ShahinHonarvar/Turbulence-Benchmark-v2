Defines an inner function `gcd()` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. Defines another inner function `gcd_three()` that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n3. Returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 59, 93, and 84 from the input list.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 85 elements (indices go from 0 to 84) and that those indices contain positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=260))
