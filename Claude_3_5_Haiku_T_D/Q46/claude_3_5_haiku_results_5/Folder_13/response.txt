The `gcd` inner function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. The `find_gcf` inner function takes three numbers and finds their greatest common factor by first finding the GCD of the first two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers and returns the GCD of the numbers at indices 991, 244, and 974 by calling the `find_gcf` function with those specific indices.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 975 elements and contains only positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=273))
