Define an inner function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Define another inner function `gcd_three(x, y, z)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The `gcf_three_nums` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 944, 814, and 865 by calling the `gcd_three` function with those specific elements.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 866 elements and that the indices are valid.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=293))
