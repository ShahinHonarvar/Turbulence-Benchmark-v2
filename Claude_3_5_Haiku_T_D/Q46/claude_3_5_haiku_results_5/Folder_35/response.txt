Define an inner function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Define another inner function `gcd_three(x, y, z)` that finds the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers as input.\n\n4. It returns the result of calling `gcd_three` with the elements at indices 742, 888, and 629 from the input list.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 629 elements and contains only positive integers. It efficiently calculates the greatest common factor of the specified elements.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=306))
