Message(id='msg_01MMPD1BvKiPPCHQSaaeVzAF', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `gcf_three_nums` function:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    def gcd_three(a, b, c):\n        return gcd(gcd(a, b), c)\n\n    return gcd_three(nums[78], nums[19], nums[13])\n```\n\nThis solution does the following:\n\n1. Define a nested `gcd` function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Define a nested `gcd_three` function that calculates the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. In the main `gcf_three_nums` function, return the result of calling `gcd_three` with the elements at indices 78, 19, and 13 from the input list.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 79 elements (since it needs to access index 78), and all elements are positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=281))
