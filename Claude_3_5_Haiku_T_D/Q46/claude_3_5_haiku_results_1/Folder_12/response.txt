It defines a nested helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. It defines another nested helper function `gcd_three` that calculates the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 91, 45, and 48.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=256))
