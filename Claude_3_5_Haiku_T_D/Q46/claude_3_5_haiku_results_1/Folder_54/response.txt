The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. It includes a nested `gcd` function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n3. It also includes a nested `gcd_three` function that calculates the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n4. The function returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 96, 57, and 85 by calling `gcd_three` with those specific elements from the input list.\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently find the greatest common divisor, and it handles the three-number case by applying the algorithm successively.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=298))
