Message(id='msg_01Y8a1buUoggEJiom6TEsGQc', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `gcf_three_nums` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(numbers):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    def gcd_three(x, y, z):\n        return gcd(gcd(x, y), z)\n    \n    return gcd_three(numbers[307], numbers[920], numbers[463])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n1. It defines an inner `gcd` function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. It defines an inner `gcd_three` function that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers as input.\n4. It retrieves the elements at indices 307, 920, and 463 from the input list.\n5. It calls `gcd_three` with these three numbers to find their greatest common factor.\n6. It returns the result.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=283))
