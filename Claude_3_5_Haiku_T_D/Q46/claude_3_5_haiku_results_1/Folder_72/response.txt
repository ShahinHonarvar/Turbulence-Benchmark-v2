Defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Defines another inner helper function `gcf_multiple` that calculates the greatest common factor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. Calls `gcf_multiple` with the elements at indices 44, 91, and 42 from the input list.\n\n4. Returns the greatest common factor of those three numbers.\n\nThe function assumes that:\n- The input list `nums` has at least 92 elements (since it accesses indices 42, 44, and 91)\n- All elements are positive integers", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=307))
