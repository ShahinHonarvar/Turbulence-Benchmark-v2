Defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Defines an inner function `gcf` that calculates the greatest common factor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the GCD of the numbers at indices 46, 84, and 23 using the `gcf` function.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 85 elements (since it uses index 84), and that these elements are positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=268))
