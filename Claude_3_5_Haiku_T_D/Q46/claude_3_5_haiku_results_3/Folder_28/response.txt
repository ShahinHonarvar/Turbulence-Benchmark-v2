Defines a helper function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Defines a helper function `gcd_three(x, y, z)` that calculates the greatest common factor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums(nums)` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 99, 63, and 74 by calling `gcd_three()` with those specific indices.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 100 elements to safely access indices 99, 63, and 74.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=295))
