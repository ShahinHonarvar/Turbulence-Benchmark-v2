It defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. It defines another inner function `gcd_three` that calculates the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 944, 814, and 865 using the `gcd_three` function.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 866 elements and that the indices 944, 814, and 865 are valid indices within the list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=291))
