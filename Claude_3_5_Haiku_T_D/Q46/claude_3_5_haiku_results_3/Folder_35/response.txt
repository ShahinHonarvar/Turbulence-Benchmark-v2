The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. An inner helper function `gcd` is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n3. Another inner helper function `gcd_multiple` is defined to calculate the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of the first two, and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n4. The function returns the GCD of the numbers at indices 742, 888, and 629 by calling `gcd_multiple` with those specific elements from the input list.\n\nThe function will work for lists with at least 629, 742, and 888 elements, and will return the greatest common factor of the numbers at those specific indices.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=294))
