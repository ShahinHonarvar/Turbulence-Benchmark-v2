Defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. Defines another inner helper function `gcd_three` that calculates the greatest common divisor of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers, then finding the GCD of that result with the third number\n3. Returns the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 27, 85, and 51 in the input list\n\nThe function assumes that the input list contains at least 86 elements (to access indices 27, 85, and 51) and that all elements are positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=258))
