Defines an inner function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. Defines another inner function `gcd_three(x, y, z)` that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers, then finding the GCD of that result with the third number.\n\n3. The main function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the GCD of the elements at indices 20, 51, and 62 by calling `gcd_three` with those elements.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 63 elements (since it accesses indices 20, 51, and 62) and that these elements are positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=305))
