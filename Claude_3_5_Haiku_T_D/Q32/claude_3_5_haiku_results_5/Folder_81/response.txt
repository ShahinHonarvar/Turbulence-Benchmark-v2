Message(id='msg_015cq5uYsGbGaU4Zg3nj8ArA', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `insert_after_character` function:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(s):\n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        result.append(char)\n        if char == 'A':\n            result.append('A')\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It creates an empty list called `result` to store the modified characters.\n2. It iterates through each character in the input string.\n3. For each character, it appends the character to the `result` list.\n4. If the current character is 'A', it appends another 'A' immediately after it.\n5. Finally, it joins the characters in the `result` list and returns the modified string.\n\nFor example:\n- `insert_after_character('ABCAA')` would return `'AABCAAA'`\n- `insert_after_character('hello')` would return `'hello'`\n- `insert_after_character('AAA')` would return `'AAAA'`", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=256))
