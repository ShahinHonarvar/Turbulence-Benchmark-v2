Message(id='msg_01B1Fourd76x4CywsMqHjbnJ', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function as specified:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(s):\n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        result.append(char)\n        if char == 'i':\n            result.append('i')\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It creates an empty list called `result` to store the modified characters.\n2. It iterates through each character in the input string.\n3. It appends the current character to the `result` list.\n4. If the current character is 'i', it appends another 'i' immediately after.\n5. Finally, it joins the characters in the `result` list into a single string and returns it.\n\nFor example:\n- `insert_after_character('hiiii')` would return `'hiiiiii'`\n- `insert_after_character('hello')` would return `'hello'`\n- `insert_after_character('iiiiii')` would return `'iiiiiiii'`", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=245))
