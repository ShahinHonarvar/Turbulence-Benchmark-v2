Message(id='msg_01NWbdFRqbMU8aPLHNQX219u', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    result = ""\n    for char in string:\n        result += char\n        if char == \'o\':\n            result += \'o\'\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It initializes an empty string `result` to store the transformed string.\n2. It iterates through each character in the input string.\n3. Each character is first added to `result`.\n4. If the current character is \'o\', another \'o\' is added immediately after it.\n5. After processing all characters, the modified string is returned.\n\nFor example:\n- `insert_after_character("hello")` would return `"helloo"`\n- `insert_after_character("good")` would return `"goood"`\n- `insert_after_character("python")` would return `"pyothon"`', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=212))
