Message(id='msg_0154eFKpPiMUR6P4XymDufo1', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(s):\n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        result.append(char)\n        if char == 'U':\n            result.append('F')\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It creates an empty list called `result` to store the characters of the modified string.\n2. It iterates through each character in the input string.\n3. For each character, it first appends the original character to the `result` list.\n4. If the character is 'U', it then also appends 'F' immediately after it.\n5. Finally, it joins the characters in the `result` list into a single string and returns it.\n\nFor example:\n- `insert_after_character('HELLO')` would return 'HELLO'\n- `insert_after_character('UNIVERSITY')` would return 'UNIFFVERSITFY'\n- `insert_after_character('U')` would return 'UF'", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=254))
