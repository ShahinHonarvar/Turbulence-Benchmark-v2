Message(id='msg_01WL8FqPqtgSrmkaLiF6tJrs', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    if len(s) < 21:\n        return []\n    \n    result = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - 20):\n        substring = s[i:i+21]\n        if len(set(substring)) == 21:\n            result.add(substring)\n    \n    return list(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the input string is shorter than 21 characters. If so, it immediately returns an empty list since no 21-character substrings can exist.\n\n2. It creates an empty set `result` to store distinct substrings.\n\n3. It iterates through the string, taking substrings of length 21 starting from each position.\n\n4. For each substring, it checks if the substring contains 21 unique characters by converting it to a set and checking its length.\n\n5. If a substring has 21 unique characters, it is added to the `result` set.\n\n6. Finally, the function converts the set to a list and returns it.\n\nThe use of a set ensures that only distinct substrings are included, and converting to a list at the end matches the requirement of returning a list.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it makes a single pass through the string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the potential substrings.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=145, output_tokens=351))
