Message(id='msg_01DpAqkcDov2JTG6RTX3FvLX', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `all_substring_of_size_n` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    distinct_substrings = set()\n    \n    for i in range(len(s) - 98):\n        substring = s[i:i+99]\n        \n        if len(set(substring)) == 99:\n            distinct_substrings.add(substring)\n    \n    return list(distinct_substrings)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a string `s` as input.\n\n2. It initializes an empty set `distinct_substrings` to store unique substrings.\n\n3. It iterates through the string using a sliding window of size 99.\n\n4. For each substring of length 99, it checks if all characters in the substring are unique by converting it to a set and checking if the length of the set is 99.\n\n5. If a substring has 99 unique characters, it is added to the `distinct_substrings` set.\n\n6. Finally, the function converts the set of distinct substrings to a list and returns it.\n\n7. If no substring with 99 unique characters is found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Only substrings of length exactly 99 are considered\n- Substrings with unique characters are collected\n- Duplicate substrings are eliminated by using a set\n- The returned value is a list of distinct substrings with 99 unique characters", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=145, output_tokens=358))
