Message(id='msg_01GS3m9tRC43WVWF7bwUNFYZ', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    if len(s) < 84:\n        return []\n    \n    distinct_substrings = set()\n    \n    for i in range(len(s) - 83):\n        substring = s[i:i+84]\n        if len(set(substring)) == 84:\n            distinct_substrings.add(substring)\n    \n    return list(distinct_substrings)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the input string's length is less than 84. If so, it returns an empty list since no 84-character substrings can exist.\n\n2. It creates an empty set `distinct_substrings` to store unique substrings.\n\n3. It iterates through the string, extracting 84-character substrings starting from each index.\n\n4. For each substring, it checks if the substring contains 84 unique characters by converting it to a set and checking its length.\n\n5. If a substring has 84 unique characters, it is added to the `distinct_substrings` set.\n\n6. Finally, the set is converted to a list and returned. If no valid substrings are found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Only substrings of exactly 84 characters are considered\n- Each substring has no duplicate characters\n- Duplicate substrings are eliminated by using a set\n- The order of returned substrings does not matter", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=145, output_tokens=360))
