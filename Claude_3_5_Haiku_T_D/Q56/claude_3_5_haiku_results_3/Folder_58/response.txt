Message(id='msg_01La9SZUi3QAf4Hpf8UsPk9f', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    if len(s) < 127:\n        return []\n    \n    result = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - 126):\n        substring = s[i:i+127]\n        if len(set(substring)) == 127:\n            result.add(substring)\n    \n    return list(result)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the input string's length is less than 127. If so, it returns an empty list since no valid substrings can exist.\n\n2. It creates an empty set called `result` to store unique substrings.\n\n3. It iterates through the string, creating substrings of length 127 starting from each position.\n\n4. For each substring, it checks if the substring contains exactly 127 unique characters by converting it to a set and checking its length.\n\n5. If a substring has 127 unique characters, it is added to the `result` set.\n\n6. Finally, the function converts the set to a list and returns it.\n\nThe use of a set ensures that duplicate substrings are automatically removed, and the conversion to a list at the end meets the requirement of returning a list.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it makes a single pass through the string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the unique substrings.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=145, output_tokens=350))
