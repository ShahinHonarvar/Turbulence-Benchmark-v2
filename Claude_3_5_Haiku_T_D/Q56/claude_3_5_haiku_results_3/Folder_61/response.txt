Message(id='msg_01Ui7pT5vVHb1LZzFqMCuvwS', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    if len(s) < 39:\n        return []\n    \n    result = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - 38):\n        substr = s[i:i+39]\n        if len(set(substr)) == 39:\n            result.add(substr)\n    \n    return list(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the input string's length is less than 39. If so, it returns an empty list since no 39-character substrings can exist.\n\n2. It creates an empty set called `result` to store unique substrings.\n\n3. It iterates through the string, generating all possible 39-character substrings.\n\n4. For each substring, it checks if the substring contains 39 unique characters by converting it to a set and checking its length.\n\n5. If a substring has 39 unique characters, it's added to the `result` set.\n\n6. Finally, it converts the set to a list and returns it.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Only 39-character substrings are considered\n- Only substrings with no duplicate characters are included\n- Duplicate substrings are automatically removed due to using a set\n- An empty list is returned if no such substrings exist\n\nThe time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and the space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of unique 39-character substrings found.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=145, output_tokens=369))
