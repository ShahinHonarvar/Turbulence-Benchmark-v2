Message(id='msg_01SrTAetxaT1ZzPHLkfusuux', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `all_substring_of_size_n` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    result = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - 22):\n        substring = s[i:i+23]\n        if len(set(substring)) == 23:\n            result.add(substring)\n    return list(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. Create an empty set `result` to store unique substrings.\n\n2. Iterate through the input string `s` using a range from 0 to `len(s) - 22` to ensure we can extract 23-character substrings.\n\n3. For each iteration, extract a substring of length 23 using string slicing.\n\n4. Check if the substring has exactly 23 unique characters by converting it to a set and checking its length.\n\n5. If the substring has 23 unique characters, add it to the `result` set.\n\n6. Finally, convert the set to a list and return it.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Only substrings of exactly 23 characters are considered\n- Only substrings with no duplicate characters are included\n- Duplicate substrings are eliminated by using a set\n- An empty list is returned if no such substrings exist\n\nThe time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and the space complexity is also O(n).", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=145, output_tokens=342))
