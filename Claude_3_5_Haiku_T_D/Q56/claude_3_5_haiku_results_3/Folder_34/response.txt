Message(id='msg_01CexmCwuhE1ESjuHY6z4AzW', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    if len(s) < 84:\n        return []\n    \n    result = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - 83):\n        substring = s[i:i+84]\n        if len(set(substring)) == 84:\n            result.add(substring)\n    \n    return list(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the input string's length is less than 84. If so, it returns an empty list since no 84-character substrings are possible.\n\n2. It creates an empty set `result` to store unique substrings.\n\n3. It iterates through the string, creating substrings of length 84 starting from each possible index.\n\n4. For each substring, it checks if the number of unique characters is exactly 84 by converting the substring to a set and checking its length.\n\n5. If a substring has 84 unique characters, it is added to the `result` set.\n\n6. Finally, it converts the set to a list and returns it.\n\nThe use of a set ensures that only distinct substrings are kept, and the order of substrings in the returned list is not guaranteed, as specified in the problem statement.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=145, output_tokens=313))
