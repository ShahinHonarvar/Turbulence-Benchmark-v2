Message(id='msg_01TiMaY5U572ChtqrsSGNGiC', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s the Python implementation of the `if_contains_anagrams` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(words):\n    anagram_count = 0\n    for i in range(len(words)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):\n            if len(words[i]) >= 3 and len(words[j]) >= 3:\n                if sorted(words[i].lower()) == sorted(words[j].lower()):\n                    anagram_count += 1\n    return anagram_count >= 89\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a list of strings as input.\n2. It initializes an `anagram_count` variable to 0.\n3. It uses nested loops to compare each pair of words in the list.\n4. For each pair, it checks if both words are at least 3 characters long.\n5. If the words are long enough, it converts them to lowercase and checks if their sorted characters are the same.\n6. If they are anagrams, it increments the `anagram_count`.\n7. After checking all pairs, it returns `True` if the `anagram_count` is 89 or more, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe function uses the `sorted()` method to compare the characters of the words, which makes the comparison case-insensitive and order-independent. This approach ensures that words like "listen" and "silent" would be recognized as anagrams.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=146, output_tokens=350))
