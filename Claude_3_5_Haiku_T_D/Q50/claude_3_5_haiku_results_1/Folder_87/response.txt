The function takes a list of strings as input.\n2. It initializes a counter `anagram_count` to keep track of the number of anagram pairs.\n3. It uses nested loops to compare each word with every other word in the list.\n4. Words are converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n5. It checks if both words have a length of at least 3.\n6. If the sorted characters of both words are the same, they are anagrams, and the counter is incremented.\n7. Finally, it returns `True` if the number of anagram pairs is 88 or more, `False` otherwise.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=146, output_tokens=308))
