Message(id='msg_01UpqovA2Q7MMMwKBieEAtuz', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(num):\n    return sum(num * i for i in range(1, 211))\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a single positive integer `num` as an argument\n2. It uses a generator expression to create the first 210 multiples of `num`\n3. The `range(1, 211)` generates numbers from 1 to 210\n4. Each multiple is calculated by multiplying `num` with the numbers in the range\n5. The `sum()` function adds up all these multiples\n6. The total sum of the first 210 multiples is returned\n\nFor example:\n- `find_sum_of_multiples(5)` would return the sum of 5, 10, 15, ..., up to the 210th multiple of 5\n- `find_sum_of_multiples(3)` would return the sum of 3, 6, 9, ..., up to the 210th multiple of 3", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=253))
