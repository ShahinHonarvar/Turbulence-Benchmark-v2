Message(id='msg_017irAu2hsuTirSSaCehZdth', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function `find_sum_of_multiples`:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    return sum(n * i for i in range(1, 408))\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a positive integer `n` as input\n2. It uses a generator expression with `sum()` to calculate the sum of the first 407 multiples of `n`\n3. The range goes from 1 to 408 (exclusive) to generate the first 407 multiples\n4. Each multiple is calculated by multiplying `n` with the current index\n5. `sum()` adds up all these multiples\n6. The total sum is returned\n\nFor example:\n- `find_sum_of_multiples(5)` would return the sum of 5, 10, 15, ..., up to the 407th multiple of 5\n- `find_sum_of_multiples(3)` would return the sum of 3, 6, 9, ..., up to the 407th multiple of 3", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=256))
