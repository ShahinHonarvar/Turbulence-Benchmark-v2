Message(id='msg_01G9XMmpsjRxUaHN8Z8sS9bK', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    return n * 3\n```\n\nThe function `find_sum_of_multiples` takes a positive integer `n` as input. The first two positive multiples of `n` are `n` and `2n`. By summing these two, we get `n + 2n`, which simplifies to `3n`. Therefore, the function returns `n * 3`, which represents the sum of the first two positive multiples of the input integer.\n\nFor example:\n- If `n` is 4, the first two multiples are 4 and 8, and their sum is 12\n- If `n` is 5, the first two multiples are 5 and 10, and their sum is 15\n- If `n` is 7, the first two multiples are 7 and 14, and their sum is 21", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=221))
