It takes a positive integer `n` as input\n2. It uses a generator expression with `sum()` to calculate the sum of the first 63 multiples of `n`\n3. The range starts at 1 and goes up to 64 (exclusive), generating the multiples\n4. Each multiple is calculated by multiplying `n` by the current index `i`\n5. The `sum()` function adds up all the generated multiples\n6. The result is the sum of the first 63 positive multiples of the input number\n\nFor example:\n- `find_sum_of_multiples(3)` would return the sum of 3, 6, 9, ..., 189\n- `find_sum_of_multiples(5)` would return the sum of 5, 10, 15, ..., 315', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=238))
