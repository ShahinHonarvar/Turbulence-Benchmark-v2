Message(id='msg_014N6kJDNQe72NtYgkubk5wZ', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(num):\n    return sum(num * i for i in range(1, 54))\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a positive integer `num` as input\n2. It uses a generator expression with `sum()` to calculate the sum of the first 53 multiples\n3. The range starts from 1 and goes up to 54 (exclusive), which generates 53 multiples\n4. Each multiple is calculated by multiplying the input number `num` with the indices from 1 to 53\n5. The `sum()` function adds up all these multiples\n6. The total sum is returned as the result\n\nFor example:\n- `find_sum_of_multiples(5)` would return the sum of 5, 10, 15, ..., 265\n- `find_sum_of_multiples(7)` would return the sum of 7, 14, 21, ..., 371", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=246))
