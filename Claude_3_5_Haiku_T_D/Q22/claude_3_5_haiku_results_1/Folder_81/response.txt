It takes a positive integer `n` as input\n2. It uses a generator expression with `sum()` to calculate the sum of the first 83 multiples of `n`\n3. The range starts from 1 and goes up to 84 (exclusive) to generate 83 multiples\n4. Each multiple is calculated by multiplying `n` with numbers from 1 to 83\n5. The `sum()` function adds up all these multiples\n6. The result is returned as the sum of the first 83 positive multiples of the given integer", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=188))
