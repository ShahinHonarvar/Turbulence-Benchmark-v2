The `prime_factors` function takes a list of integers as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested `factor` function that calculates the prime factors of a given number:\n   - It starts with the smallest prime number, 2\n   - It repeatedly divides the number by the current divisor if it's divisible\n   - It adds each prime divisor to a set of factors\n   - It increases the divisor after each round of division\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, it adds that number to the factors set\n\n3. The function returns the set of prime factors of the number at index 96 in the input list.\n\nThe function ensures:\n- Only prime factors are included in the returned set\n- Each prime factor appears only once in the set\n- It handles any positive integer as the input number\n- It selects the number at index 96 from the input list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=318))
