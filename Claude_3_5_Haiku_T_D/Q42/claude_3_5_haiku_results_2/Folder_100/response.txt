It defines an inner helper function `factors` that finds the prime factors of a given number\n2. The `factors` function uses trial division to systematically find prime factors\n3. It starts dividing from 2 and continues up to the square root of the number\n4. Whenever a factor is found, it's added to a set and the number is divided by that factor\n5. If a prime factor greater than the square root remains, it's added to the set\n6. The main function returns the prime factors of the number at index 99 in the input list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=255))
