It defines an inner function `factor(n)` that finds the prime factors of a given number.\n2. The `factor` function uses trial division to find prime factors.\n3. It iterates through potential divisors starting from 2.\n4. When a divisor is found, it's added to the set of prime factors.\n5. The number is divided by the divisor until it's no longer divisible.\n6. The process continues until all prime factors are found.\n7. The main `prime_factors` function calls the `factor` function with the number at index 95 of the input list.\n8. It returns the set of prime factors for that number.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=283))
