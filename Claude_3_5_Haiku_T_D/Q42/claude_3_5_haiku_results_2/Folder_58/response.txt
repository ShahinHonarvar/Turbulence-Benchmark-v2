Message(id='msg_01FC9iUhznznnQXXPP5kaUTh', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n    def find_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    \n    return find_prime_factors(nums[714])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested helper function `find_prime_factors` that finds the prime factors of a given number.\n\n3. The `find_prime_factors` function works as follows:\n   - It initializes an empty set `factors` to store the prime factors.\n   - It starts with the smallest prime number, 2, as the divisor.\n   - It repeatedly divides the number by the current divisor if possible, adding the divisor to the factors set.\n   - It increases the divisor and continues until the divisor squared is greater than the number.\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, it means the number itself is prime, so it's added to the factors set.\n\n4. The main function returns the prime factors of the number at index 714 in the input list.\n\nThe function will return a set of prime factors for the number at index 714, satisfying the given specification.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=364))
