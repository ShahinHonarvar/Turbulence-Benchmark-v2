Message(id='msg_01AVmt2LYQ4AqcTsu4vQpBwT', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n    def get_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n\n    return get_prime_factors(nums[72])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested helper function `get_prime_factors` that finds the prime factors of a given number.\n\n3. The `get_prime_factors` method works by:\n   - Starting with the smallest prime number 2\n   - Dividing the number by the current divisor as many times as possible\n   - Adding the divisor to the set of factors\n   - Incrementing the divisor\n   - Stopping when the divisor squared is greater than the number\n   - Adding the remaining number to the factors if it's greater than 1\n\n4. The `prime_factors` function calls `get_prime_factors` with the element at index 72 from the input list.\n\n5. The function returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 72.\n\nThis implementation handles finding prime factors efficiently and returns them as a set to avoid duplicates.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=347))
