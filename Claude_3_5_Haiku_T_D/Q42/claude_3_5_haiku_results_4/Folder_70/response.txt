The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n2. It defines an inner function `find_prime_factors` that calculates the prime factors of a given number.\n3. The `find_prime_factors` function uses trial division to find prime factors:\n   - It starts with the smallest prime number 2 and checks if it divides the number.\n   - If a prime factor is found, it is added to the set of factors.\n   - The number is divided by the prime factor until it's no longer divisible.\n   - It continues checking prime factors up to the square root of the number.\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, it is also a prime factor.\n4. The function returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 845 in the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=320))
