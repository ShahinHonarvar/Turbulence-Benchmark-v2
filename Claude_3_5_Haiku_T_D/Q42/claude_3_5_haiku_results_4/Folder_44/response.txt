The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. Inside it defines a nested `factor` function that finds the prime factors of a given number.\n\n3. The `factor` function works by:\n   - Starting with the smallest prime number, 2\n   - Dividing the number by the current divisor as many times as possible\n   - Adding each prime divisor to a set\n   - Incrementing the divisor\n   - Handling cases where the remaining number is prime\n\n4. It returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 828 in the input list.\n\n5. The function handles large numbers efficiently by stopping factorization when the divisor squared exceeds the remaining number.\n\nThe function will return a set of prime factors for the specific number located at index 828 in the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=325))
