It defines an inner function `factor(n)` that finds all prime factors of a given number\n2. The `factor()` function uses trial division to find prime factors\n3. It iterates through potential divisors up to the square root of the number\n4. When a divisor is found, it is added to the set of factors and the number is divided\n5. If any number greater than 1 remains after division, it is also a prime factor\n6. The main function returns the prime factors of the number located at index 276 of the input list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=244))
