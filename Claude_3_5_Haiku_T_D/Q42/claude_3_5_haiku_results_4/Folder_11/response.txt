The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested `factor` function that calculates the prime factors of a given number.\n\n3. The `factor` function works by:\n   - Starting with the smallest prime number (2)\n   - Repeatedly dividing the number by the current divisor if possible\n   - Adding the divisor to the set of prime factors\n   - Incrementing the divisor\n   - Continuing until the divisor squared is greater than the number\n\n4. If there's a remaining number greater than 1 after the loop, it means that number is also a prime factor, so it's added to the set.\n\n5. The function returns the set of prime factors for the integer at index 77 in the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=303))
