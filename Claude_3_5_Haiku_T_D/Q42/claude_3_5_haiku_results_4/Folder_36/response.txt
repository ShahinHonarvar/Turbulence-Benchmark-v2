The `prime_factors` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested `factor` function that finds the prime factors of a given number.\n3. The `factor` function works by:\n   - Starting with the smallest prime number (2)\n   - Repeatedly dividing the number by the current divisor if it divides evenly\n   - Adding the divisor to the set of prime factors\n   - Increasing the divisor when it no longer divides the number\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, it is added to the set of prime factors\n4. The main function returns the prime factors of the number at index 990 in the input list.\n\nThe function will efficiently find all prime factors of a given number, returning them as a set.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=300))
