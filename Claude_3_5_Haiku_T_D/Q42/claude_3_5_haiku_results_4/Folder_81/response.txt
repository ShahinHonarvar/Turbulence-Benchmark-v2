Message(id='msg_015jS4XFbTQiafcqgbuwXy9m', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def find_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    \n    return find_prime_factors(numbers[20])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n1. It defines an inner function `find_prime_factors` that computes the prime factors of a given number.\n2. The prime factorization algorithm works by:\n   - Starting with the smallest prime number (2)\n   - Repeatedly dividing the number by the current prime factor\n   - Adding the prime factor to a set of factors\n   - Moving to the next potential prime factor\n3. The outer function `prime_factors` takes a list of numbers and returns the prime factors of the number at index 20.\n4. It uses a set to store unique prime factors.\n5. If the remaining number after dividing out all smaller prime factors is greater than 1, it is itself a prime factor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=294))
