The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as its argument.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested `factor` function that finds the prime factors of a given number.\n\n3. The `factor` function works by:\n   - Creating an empty set to store prime factors\n   - Starting with the smallest prime number (2)\n   - Dividing the number repeatedly by the current divisor as long as it divides evenly\n   - Adding the divisor to the set of prime factors each time it divides\n   - Incrementing the divisor\n   - Handling the case where the remaining number is a prime factor greater than the square root\n\n4. The function returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 90 in the input list.\n\n5. If the number at index 90 is prime, the set will contain only that number.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=318))
