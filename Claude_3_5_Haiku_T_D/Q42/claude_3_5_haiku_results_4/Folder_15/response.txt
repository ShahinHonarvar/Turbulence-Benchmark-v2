It defines an inner function `factors` that computes the prime factors of a given number\n2. Inside `factors`, it uses trial division to find prime factors:\n   - It starts dividing by 2 and continues up to the square root of the number\n   - Whenever a factor is found, it's added to the `primes` set\n   - The number is divided by the factor to continue finding other prime factors\n3. If any number larger than 1 remains after division, it's also a prime factor\n4. The function returns the set of prime factors of the number at index 10 from the input list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=260))
