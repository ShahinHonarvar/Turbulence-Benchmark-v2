Message(id='msg_01JfxdYoVpietCDA7CprJ4Ky', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `prime_factors` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def factorize(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while n > 1:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n            if d * d > n:\n                if n > 1:\n                    factors.add(n)\n                break\n        return factors\n    \n    return factorize(numbers[91])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested `factorize` function that finds the prime factors of a given number.\n\n3. The `factorize` function works by:\n   - Starting with the smallest prime number, 2\n   - Dividing the number by the current divisor as many times as possible\n   - Adding the divisor to the set of prime factors each time\n   - Moving to the next potential divisor\n   - Handling cases where the remaining number is a prime larger than the square root\n\n4. The `prime_factors` function calls `factorize` on the number at index 91 of the input list.\n\n5. It returns the set of prime factors for that specific number.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=321))
