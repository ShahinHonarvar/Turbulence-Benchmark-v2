The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. It defines an inner function `find_prime_factors` that finds the prime factors of a given number.\n\n3. Inside `find_prime_factors`:\n   - Initialize an empty set `factors` to store the prime factors.\n   - Start with the smallest prime number, 2, as the divisor.\n   - While the number is greater than 1:\n     - Divide the number by the current divisor as many times as possible.\n     - Add the divisor to the factors set each time it divides the number.\n     - Increase the divisor.\n   - If the divisor squared becomes greater than the number, check if the number itself is prime and add it to the factors if necessary.\n\n4. The main function returns the prime factors of the number at index 126 in the input list.\n\nThis implementation efficiently finds all prime factors of a given number and returns them as a set.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=365))
