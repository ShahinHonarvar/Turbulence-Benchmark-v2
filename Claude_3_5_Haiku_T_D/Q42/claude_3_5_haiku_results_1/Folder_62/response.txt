Define a nested function `factor(n)` that finds the prime factors of a number:\n   - Initialize an empty set `factors` to store unique prime factors\n   - Start with the smallest prime number, 2\n   - While the divisor squared is less than or equal to the number:\n     - If the number is divisible by the current divisor, add the divisor to the factors set and divide the number by the divisor\n     - Increment the divisor\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, add it to the factors set (as it is a prime factor)\n   - Return the set of prime factors\n\n2. In the main `prime_factors` function, call the nested `factor` function on the element at index 926 of the input list and return its prime factors", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=298))
