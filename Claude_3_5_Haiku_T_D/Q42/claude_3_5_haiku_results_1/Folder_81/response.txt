Define an inner function `get_prime_factors` that takes a single number and returns its prime factors:\n   - Create an empty set to store prime factors\n   - Start with the smallest prime number, 2\n   - While the number is greater than 1:\n     - Divide the number by the current divisor as many times as possible\n     - Add the divisor to the prime factors set each time\n     - Move to the next potential divisor\n     - If the divisor squared is greater than the number, add the remaining number to factors if it's greater than 1\n\n2. The main function `prime_factors` takes a list of numbers and calls `get_prime_factors` with the number at index 20\n\n3.
