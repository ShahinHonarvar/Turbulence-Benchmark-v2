Message(id='msg_01NpXDMXDCNSzyo1ffDbyUzZ', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `prime_factors` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def factor(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    \n    return factor(numbers[702])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. Define an inner function `factor(n)` that finds the prime factors of a given number:\n   - Initialize an empty set `factors` to store unique prime factors\n   - Start with the smallest prime number 2\n   - While the divisor squared is less than or equal to the number:\n     - If the number is divisible by the current divisor:\n       - Add the divisor to the factors set\n       - Divide the number by the divisor\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, it is a prime factor itself, so add it to the set\n   - Return the set of prime factors\n\n2. The main `prime_factors` function:\n   - Takes a list of positive integers as input\n   - Returns the prime factors of the integer at index 702 by calling the inner `factor` function", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=313))
