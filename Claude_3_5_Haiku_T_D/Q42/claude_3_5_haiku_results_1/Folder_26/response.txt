Message(id='msg_01QfxULb8Y9awgsCG4gfzJyE', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def find_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while n > 1:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n            if d * d > n:\n                if n > 1:\n                    factors.add(n)\n                break\n        return factors\n\n    return find_prime_factors(numbers[222])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It defines an inner function `find_prime_factors` that takes a single number as input and returns its set of prime factors.\n\n2. Inside `find_prime_factors`, it uses a trial division method to find prime factors:\n   - Start with the smallest prime number, 2\n   - Divide the number by the current divisor as many times as possible\n   - Add the divisor to the set of factors each time it divides evenly\n   - Move to the next potential divisor\n   - If the divisor squared becomes larger than the remaining number, add the remaining number to factors if it's greater than 1\n\n3. The main `prime_factors` function simply calls `find_prime_factors` on the element at index 222 of the input list.\n\n4. The function returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 222.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=334))
