Message(id='msg_017kboAYgoEQmyGTdsEUuDip', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def find_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    \n    return find_prime_factors(numbers[84])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. Define an inner function `find_prime_factors` that takes a single number and returns its set of prime factors.\n   - It uses trial division to find prime factors.\n   - It starts dividing by 2 and continues up to the square root of the number.\n   - Each time a factor is found, it's added to the set and the number is divided by that factor.\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, it means the number itself is prime, so it's added to the set.\n\n2. The main `prime_factors` function takes a list of numbers and returns the prime factors of the number at index 84.\n\n3. It calls the inner `find_prime_factors` function with the number at index 84 from the input list.\n\nThe function will return a set of prime factors for the number at index 84 in the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=333))
