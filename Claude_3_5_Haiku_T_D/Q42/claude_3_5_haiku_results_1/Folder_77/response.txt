The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. It defines an inner function `find_prime_factors` that takes a single number and finds its prime factors:\n   - It initializes an empty set `factors` to store the prime factors.\n   - It starts with the smallest prime number, 2, as the divisor.\n   - It repeatedly divides the number by the current divisor if it's divisible.\n   - When the number is no longer divisible by the current divisor, it increments the divisor.\n   - If the divisor squared becomes greater than the number, it checks if the remaining number is greater than 1 and adds it to the factors if so.\n\n3. The function returns the prime factors of the number at index 985 in the input list.\n\nThe function will return a set of prime factors for the number at index 985 in the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=349))
