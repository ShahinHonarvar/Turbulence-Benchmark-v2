Message(id='msg_012pwtttR2UgvXDLLWDdsi9Y', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def find_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    \n    return find_prime_factors(numbers[276])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n1. Defines an inner function `find_prime_factors` that finds the prime factors of a given number\n2. Uses trial division to identify prime factors\n3. Adds each prime factor to a set to eliminate duplicates\n4. Returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 276 in the input list\n\nThe `find_prime_factors` function works by:\n- Starting with the smallest prime number, 2\n- Dividing the number by prime factors as many times as possible\n- Moving to the next potential prime factor\n- Adding any remaining prime factor greater than 1 to the set of factors\n\nThe function will return a set of prime factors for the number located at index 276 in the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=297))
