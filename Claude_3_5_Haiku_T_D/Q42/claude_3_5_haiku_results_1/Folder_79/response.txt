Message(id='msg_018dqtVPk5d36K6XDQHS2QQ4', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n    def factor(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    \n    return factor(nums[63])\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It defines an inner function `factor(n)` that finds prime factors of a given number.\n2. The `factor` function uses trial division to find prime factors:\n   - It starts with the smallest prime number, 2\n   - It repeatedly divides the number by its smallest prime factor\n   - It adds each prime factor to a set\n   - If any number remains after trial division, it is added as a prime factor\n3. The `prime_factors` function calls `factor` on the 64th element (index 63) of the input list\n4. It returns the set of prime factors for that specific number\n\nThe function will work for any list of positive integers with at least 64 elements, returning the set of prime factors of the number at index 63.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=301))
