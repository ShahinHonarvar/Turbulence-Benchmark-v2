Define the main function `prime_factors` that takes a list of numbers as an argument.\n\n2. Inside the function, define a nested helper function `factor` that finds the prime factors of a given number:\n   - Initialize an empty set `factors` to store unique prime factors\n   - Start with the smallest prime number 2 as the divisor\n   - While the divisor squared is less than or equal to the number:\n     - If the number is divisible by the divisor, add the divisor to factors and divide the number by the divisor\n     - If not divisible, increment the divisor\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, it is a prime factor itself, so add it to the factors\n   - Return the set of prime factors\n\n3. Call the `factor` function on the number at index 35 of the input list and return its prime factors.\n\nThe function handles finding all prime factors of a given number and works correctly for the specific requirement of returning the prime factors of the number at index 35.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=351))
