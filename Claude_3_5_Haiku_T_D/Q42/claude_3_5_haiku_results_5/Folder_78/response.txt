Message(id='msg_01Krq7nhdYihTQBgQa1pwcqV', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def find_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while n > 1:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n            if d * d > n:\n                if n > 1:\n                    factors.add(n)\n                break\n        return factors\n    \n    return find_prime_factors(numbers[91])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as an argument.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested helper function `find_prime_factors` that finds the prime factors of a given number.\n\n3. The `find_prime_factors` function works as follows:\n   - It creates an empty set to store the prime factors.\n   - It starts with the smallest prime number, 2, as the divisor.\n   - It repeatedly divides the number by the current divisor if it's divisible.\n   - When a divisor can no longer divide the number, it increments the divisor.\n   - If the divisor squared becomes greater than the number, it adds the remaining number to the factors if it's greater than 1.\n\n4. The main function calls `find_prime_factors` with the number at index 91 of the input list.\n\n5. It returns the set of prime factors for that number.\n\nThis implementation ensures that:\n- It works with a list of positive integers\n- It specifically finds the prime factors of the number at index 91\n- It returns a set of unique prime factors\n- It handles large numbers efficiently", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=409))
