The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as its argument.\n2. It defines an inner function `factor` that finds the prime factors of a given number:\n   - It starts with the smallest prime number, 2\n   - It divides the number by each potential prime factor as many times as possible\n   - It adds each prime factor to a set\n   - If any number greater than 1 remains after the process, it is added as a prime factor\n3. The function returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 276 in the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=252))
