Message(id='msg_01WFeSzka5HnMFPNhWdXszH7', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def find_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n\n    return find_prime_factors(numbers[828])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested helper function `find_prime_factors` that finds the prime factors of a given number:\n   - It initializes an empty set `factors` to store unique prime factors.\n   - It starts with the smallest prime number, 2, as the divisor.\n   - It repeatedly divides the number by the current divisor if possible, adding the divisor to the set of factors.\n   - It increments the divisor and continues until the divisor squared is greater than the number.\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, it means the number itself is prime, so it's added to the factors.\n\n3. The main function calls `find_prime_factors` with the element at index 828 of the input list and returns its prime factors.\n\nThis implementation ensures that:\n- Only prime factors are returned\n- Duplicate factors are eliminated (by using a set)\n- It works with the element specifically at index 828 of the input list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=375))
