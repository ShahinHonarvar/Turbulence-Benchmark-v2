Message(id='msg_01JfTtFAnTtbHd8r51MNRMCb', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def find_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    \n    return find_prime_factors(numbers[312])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested helper function `find_prime_factors` that computes the prime factors of a given number:\n   - It uses trial division to find prime factors\n   - It starts dividing by 2 and increments the divisor\n   - It adds each prime factor to a set to ensure uniqueness\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1 after trial division, it adds that number as a prime factor\n\n3. The function returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 312 in the input list.\n\n4. If the input list has fewer than 313 elements, it will raise an IndexError.\n\nThe function will return a set of all unique prime factors of the number located at index 312 in the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=328))
