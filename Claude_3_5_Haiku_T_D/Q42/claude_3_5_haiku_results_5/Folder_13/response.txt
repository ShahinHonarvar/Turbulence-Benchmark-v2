The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as its argument.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested `factor` function that finds the prime factors of a given number:\n   - It initializes an empty set to store unique prime factors.\n   - It starts with the smallest prime number, 2, as the divisor.\n   - It repeatedly divides the number by the current divisor when possible, adding the divisor to the factors set.\n   - When the divisor no longer divides the number, it increments the divisor.\n   - If the divisor squared becomes greater than the number, it checks if the remaining number is greater than 1 (which would be a prime factor).\n\n3. The function returns the set of prime factors of the number at index 126 in the input list.\n\nThe implementation efficiently finds all prime factors of a given number, ensuring that only unique prime factors are included in the result.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=347))
