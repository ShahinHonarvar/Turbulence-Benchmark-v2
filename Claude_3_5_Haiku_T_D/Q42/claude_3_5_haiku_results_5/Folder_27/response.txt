Define a nested function `factor(n)` that finds prime factors for a given number:\n   - It initializes an empty set to store prime factors\n   - It starts dividing the number by the smallest prime (2)\n   - It continues dividing by the same prime as long as possible\n   - It moves to the next potential prime factor\n   - If a prime factor larger than the square root remains, it adds that to the factors\n   - It returns a set of all prime factors\n\n2. The main `prime_factors` function:\n   - Takes a list of numbers as input\n   - Calls the `factor` function on the number at index 56\n   - Returns the set of prime factors for that number\n\nThe function handles cases where the input number might be prime itself, composite, or have multiple prime factors.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=299))
