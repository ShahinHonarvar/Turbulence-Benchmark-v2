It defines an inner function `factor` that finds all prime factors of a given number\n2. The `factor` function works by:\n   - Starting with divisor 2\n   - Dividing the number by the divisor as many times as possible\n   - Adding the divisor to the set of factors each time\n   - Incrementing the divisor\n3. If any remainder greater than 1 is left after the loop, it is a prime factor\n4. The main function returns the prime factors of the number at index 702 in the input list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=246))
