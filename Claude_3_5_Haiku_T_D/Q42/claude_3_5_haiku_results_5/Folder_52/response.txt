It takes a list of positive integers as input\n2. It defines an inner function `factor` that computes the prime factors of a given number\n3. The `factor` function uses trial division to find prime factors:\n   - Start dividing by 2\n   - For each divisor, add it to the factors set and divide the number\n   - If the divisor is larger than the square root of the number and the number is greater than 1, it means the number itself is prime\n4. The function returns the set of prime factors of the number at index 478 in the input list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=258))
