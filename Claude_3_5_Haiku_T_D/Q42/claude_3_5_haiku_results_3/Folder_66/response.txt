The outer function `prime_factors` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. An inner function `factor` is defined to compute the prime factors of a single number:\n   - It uses trial division to find prime factors\n   - It starts dividing by the smallest prime number (2)\n   - It keeps dividing by the same prime factor as long as possible\n   - When a prime factor is found, it's added to a set\n   - The process continues until the square of the current divisor exceeds the number\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, it is itself a prime factor\n\n3. The function returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 42 in the input list.\n\n4. The implementation ensures that only unique prime factors are returned by using a set.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=304))
