Define an inner function `find_prime_factors` that takes a number and returns its set of prime factors.\n   - Start with the smallest prime number, 2.\n   - While the number is greater than 1:\n     - If the number is divisible by the current divisor, add the divisor to the factors and divide the number by the divisor.\n     - If not divisible, increment the divisor.\n     - If the divisor squared is greater than the number, and the number is still greater than 1, add the number itself as a prime factor and break.\n\n2. The `prime_factors` function takes a list of numbers and returns the prime factors of the number at index 66 by calling `find_prime_factors` with `numbers[66]`.\n\nThe function will work with a list of positive integers and return the set of prime factors for the number at index 66.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=344))
