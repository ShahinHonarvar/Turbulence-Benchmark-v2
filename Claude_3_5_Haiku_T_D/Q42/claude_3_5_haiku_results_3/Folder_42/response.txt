Message(id='msg_01StbSHW4YYjUoZJCNyXPWuR', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `prime_factors` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def find_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    \n    return find_prime_factors(numbers[276])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested helper function `find_prime_factors` that calculates the prime factors of a given number.\n\n3. The `find_prime_factors` method works by:\n   - Starting with the smallest prime number 2\n   - Dividing the number by the current divisor as many times as possible\n   - Adding the divisor to the set of prime factors when it divides the number\n   - Incrementing the divisor\n   - Continuing until the divisor squared is greater than the number\n   - Adding the remaining number to the set of prime factors if it's greater than 1\n\n4. The function returns the prime factors of the number at index 276 in the input list.\n\n5. The prime factors are returned as a set to ensure uniqueness.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=333))
