Message(id='msg_01MerwRXevzw9X8GkMaFc9aU', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `prime_factors` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    def find_prime_factors(n):\n        factors = set()\n        d = 2\n        while d * d <= n:\n            while n % d == 0:\n                factors.add(d)\n                n //= d\n            d += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            factors.add(n)\n        return factors\n    \n    return find_prime_factors(numbers[985])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as its argument.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested helper function `find_prime_factors` that finds the prime factors of a given number:\n   - It initializes an empty set `factors` to store the prime factors.\n   - It starts with the smallest prime number, 2, as the divisor.\n   - It checks divisibility of the number by the current divisor.\n   - If divisible, it adds the divisor to the `factors` set and divides the number by the divisor.\n   - It continues this process until the divisor's square is greater than the number.\n   - If the remaining number is greater than 1, it means it's a prime factor itself, so it's added to the set.\n\n3. The function returns the prime factors of the number at index 985 in the input list.\n\nThe function will find the prime factors of the number located at index 985 in the input list and return them as a set.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=367))
