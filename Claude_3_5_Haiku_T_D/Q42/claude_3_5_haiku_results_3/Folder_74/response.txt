Defines an inner function `find_prime_factors` that takes a number and returns its prime factors as a set.\n2. The prime factorization algorithm works by:\n   - Starting with the smallest prime number (2)\n   - Repeatedly dividing the number by the current prime factor\n   - Adding each prime factor to the set\n   - Incrementing the prime factor\n3. The main function takes a list of numbers and returns the prime factors of the number at index 48.\n4. If the remaining number is greater than 1 after trial division, it is a prime factor itself and is added to the set.\n5. The function returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 48.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=298))
