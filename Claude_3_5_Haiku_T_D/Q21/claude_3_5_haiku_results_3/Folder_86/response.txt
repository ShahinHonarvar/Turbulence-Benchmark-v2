It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` from index 44 to index 73 (the slice `nums[44:74]` ensures this range).\n2. It checks each number in this range to see if it's divisible by 88 using the modulo operator `%`.\n3. If a number is divisible by 88 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it's included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by 88 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=192))
