Message(id='msg_01SqaPjkSgZja5wng4v57Xdm', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[:1] if num % 7 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. It uses a list comprehension to filter the list\n3. `nums[:1]` slices the list to include only the first element (from index 0 to index 0, inclusive)\n4. `num % 7 == 0` checks if the number is divisible by 7\n5. If no numbers are divisible by 7 in the first element, an empty list is returned\n6. If the first element is divisible by 7, it is included in the result list\n\nThe function will return:\n- An empty list if the list is empty\n- An empty list if the first element is not divisible by 7\n- A list with the first element if it is divisible by 7", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=239))
