Message(id='msg_01CvcUuSBwhSMsSNA14zXmkL', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers[50:55] if num % 84 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a list of integers as an argument\n2. It uses a list comprehension to filter the sublist from index 50 to 54 (both inclusive)\n3. It selects only the numbers that are divisible by 84 (using the modulo operator `%`)\n4. If no numbers are divisible by 84 in that range, an empty list will be returned\n5. It returns the list of integers divisible by 84\n\nThe slice `numbers[50:55]` ensures that we look at indices 50, 51, 52, 53, and 54, which matches the specification of "index 50 to index 54, both inclusive".', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=220))
