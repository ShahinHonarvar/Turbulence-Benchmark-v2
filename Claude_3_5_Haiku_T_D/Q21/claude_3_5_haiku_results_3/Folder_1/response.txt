It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list from index 59 to 77 (inclusive)\n2. It checks each number to see if it is divisible by -95 using the modulo operator\n3. If a number is divisible by -95, it is included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers are divisible by -95 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe slicing `numbers[59:78]` ensures that the range from index 59 to 77 is checked, and the condition `num % -95 == 0` checks divisibility by -95.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=205))
