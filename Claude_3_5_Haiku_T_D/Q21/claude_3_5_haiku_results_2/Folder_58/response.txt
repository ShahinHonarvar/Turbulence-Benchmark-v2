Message(id='msg_013Bj96PSaRTV4daEu1PW6kP', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst[255:619] if num % 965 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 255 to 618 (inclusive)\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it is divisible by 965 using the modulo operator\n4. If a number is divisible by 965 (remainder is 0), it is included in the result list\n5. If no numbers are divisible by 965 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function matches the requirements by checking only the specified range of indices and only returning integers divisible by 965.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=201))
