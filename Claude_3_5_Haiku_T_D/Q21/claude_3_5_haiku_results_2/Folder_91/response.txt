Message(id='msg_012NHvpiHDtm7kMgiurhM5it', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[:1] if num % 5 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. It uses a list comprehension to slice the first element of the list (nums[:1])\n3. It checks if each number in this slice is divisible by 5 using the modulo operator (%)\n4. If the number is divisible by 5, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers are divisible by 5 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets the requirements by only checking the first element (index 0) and returning a list of integers divisible by 5 from that slice.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=202))
