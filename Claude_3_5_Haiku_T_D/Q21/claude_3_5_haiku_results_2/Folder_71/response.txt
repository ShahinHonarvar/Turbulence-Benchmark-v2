Message(id='msg_01EZaTgHHJtUJGFvSVab7eAj', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst[29:52] if num % -37 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 29 to index 51 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by -37 using the modulo operator %.\n3. If a number is divisible by -37, it's included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by -37 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe slice `lst[29:52]` ensures that we're looking at elements from index 29 to index 51, both inclusive.\nThe condition `num % -37 == 0` checks divisibility by -37.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=218))
