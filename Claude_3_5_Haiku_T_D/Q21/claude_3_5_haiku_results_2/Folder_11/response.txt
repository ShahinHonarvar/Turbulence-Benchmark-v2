Message(id='msg_012bV9QuGUR1HF4mh7t9Rnez', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[22:64] if num % -61 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 22 to 63 (both inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in the slice to see if it's divisible by -61 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by -61 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it's included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers in the specified range are divisible by -61, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- It takes a list of integers as input\n- It extracts the sublist from index 22 to 63\n- It returns only the integers divisible by -61\n- It returns an empty list if no such integers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=235))
