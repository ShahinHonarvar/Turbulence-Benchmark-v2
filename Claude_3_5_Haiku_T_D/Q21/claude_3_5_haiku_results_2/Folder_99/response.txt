It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 161 to 970 (inclusive)\n2. It checks each number in the slice to see if it's divisible by 763 using the modulo operator %\n3. If a number is divisible by 763 (remainder is 0), it's included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers are divisible by 763 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n5. The function works with any list of integers passed as an argument", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=184))
