Message(id='msg_0138UkLnbaraKoSKgm5cVRcB', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[:3] if num % 3 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the first three elements of the input list (slice `nums[:3]`)\n2. It checks if each number is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator `%`\n3. If a number is divisible by 3 (remainder is 0), it is included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers in the first three indices are divisible by 3, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function handles different input scenarios:\n- If the input list has fewer than 3 elements, it will only check the available elements\n- If no elements in the first 3 indices are divisible by 3, it returns an empty list\n- It works with both positive and negative integers", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=228))
