Message(id='msg_01GHJTHDbvht2S1t93tzv1Hk', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[572:807] if num % -158 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a list of integers as input (`nums`)\n2. Uses list comprehension to filter the sublist from index 572 to 807 (inclusive)\n3. Checks each number in the sublist to see if it's divisible by -158\n4. Returns a list of numbers that meet the divisibility condition\n5. If no numbers are divisible by -158 in the specified range, an empty list will be returned\n\nThe slicing `nums[572:807]` ensures that only elements from index 572 to 806 (inclusive) are considered, which matches the requirement. The modulo operation `num % -158 == 0` checks for divisibility by -158.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=222))
