Message(id='msg_01LfgEY6BxFeAqQadGiuWoXj', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[73:83] if num % -57 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 73 to 82 (note that slice end is exclusive, so 83 is used to include index 82)\n2. It checks each number in this slice to see if it's divisible by -57 (using the modulo operator %)\n3. If a number is divisible by -57, it's included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers are divisible by -57 in the specified range, an empty list will be returned\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as an argument\n- Checks only the integers from index 73 to 82 (inclusive)\n- Returns only the integers divisible by -57\n- Returns an empty list if no such integers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=246))
