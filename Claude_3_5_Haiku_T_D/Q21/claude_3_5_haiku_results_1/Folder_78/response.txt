It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 57 to 67 (inclusive)\n2. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by 90 using the modulo operator (%)\n3. If a number is divisible by 90, it is included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers are divisible by 90 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as input\n- Checks only the range from index 57 to 67 (inclusive)\n- Returns a list of integers divisible by 90 in that range\n- Returns an empty list if no such integers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=232))
