Message(id='msg_01KfRCcbJmkMH4GsW9vAevNr', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[18:39] if num % -97 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. Uses a list comprehension to filter the sublist from index 18 to 38 (inclusive)\n3. Checks if each number in the slice is divisible by -97 using the modulo operator\n4. Returns a list of integers that meet the divisibility condition\n5. If no numbers are divisible by -97 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe slice `nums[18:39]` selects elements from index 18 up to but not including index 39, which effectively covers indices 18 to 38.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=205))
