Message(id='msg_018ZXr763apPYxtEytK1qJXP', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[:1] if num % 8 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a list of integers\n2. It only considers the first element of the input list (nums[:1])\n3. It checks if each number is divisible by 8 using the modulo operator (% 8 == 0)\n4. If no number is divisible by 8, it will return an empty list\n5. If a number is found that is divisible by 8, it will be included in the returned list\n\nThe function will meet the specified requirements:\n- It takes a list of integers as input\n- It checks divisibility by 8\n- It only looks at the first element (index 0)\n- It returns an empty list if no divisible integers are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=226))
