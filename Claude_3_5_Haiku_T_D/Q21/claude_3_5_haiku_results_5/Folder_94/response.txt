Message(id='msg_01Hi8VS5KvP7hih2TPdzJWSn', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[18:94] if num % -85 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` from index 18 to index 93 (note that slicing `nums[18:94]` includes index 18 up to but not including index 94, which matches the inclusive range specification).\n2. For each number in this slice, it checks if the number is divisible by -85 using the modulo operator `%`.\n3. If a number is divisible by -85 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by -85 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Taking a list of integers as input\n- Slicing the list from index 18 to 93 (inclusive)\n- Filtering for numbers divisible by -85\n- Returning the filtered list (or an empty list if no such numbers exist)", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=279))
