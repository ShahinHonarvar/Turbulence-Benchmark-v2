Message(id='msg_01TfyiNN9vLMJLkNgkMzPBgA', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[75:86] if num % -40 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 75 to 85 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by -40 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by -40 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by -40 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- It takes a list of integers as an argument\n- It looks at the range from index 75 to 85 (inclusive)\n- It returns a list of numbers divisible by -40 within that range\n- If no such numbers exist, it returns an empty list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=248))
