It takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. It uses a list comprehension to slice the list from index 33 to 36 (inclusive of indices 33, 34, and 35)\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by 91 using the modulo operator `%`\n4. If a number is divisible by 91 (remainder is 0), it's included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers are divisible by 91 in the specified range, an empty list is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=195))
