It takes a list of integers as an input\n2. Uses a list comprehension to filter the list from index 161 to 970 (971 is exclusive)\n3. Checks each number in the specified range for divisibility by 763\n4. Returns a list of all numbers divisible by 763 within that range\n5. If no numbers are divisible by 763 in the range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function will work for lists of any length, and if the input list has fewer than 971 elements, it will simply return an empty list or any divisible numbers that exist within the list's range.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=204))
