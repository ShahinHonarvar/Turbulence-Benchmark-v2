Message(id='msg_01RGnrVttdhjzufBCbUt2Lt6', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers[255:619] if num % 965 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Takes a list of integers as input\n2. Uses list comprehension to slice the list from index 255 to 618 (inclusive)\n3. Checks each number in that range for divisibility by 965\n4. Returns a list of all numbers divisible by 965 within that range\n5. Returns an empty list if no such numbers exist\n\nThe slice `numbers[255:619]` includes indices from 255 to 618, which matches the requirement of "from index 255 to index 618, both inclusive".\n\nThe condition `num % 965 == 0` checks if each number is divisible by 965 by verifying that the remainder of the division is zero.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=219))
