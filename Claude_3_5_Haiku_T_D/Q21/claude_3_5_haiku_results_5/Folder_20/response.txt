It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 73 to 82 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in this slice to see if it is divisible by -57 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by -57 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers in the specified range are divisible by -57, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=177))
