Message(id='msg_01CZNob9LEPhe7qR4a1rvVSm', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[:1] if num % 6 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a list of integers `nums` as input.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to:\n   - Slice the list to include only the first element (from index 0 to index 0 with `nums[:1]`)\n   - Check if the element is divisible by 6 using the modulo operator `%`\n3. If the first element is divisible by 6, it will be included in the returned list.\n4. If the first element is not divisible by 6, an empty list will be returned.\n5. If the input list is empty, an empty list will also be returned.\n\nThe function meets the requirements of checking only the first element (from index 0 to index 0) for divisibility by 6 and returning the appropriate result.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=243))
