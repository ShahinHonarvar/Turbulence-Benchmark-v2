It takes a list of integers `nums` as input.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list.\n3. It slices the input list from index 75 to 89 (which is index 88 inclusive).\n4. It checks each number in this slice to see if it's divisible by -27 using the modulo operator `%`.\n5. If a number is divisible by -27 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it's included in the returned list.\n6. If no numbers are divisible by -27 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function will work with lists of any length, and if the input list is shorter than 89 elements, it will simply return any matching numbers within the available range or an empty list if no numbers match.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=250))
