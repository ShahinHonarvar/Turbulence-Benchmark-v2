Takes a list of integers as input\n2. Uses a list comprehension to slice the input list from index 12 to index 33 (inclusive)\n3. Filters the sliced list to include only numbers divisible by -91\n4. Returns the resulting list\n5. If no numbers are divisible by -91 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe modulo operator `%` checks divisibility. When the remainder of a number divided by -91 is zero, it means the number is divisible by -91.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=185))
