Message(id='msg_01NN19Lb7h31RXvun4aamirr', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[1:9] if num % 6 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` from index 1 to index 8 (both inclusive).\n2. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by 6 using the modulo operator `%`.\n3. If a number is divisible by 6, it is included in the resulting list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by 6 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function meets the requirements of taking a list of integers as input and returning a list of integers divisible by 6 from index 1 to 8, or an empty list if no such integers exist.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=216))
