Message(id='msg_016GbvxDFNjKynVNUHYuAjLz', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[315:353] if num % -858 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 315 to 352 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in this slice to see if it's divisible by -858 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by -858 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it's included in the resulting list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by -858 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe slice `nums[315:353]` ensures that we're looking at elements from index 315 to 352, both inclusive, due to Python's slicing behavior.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=218))
