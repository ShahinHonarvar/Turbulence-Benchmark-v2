Message(id='msg_01JFXn9VGzVR44G4Her9y3qG', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[36:47] if num % 28 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to filter the sublist of `nums` from index 36 to 46 (inclusive)\n2. It checks each number in the sublist to see if it is divisible by 28 using the modulo operator `%`\n3. If a number is perfectly divisible by 28 (remainder is 0), it is included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers are divisible by 28 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets the requirements by:\n- Taking a list of integers as an argument\n- Checking only the sublist from index 36 to 46\n- Returning only integers divisible by 28\n- Returning an empty list if no such integers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=234))
