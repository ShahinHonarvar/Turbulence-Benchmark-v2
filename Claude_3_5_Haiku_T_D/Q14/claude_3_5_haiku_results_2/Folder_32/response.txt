Message(id='msg_01P4hoFEegzb241DGNNTGdcL', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n    if len(nums) < 36:\n        return None\n    \n    sublist = nums[32:36]\n    \n    if len(sublist) < 2:\n        return None\n    \n    try:\n        smallest = min(sublist)\n        sublist.remove(smallest)\n        return min(sublist)\n    except ValueError:\n        return None\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the input list has at least 36 elements. If not, it returns `None`.\n\n2. It creates a sublist containing elements from index 32 to 35 (inclusive) using list slicing.\n\n3. It checks if the sublist has at least 2 elements. If not, it returns `None`.\n\n4. It finds the smallest element in the sublist using the `min()` function.\n\n5. It removes the smallest element from the sublist.\n\n6. It then finds and returns the new smallest element (which is the second smallest from the original sublist).\n\n7. If any error occurs during the process (such as trying to remove an element that doesn't exist), it returns `None`.\n\nThis implementation ensures that:\n- It works only with a list of distinct numbers\n- It specifically looks at the sublist from index 32 to 35\n- It returns the second smallest number in that sublist\n- It returns `None` if the conditions cannot be met", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=122, output_tokens=350))
