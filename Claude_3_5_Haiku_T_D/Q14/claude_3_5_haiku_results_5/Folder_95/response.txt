Message(id='msg_01XUJDbDXkGMjUVKuX8BJdVf', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(numbers):\n    if len(numbers) < 86:\n        return None\n    \n    segment = numbers[75:86]\n    \n    if len(segment) < 2:\n        return None\n    \n    try:\n        first_smallest = min(segment)\n        segment.remove(first_smallest)\n        return min(segment)\n    except ValueError:\n        return None\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the input list has at least 86 elements. If not, it returns `None`.\n\n2. It extracts a slice of the list from index 75 to index 85 (inclusive) using `numbers[75:86]`.\n\n3. It checks if the extracted segment has at least 2 elements. If not, it returns `None`.\n\n4. It finds the smallest element in the segment using `min()`.\n\n5. It removes the first smallest element from the segment.\n\n6. It then finds the minimum of the remaining segment, which will be the second smallest element.\n\n7. If any error occurs during this process (such as if all elements are the same), it returns `None`.\n\nThe function satisfies the requirements by:\n- Taking a list of distinct numbers as input\n- Focusing on the segment from index 75 to 85 (inclusive)\n- Returning the second smallest number in that segment\n- Returning `None` if there is no second smallest number or if the list is too short", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=122, output_tokens=356))
