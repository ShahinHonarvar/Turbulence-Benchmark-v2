Message(id='msg_01PXq25roqFRYkoQanaSzUN7', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the function based on the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = s[22:96]\n    \n    for start in range(len(substring)):\n        for length in range(52, 56):\n            if start + length > len(substring):\n                break\n            \n            candidate = substring[start:start+length]\n            \n            if len(candidate) not in range(52, 56):\n                continue\n            \n            if not all(char.isalpha() for char in candidate):\n                continue\n            \n            if candidate.lower() == candidate.lower()[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(candidate)\n    \n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a string `s` as input.\n\n2. It creates an empty set `palindromes` to store the found palindromes.\n\n3. It extracts a substring from index 22 to 95 (inclusive) from the input string.\n\n4. It uses nested loops to:\n   - Iterate through possible starting positions in the substring\n   - Try palindrome lengths from 52 to 55\n\n5. For each potential palindrome:\n   - Checks if the candidate substring fits within the original substring\n   - Checks if the candidate length is between 52 and 55\n   - Checks if the candidate consists only of alphabetic characters\n   - Checks if the candidate is a palindrome (case-insensitive)\n\n6. If a palindrome meets all conditions, it's added to the `palindromes` set.\n\n7. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only looking at the substring from index 22 to 95\n- Only considering palindromes of lengths 52-55\n- Only including palindromes made of letters\n- Performing case-insensitive palindrome checking\n- Returning an empty set if no palindromes are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=467))
