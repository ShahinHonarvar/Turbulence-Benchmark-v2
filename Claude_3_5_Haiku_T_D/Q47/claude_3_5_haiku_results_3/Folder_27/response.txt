Message(id='msg_011w6KMZUKqtke9wypzhihVL', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = s[13:100].lower()\n    \n    for length in range(26, 30):\n        for i in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            candidate = substring[i:i+length]\n            if all(char.isalpha() for char in candidate):\n                if candidate == candidate[::-1]:\n                    palindromes.add(candidate)\n    \n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. Create an empty set `palindromes` to store the results.\n\n2. Extract the substring from index 13 to 99 (inclusive) and convert it to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n\n3. Iterate through possible palindrome lengths from 26 to 29 (both inclusive):\n   - For each length, slide a window of that length across the substring\n   - Check if all characters in the candidate substring are alphabetic\n   - Check if the candidate is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse\n   - If it's a palindrome, add it to the `palindromes` set\n\n4. Return the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only considering the substring from index 13 to 99\n- Only considering palindromes with lengths between 26 and 29\n- Ensuring all characters in the palindrome are letters\n- Performing palindrome check in a case-insensitive manner\n- Returning an empty set if no palindromes are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=383))
