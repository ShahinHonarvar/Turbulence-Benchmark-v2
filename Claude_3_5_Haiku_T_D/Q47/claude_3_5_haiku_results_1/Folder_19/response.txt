Message(id='msg_01EG5byxcJFBQQ98cuLmjbYg', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = s[10:56].lower()\n    \n    for length in range(3, 8):\n        for start in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            candidate = substring[start:start+length]\n            \n            if candidate == candidate[::-1] and candidate.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(candidate)\n    \n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It takes a string `s` as input.\n2. It creates an empty set `palindromes` to store the found palindromes.\n3. It extracts the substring from index 10 to 55 (inclusive) and converts it to lowercase for case-insensitive checking.\n4. It iterates through palindrome lengths from 3 to 7.\n5. For each length, it checks all possible substrings of that length within the extracted substring.\n6. It checks if each substring is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.\n7. It also checks that the candidate substring contains only alphabetic characters using `isalpha()`.\n8. If a substring meets all conditions, it is added to the `palindromes` set.\n9. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=323))
