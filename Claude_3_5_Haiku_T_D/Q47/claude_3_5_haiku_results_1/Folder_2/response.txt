Message(id='msg_01FGeZJEZssSXVaoeYoMU4Wf', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    result = set()\n    substr = s[10:60].lower()\n    \n    for length in range(18, 37):\n        for start in range(len(substr) - length + 1):\n            candidate = substr[start:start+length]\n            \n            if len(candidate) == length and all(char.isalpha() for char in candidate):\n                if candidate == candidate[::-1]:\n                    result.add(candidate)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It initializes an empty set called `result` to store the palindromes.\n\n2. It extracts the substring from index 10 to 59 (inclusive) and converts it to lowercase to perform a case-insensitive search.\n\n3. It iterates through palindrome lengths from 18 to 36.\n\n4. For each length, it checks all possible substrings of that length within the specified substring.\n\n5. For each candidate substring, it checks two conditions:\n   - The substring length matches the specified length\n   - All characters in the substring are English letters\n\n6. If a candidate meets these conditions, it checks if the substring is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.\n\n7. If a palindrome is found, it is added to the `result` set.\n\n8. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function meets all the specified requirements: case-insensitive search, specific index range, specific length range, and only allowing palindromes composed of English letters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=374))
