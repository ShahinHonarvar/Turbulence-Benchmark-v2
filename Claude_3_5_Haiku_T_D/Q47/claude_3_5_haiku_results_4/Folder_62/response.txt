Takes a string `s` as input\n2. Extracts a substring from index 26 to 87 (inclusive) and converts it to lowercase\n3. Iterates through palindrome lengths from 52 to 56\n4. Checks each substring of those lengths within the extracted substring\n5. Adds to the result set palindromes that:\n   - Are exactly equal to their reverse\n   - Consist only of alphabetic characters\n6.
