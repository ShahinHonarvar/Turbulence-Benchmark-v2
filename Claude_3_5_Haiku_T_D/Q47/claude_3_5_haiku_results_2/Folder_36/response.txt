Message(id='msg_01VR4V7FyEDbNhjXfZzxbmdi', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    result = set()\n    substring = s[124:284]\n    \n    for length in range(115, 135):\n        for start in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            candidate = substring[start:start+length]\n            \n            if candidate.isalpha() and candidate.lower() == candidate.lower()[::-1]:\n                result.add(candidate)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It extracts the substring from index 124 to 283 (inclusive) from the input string.\n\n2. It iterates through palindrome lengths from 115 to 134 (inclusive).\n\n3. For each length, it checks every possible substring of that length in the extracted substring.\n\n4. For each candidate substring, it checks two conditions:\n   - The substring contains only alphabetic characters (using `isalpha()`)\n   - The substring is a palindrome when compared case-insensitively\n\n5. If a candidate substring meets both conditions, it is added to the result set.\n\n6. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nThe implementation ensures that:\n- Only palindromes in the specified index range are considered\n- Only palindromes of specified lengths are considered\n- Only palindromes consisting of English letters are included\n- The palindrome check is case-insensitive\n- If no palindromes are found, an empty set is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=354))
