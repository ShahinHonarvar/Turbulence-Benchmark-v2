Message(id='msg_01VgDzGu6AhyXktVH7RY1uNi', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = s[10:75].lower()\n    \n    for length in range(6, 9):\n        for i in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            candidate = substring[i:i+length]\n            if len(candidate) >= 6 and len(candidate) <= 8 and candidate == candidate[::-1] and candidate.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(candidate)\n    \n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It creates an empty set called `palindromes` to store the unique palindromes found.\n\n2. It extracts the substring from index 10 to index 74 (inclusive) and converts it to lowercase to perform case-insensitive matching.\n\n3. It iterates through possible palindrome lengths from 6 to 8 (inclusive).\n\n4. For each length, it slides a window across the substring to check each possible substring.\n\n5. For each candidate substring:\n   - Checks if its length is between 6 and 8\n   - Checks if it reads the same forwards and backwards (is a palindrome)\n   - Checks if it consists only of alphabetic characters\n\n6. If a substring meets all these conditions, it is added to the `palindromes` set.\n\n7. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes found.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=351))
