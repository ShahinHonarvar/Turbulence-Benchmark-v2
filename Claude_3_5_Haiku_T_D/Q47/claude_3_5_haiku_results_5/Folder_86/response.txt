Message(id='msg_01R665SPZyhhWQXXiaYaiABK', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = s[30:96]\n    \n    for length in range(34, 56):\n        for start in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            candidate = substring[start:start+length]\n            \n            if candidate.isalpha() and candidate.lower() == candidate.lower()[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(candidate)\n    \n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a string `s` as input.\n\n2. It extracts a substring from index 30 to 95 (inclusive) using string slicing.\n\n3. It iterates through palindrome lengths from 34 to 55.\n\n4. For each length, it generates all possible substrings of that length within the extracted substring.\n\n5. It checks each substring to ensure:\n   - It consists only of alphabetic characters\n   - It is a palindrome (case-insensitive)\n\n6. If a substring meets both conditions, it is added to the `palindromes` set.\n\n7. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Restricting the search to the specific substring\n- Filtering palindromes by length\n- Ensuring only alphabetic palindromes are included\n- Performing case-insensitive palindrome matching\n- Returning an empty set if no palindromes are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=358))
