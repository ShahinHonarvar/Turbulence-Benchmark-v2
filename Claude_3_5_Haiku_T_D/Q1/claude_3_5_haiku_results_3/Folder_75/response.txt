It takes a list of integers as its input argument.\n2. It uses Python's list slicing with the start index of 56 and the end index of 99 (which returns elements up to, but not including, index 99).\n3. It returns a new list containing all elements from index 56 to index 98, both inclusive.\n\nThe function will work correctly as long as the input list has at least 99 elements. If the input list has fewer than 99 elements, it will return as many elements as possible from index 56 onwards.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=171))
