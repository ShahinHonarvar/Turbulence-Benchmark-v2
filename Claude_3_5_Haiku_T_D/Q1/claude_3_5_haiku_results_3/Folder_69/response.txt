It takes a single argument `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers\n2. It uses list slicing with indices 21 and 98 to return all elements from index 21 to index 97 (inclusive)\n3. The slicing `[21:98]` means start at index 21 and go up to, but not including, index 98, which effectively includes indices 21 through 97\n\nThe function will work with any list of integers, returning the specified slice, and if the input list is shorter than required, it will simply return whatever elements are available within that range.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=180))
