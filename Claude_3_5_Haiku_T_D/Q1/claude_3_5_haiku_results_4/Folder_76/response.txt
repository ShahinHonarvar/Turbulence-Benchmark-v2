If the input list is shorter, it will return all available elements from index 661 onwards, or an empty list if 661 is beyond the list's length.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=180))
