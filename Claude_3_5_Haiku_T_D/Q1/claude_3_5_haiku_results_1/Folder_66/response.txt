If the input list has fewer than 51 elements, it will return whatever elements are available from index 22 onwards, or an empty list if the list is too short.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=182))
