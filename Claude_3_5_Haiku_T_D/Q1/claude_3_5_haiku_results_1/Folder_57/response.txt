Takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. Uses list slicing to return elements from index 62 to index 92 (inclusive)\n   - The slicing `[62:93]` starts at index 62 and goes up to, but not including, index 93\n   - This effectively includes indices 62 through 92, which is exactly 31 elements\n\nThe function will work for any list of integers that has at least 93 elements. If the input list is shorter, it will return as many elements as possible without raising an error.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=168))
