Message(id='msg_01P8hWLfi2Rx8c1pdj1SC3mX', content=[TextBlock(text='```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    return set(x for x in set(list1[90:201]) & set(list2[90:201]))\n```\n\nThis solution does the following:\n1. Slice both input lists from index 90 to 201 (inclusive)\n2. Convert these slices to sets\n3. Use set intersection (&) to find common elements\n4. Return the set of common elements\n5. If no common elements exist, an empty set will be returned\n6. Works with lists of any size, as long as they are at least 201 elements long\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Using a slice of [90:201] to capture elements from index 90 to 200 inclusive\n- Converting the slices to sets to efficiently find common elements\n- Returning an empty set if no common elements are found\n- Preserving the order and uniqueness of elements is not required, so a set is used', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=129, output_tokens=221))
