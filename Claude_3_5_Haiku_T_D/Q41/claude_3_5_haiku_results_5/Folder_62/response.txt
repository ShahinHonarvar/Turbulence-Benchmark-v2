Message(id='msg_01VV2B7nXB1AZbQxC9mAp16u', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `identical_elements` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    return set(list1[91:100]) & set(list2[91:100])\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Takes two lists as arguments\n2. Slices both lists from index 91 to 100 (which includes indices 91-99)\n3. Converts these slices to sets\n4. Uses the `&` (intersection) operator to find common elements\n5. Returns the set of common elements between the sliced lists\n6. If no common elements exist, an empty set is returned\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- It takes two lists of the same size\n- It looks at elements only between indices 91 and 99 (inclusive)\n- It returns a set of elements that occur in both lists\n- If no common elements exist, it returns an empty set", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=129, output_tokens=218))
