Message(id='msg_0133uaE8w4D4dtZnQBD6oh8P', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    result = set(list1[40:201]) & set(list2[40:201])\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input arguments\n2. It uses list slicing to extract elements from index 40 to 200 (inclusive) from both lists\n3. It converts these sliced lists to sets\n4. It uses the set intersection operator `&` to find common elements\n5. If no common elements are found, an empty set is returned\n6. The common elements are returned as a set\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- It works with lists of the same size\n- It checks elements only between index 40 and 200 (inclusive)\n- It returns a set of elements that occur in both lists within that range\n- It returns an empty set if no common elements are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=129, output_tokens=230))
