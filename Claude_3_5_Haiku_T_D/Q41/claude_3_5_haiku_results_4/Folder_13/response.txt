It uses list slicing `list1[25:88]` and `list2[25:88]` to extract the sublists from index 25 to 87 (inclusive).\n2. It converts these sublists to sets using `set()`.\n3. It uses the set intersection operator `&` to find the common elements between these two sets.\n4. If no common elements are found, an empty set will be returned.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Only elements between index 25 and 87 (inclusive) are considered\n- The returned value is a set of unique common elements\n- If no common elements exist in the specified range, an empty set is returned\n- The function works with lists of the same size (as specified in the requirement)", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=129, output_tokens=232))
