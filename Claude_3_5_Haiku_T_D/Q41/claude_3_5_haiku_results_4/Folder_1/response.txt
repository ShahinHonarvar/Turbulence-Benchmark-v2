The `&` operator performs a set intersection, which returns a new set containing elements that appear in both sets.\n5. If no common elements exist, an empty set is automatically returned.\n\nThe function will work with lists of any type, as long as they are the same size and support set conversion. It directly returns the set of elements that occur in both lists within the specified index range.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=129, output_tokens=222))
