If no common elements exist, an empty set is returned automatically\n\nThe function will work with lists of any size, as long as both lists have at least 94 elements. If either list is shorter than 94 elements, it will simply return an empty set or handle the slice within the list's actual length.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=129, output_tokens=239))
