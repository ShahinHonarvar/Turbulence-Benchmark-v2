Create a set of characters to remove by iterating through the substring from index 78 to 87 (exclusive) and selecting characters that are greater than ';' and less than 'r'.\n2. Use a list comprehension to create a new string by including only characters that are not in the set of characters to remove.\n3. Return the altered string while maintaining the original order of characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=152, output_tokens=182))
