It iterates through the characters in the string from index 59 to 81 (indices 58 to 82 exclusive).\n2. If a character is lexicographically between 'F' and 'O', it is added to a list of characters to remove.\n3. It then removes all occurrences of these characters from the string while maintaining the original order.\n4. Finally, it returns the modified string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=153, output_tokens=220))
