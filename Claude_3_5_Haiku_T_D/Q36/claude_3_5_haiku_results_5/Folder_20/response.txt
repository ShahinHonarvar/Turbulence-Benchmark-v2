It identifies characters between indices 13 and 40 (exclusive) that are greater than ':' and smaller than 'C'.\n2. It creates a set of these characters that need to be removed.\n3. It constructs a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, thus preserving the original order.\n4. It returns the new string with the specified characters removed.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=151, output_tokens=189))
