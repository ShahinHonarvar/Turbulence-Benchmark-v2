It checks if the input string has at least 27 characters.\n2. It identifies characters between indices 22 and 24 (exclusive of indices 21 and 25).\n3. If a character is greater than '5' and smaller than '}', it is added to a list of characters to remove.\n4. A new string is constructed by keeping only characters not in the list of characters to remove.\n5. The order of remaining characters is preserved.\n6. The modified string is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=151, output_tokens=266))
