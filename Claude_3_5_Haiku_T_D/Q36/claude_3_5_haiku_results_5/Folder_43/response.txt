It creates a set of characters within the specified range (indices 28 to 74) that are greater than 'A' and smaller than 'i'.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to create a new string by including only those characters that are not in the set of characters to be removed.\n3. The order of the remaining characters is preserved.\n4.
