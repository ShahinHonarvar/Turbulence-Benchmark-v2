Creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterates through the string's characters from index 32 to 69 (exclusive of 70).\n3. If a character is between 'B' and 'v', it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n4. Creates a new string `result` by joining only those characters that are not in `chars_to_remove`.\n5. Returns the modified string, maintaining the original order of characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=153, output_tokens=244))
