It first creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. It iterates through the characters of the string at indices 1 and 2 (between 0 and 3, exclusive).\n3. If a character is greater than '$' and less than '?', it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n4. It then creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, effectively removing all occurrences of those characters while maintaining the original order.\n5. The modified string is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=150, output_tokens=254))
