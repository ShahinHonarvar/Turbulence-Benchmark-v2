Create an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterate through the characters in the string from index 47 to 73 (from the 47th to the 73rd character).\n3. If a character is greater than '&' and smaller than 'M', add it to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n4. Create a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set.\n5. Return the altered string while maintaining the original order of characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=152, output_tokens=250))
