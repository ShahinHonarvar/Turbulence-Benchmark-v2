Message(id='msg_014BkJvhUz1bQ1dR2cCvVVyb', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `filter_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(58, 69):\n        if '(' < s[i] < 'W':\n            chars_to_remove.add(s[i])\n    \n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterates through characters at indices 58 to 68 (which corresponds to the indices between 57 and 69 as specified).\n3. For each character, checks if it is greater than '(' and smaller than 'W'.\n4. If the condition is true, adds the character to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n5. Uses a list comprehension to create a new string that excludes all characters in the `chars_to_remove` set.\n6. Returns the modified string, maintaining the original order of characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=151, output_tokens=262))
