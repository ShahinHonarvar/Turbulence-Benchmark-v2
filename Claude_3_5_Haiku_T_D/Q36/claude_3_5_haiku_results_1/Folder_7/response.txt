Creates an empty list `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed\n2. Iterates through the string from index 503 to 945 (exclusive of 946)\n3. If a character is between 'W' and 'y', it is added to `chars_to_remove`\n4. Goes through each character in `chars_to_remove` and removes all occurrences from the string\n5. Returns the modified string, maintaining the original order of characters", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=153, output_tokens=235))
