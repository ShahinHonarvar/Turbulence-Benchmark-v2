Creates a set of characters between indices 155 and 222 (exclusive) that are greater than 'A' and smaller than 'f'\n2. Uses a list comprehension to keep only the characters that are not in the set of characters to remove\n3. Joins the filtered characters back into a string and returns it\n\nThe function preserves the original order of characters while removing all occurrences of the specified characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=153, output_tokens=189))
