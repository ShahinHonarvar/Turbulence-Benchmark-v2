Identifies characters between indices 69 and 97 (exclusive)\n2. Checks if each character is greater than 'V' and less than 'j'\n3. If a character meets the condition, it is added to a set of characters to remove\n4. Creates a new string by keeping only characters not in the set to remove\n5. Preserves the original order of characters in the string\n6. Returns the modified string", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=153, output_tokens=221))
