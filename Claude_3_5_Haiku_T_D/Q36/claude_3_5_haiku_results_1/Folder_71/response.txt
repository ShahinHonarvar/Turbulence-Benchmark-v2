It creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. It iterates through the characters of the string between indices 83 and 89 (exclusive).\n3. For each character in this range, if the character is greater than '*' and smaller than '[', it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n4. It then creates a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, maintaining the original order.\n5. Finally, it returns the altered string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=149, output_tokens=253))
