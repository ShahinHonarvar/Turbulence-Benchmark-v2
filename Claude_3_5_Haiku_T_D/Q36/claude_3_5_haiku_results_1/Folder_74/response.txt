Message(id='msg_01XiXo3gG7JAStc3tk3z99cQ', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s the Python implementation of the `filter_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = []\n    for i in range(34, 36):\n        if \'>\' < s[i] < \'A\':\n            chars_to_remove.append(s[i])\n    \n    for char in chars_to_remove:\n        s = s.replace(char, \'\')\n    \n    return s\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It checks characters at indices 34 and 35 (indices 33 to 36 exclusively).\n2. If a character is greater than \'>\' and smaller than \'A\', it\'s added to a list of characters to remove.\n3. Then, it removes all occurrences of those characters from the string.\n4. The original order of characters in the string is maintained.\n5. The modified string is returned.\n\nFor example:\n- If the input is "hello123>?@world", it would remove the characters that meet the specified condition.\n- If the input is "abc>?@def", the function would return the string after removing characters that meet the condition.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=151, output_tokens=273))
