Message(id='msg_01ScCkXhv7Dcqg3KAo25PbBz', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `filter_chars` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(text):\n    if len(text) <= 87:\n        return text\n    \n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(82, 86):\n        if '!' < text[i] < 's':\n            chars_to_remove.add(text[i])\n    \n    result = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char not in chars_to_remove:\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. If the input string's length is 87 or less, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It creates a set of characters to remove by checking characters at indices 82 to 85 (since the specification mentions indices 81 to 86 exclusive).\n\n3. If a character in this range is greater than '!' and smaller than 's', it is added to the set of characters to remove.\n\n4. It then creates a new list `result` by iterating through the original string and only adding characters that are not in the set of characters to remove.\n\n5. Finally, it joins the `result` list into a string and returns it.\n\nThis ensures that all occurrences of the specified characters are removed while maintaining the original order of the remaining characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=150, output_tokens=322))
