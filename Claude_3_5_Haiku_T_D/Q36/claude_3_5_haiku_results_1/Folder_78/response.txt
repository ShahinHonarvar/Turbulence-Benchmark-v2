If the string length is 34 or less, it returns the original string unchanged.\n2. It creates a set of characters to remove by checking characters at indices 30, 31, and 32.\n3. For each character in this range that is greater than '%' and less than 'a', it is added to the set of characters to remove.\n4. It creates a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the set of characters to remove, thus maintaining the original order.\n5. The resulting string is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=151, output_tokens=257))
