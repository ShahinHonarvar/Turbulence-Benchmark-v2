If the string is 4 characters or shorter, it returns the original string.\n2. It creates a set of characters to be removed by checking characters at indices 4 to 7 (between indices 3 and 8, exclusive).\n3. A character is added to the set of characters to remove if it is greater than '?' and less than 'k'.\n4. It then creates a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the set to be removed, maintaining the original order.\n5. The modified string is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=151, output_tokens=255))
