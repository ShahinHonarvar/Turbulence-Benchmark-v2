It creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. It iterates through the characters in the string from index 70 to 96 (indices 69 to 97 exclusive).\n3. For each character in this range, if the character is lexicographically between 'V' and 'j', it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n4. It then creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, maintaining the original order.\n5. Finally, it returns the modified string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=153, output_tokens=257))
