Extracts the characters at indices 71, 72, and 73 (between 70 and 74, exclusive) into a set.\n2. Creates a new list of characters that either:\n   - Are not in the set of characters between indices 71-73, or\n   - Are not in the range between 'A' and 'U'\n3. Joins the filtered characters back into a string and returns it.\n\nThe function ensures that any character between indices 71-73 that is between 'A' and 'U' is completely removed from the string while maintaining the original order of the other characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=153, output_tokens=242))
