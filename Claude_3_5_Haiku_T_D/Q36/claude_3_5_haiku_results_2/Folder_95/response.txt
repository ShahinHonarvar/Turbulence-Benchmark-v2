Creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterates through the string indices from 57 to 85 (exclusive of 56 and 86).\n3. For each character at those indices, checks if it's greater than '+' and less than 'w'.\n4. If a character meets the condition, it's added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n5. Creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, preserving the original order.\n6. Returns the altered string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=151, output_tokens=244))
