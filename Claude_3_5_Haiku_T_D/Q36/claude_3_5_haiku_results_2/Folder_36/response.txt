Creates a set of characters between indices 284 and 484 (exclusive) that are greater than 'l' and smaller than 't'.\n2. Uses a list comprehension to construct a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the set of characters to be removed.\n3. Returns the modified string while preserving the original order of characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=152, output_tokens=175))
