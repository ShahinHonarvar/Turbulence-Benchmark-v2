The function iterates backwards from `x-1` to 2.\n\n4. For each number, it first checks if it contains no zero.\n\n5. It then checks if the number is left-truncatable by repeatedly removing the leftmost digit and checking if each resulting number is prime.\n\n6. If a number passes both the zero and primality checks, it is added to the result list.\n\n7. The result list is returned in descending order by default due to the backwards iteration.\n\nThe code checks for left-truncatable primes by first ensuring there are no zeros, and then verifying that each number formed by successively removing the leftmost digit is also prime.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=162, output_tokens=446))
