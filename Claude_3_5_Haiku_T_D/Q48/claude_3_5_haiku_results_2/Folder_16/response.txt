Extract the values at indices 90 and 97 from the input tuple and store them as `a` and `b` respectively.\n\n2. Create a list `missing_nums` that contains all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the sublist of the tuple from index 90 to 97.\n\n3. If `missing_nums` is empty (meaning all integers between `a + 1` and `b - 1` are present in the specified range), return an empty string.\n\n4. Calculate the sum of the missing numbers.\n\n5. If the sum is odd, convert the sum to its binary representation using `bin()` and remove the '0b' prefix using slicing.\n\n6. If the sum is even, convert the sum to its hexadecimal representation using `hex()` and remove the '0x' prefix using slicing.\n\n7. Return the resulting string representation.\n\nThe function satisfies all the specified requirements:\n- It takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n- It calculates the sum of missing integers between indices 90 and 97.\n- It returns the binary representation for odd sums and hexadecimal representation for even sums.\n- It handles the case where all numbers in the range are present by returning an empty string.\n- The representations do not have prefixes and start with the most significant digit.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=302, output_tokens=477))
