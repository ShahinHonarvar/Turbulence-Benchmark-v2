Extract `a` as the integer at index 36 and `b` as the integer at index 85 from the input tuple.\n\n2. Create a list of missing numbers between `a + 1` and `b - 1` (both exclusive) that are not present in the slice of the tuple between indices 36 and 85.\n\n3. If there are no missing numbers, return an empty string.\n\n4. Calculate the sum of the missing numbers.\n\n5. If the sum is odd, return its binary representation without the '0b' prefix.\n\n6. If the sum is even, return its hexadecimal representation without the '0x' prefix.\n\nThe implementation meets all the specified requirements, including handling the range of integers, checking for missing numbers, and converting the sum to the appropriate representation based on whether it's odd or even.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=302, output_tokens=343))
