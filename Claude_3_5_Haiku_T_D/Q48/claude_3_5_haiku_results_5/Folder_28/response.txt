Message(id='msg_01HsXkjgSXNL7rVSfjC8pZEa', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup[86]\n    b = tup[99]\n    \n    missing = [x for x in range(a + 1, b) if x not in tup[86:100]]\n    \n    if not missing:\n        return ''\n    \n    sum_missing = sum(missing)\n    \n    if sum_missing % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_missing)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_missing)[2:]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Extracts the values at indices 86 and 99 from the input tuple and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively.\n\n2. Creates a list comprehension `missing` that finds all integers in the range `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both exclusive) that are not present in the slice of the tuple from index 86 to 99.\n\n3. If the `missing` list is empty (meaning all integers in the specified range are present in the tuple), it returns an empty string.\n\n4. Calculates the sum of all missing integers.\n\n5. If the sum is odd, it returns the binary representation of the sum without the '0b' prefix by slicing the string returned by `bin()` starting from the third character.\n\n6. If the sum is even, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum without the '0x' prefix by slicing the string returned by `hex()` starting from the third character.\n\nThe function will handle the requirements of converting the sum to binary or hexadecimal based on its parity and returning the appropriate representation.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=302, output_tokens=400))
