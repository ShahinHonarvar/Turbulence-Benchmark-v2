Extract the values at index 1 and 8 from the input tuple and store them as `a` and `b` respectively.\n\n2. Create a set of excluded numbers from the subarray of the tuple between indices 1 and 8.\n\n3. Calculate the sum of numbers in the range (a + 1, b) that are not in the excluded set.\n\n4. If the sum is zero (meaning all numbers in the range are present in the tuple), return an empty string.\n\n5. If the sum is odd, return the binary representation of the sum (without the '0b' prefix).\n\n6. If the sum is even, return the hexadecimal representation of the sum (without the '0x' prefix).\n\nThe function meets all the specified requirements:\n- It takes a sorted tuple of distinct nonnegative integers\n- Calculates the sum of missing integers in the specified range\n- Returns binary for odd sums and hexadecimal for even sums\n- Removes prefixes from binary and hexadecimal representations\n- Returns an empty string if all integers in the range are present", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=302, output_tokens=406))
