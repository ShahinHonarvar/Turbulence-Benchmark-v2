It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by varying start and end rows and columns.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the sum of all elements equals -10.\n4. If a submatrix with a sum of -10 is found, it is added to the result list.\n5. Finally, it returns the list of submatrices with a sum of -10, or an empty list if no such submatrix exists.\n\nThe function uses numpy's slicing and sum functions to efficiently compute submatrices and their sums.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=315))
