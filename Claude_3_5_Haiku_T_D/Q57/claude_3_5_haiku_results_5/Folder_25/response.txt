It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by varying the start and end rows and columns.\n3. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum using `np.sum()`.\n4. If the sum of the submatrix is exactly -20, it converts the submatrix to a list and adds it to the result list.\n5. If no submatrix with a sum of -20 is found, an empty list is returned.\n6. The function returns a list of all submatrices that have a sum of -20.\n\nThe nested loops ensure that all possible submatrices are checked, and the function handles matrices of different sizes.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=336))
