It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. It determines the number of rows and columns in the matrix.\n3. It initializes an empty list `result` to store submatrices that meet the condition.\n4. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n5. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum using `np.sum()`.\n6. If the sum of the submatrix is exactly 616, it converts the submatrix to a list and appends it to the `result`.\n7. Finally, it returns the list of submatrices that have a sum of 616, or an empty list if no such submatrix is found.\n\nThe time complexity is O(m²n²), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=362))
