It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by varying the start and end row and column indices.\n3. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum using `np.sum()`.\n4. If the sum of a submatrix is exactly -57, it adds that submatrix to the result list.\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, it returns the list of submatrices with a sum of -57.\n6. If no submatrices are found with a sum of -57, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function uses numpy to efficiently slice the matrix and calculate the sum of submatrices.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=327))
