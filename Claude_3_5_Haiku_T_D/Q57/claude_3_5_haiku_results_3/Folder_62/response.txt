It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n3. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum of all elements.\n4. If the sum of the submatrix is exactly 394, it converts the submatrix to a list and adds it to the result list.\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, it returns the list of submatrices that have a sum of 394.\n6. If no submatrix with a sum of 394 is found, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=309))
