It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices of the input matrix.\n3. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum using `np.sum()`.\n4. If the sum of a submatrix equals -128, that submatrix is added to the `result` list.\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, the function returns the list of submatrices with a sum of -128.\n6. If no submatrices are found with a sum of -128, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function covers all possible submatrices by using four nested loops:\n- `r1` and `r2` define the row start and end\n- `c1` and `c2` define the column start and end\n\nThe submatrix generation is done using numpy's slicing: `matrix[r1:r2+1, c1:c2+1]`", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=378))
