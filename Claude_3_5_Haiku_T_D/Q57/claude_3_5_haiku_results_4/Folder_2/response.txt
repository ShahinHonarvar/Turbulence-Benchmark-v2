It takes a two-dimensional NumPy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different starting and ending rows and columns.\n3. For each generated submatrix, it calculates the sum using `np.sum()`.\n4. If the sum of the submatrix is exactly -863, it adds the submatrix to the `result` list.\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, it returns the `result` list.\n6. If no submatrices with a sum of -863 are found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(m²n²), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=333))
