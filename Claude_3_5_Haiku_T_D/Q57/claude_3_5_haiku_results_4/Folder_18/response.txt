It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the sum of all elements equals 616.\n4. If a submatrix with a sum of 616 is found, it is added to the result list.\n5. Finally, it returns the list of submatrices with a sum of 616, or an empty list if no such submatrices exist.\n\nThe function works with the following characteristics:\n- It considers all possible submatrices of the input matrix\n- It uses numpy's slicing to extract submatrices\n- It uses `np.sum()` to calculate the sum of each submatrix\n- The comparison is done with the exact value of 616\n- It returns a list of numpy arrays representing the submatrices with sum 616", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=373))
