The function takes a two-dimensional NumPy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by iterating through different starting and ending row and column indices.\n3. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum using `np.sum()`.\n4. If the sum of the current submatrix is exactly 394, the submatrix is converted to a list and added to the `result` list.\n5. Finally, it returns the list of submatrices that have a sum of 394.\n6. If no such submatrix is found, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=312))
