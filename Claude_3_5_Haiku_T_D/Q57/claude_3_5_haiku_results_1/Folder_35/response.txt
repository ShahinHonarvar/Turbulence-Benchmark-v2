It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. Uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by varying start and end rows and columns.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the sum of all elements is exactly 432.\n4. If a submatrix with sum 432 is found, it is converted to a list and added to the result list.\n5. If no submatrices are found with sum 432, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function will work with numpy matrices of any size and will return all submatrices that meet the sum condition.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=305))
