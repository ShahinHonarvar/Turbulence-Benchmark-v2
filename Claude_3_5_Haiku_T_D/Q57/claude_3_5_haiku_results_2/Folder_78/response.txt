It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end row and column indices.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the sum of all elements equals 17.\n4. If a submatrix with a sum of 17 is found, it's added to the result list.\n5. Finally, it returns the list of submatrices that satisfy the condition.\n\nThe function allows for overlapping and nested submatrices, and it includes submatrices of all possible sizes from 1x1 to the full matrix size.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=302))
