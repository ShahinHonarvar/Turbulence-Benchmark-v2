It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n3. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum using `np.sum()`.\n4. If the sum of a submatrix is exactly -10, it adds that submatrix to the result list.\n5. Finally, it returns the list of all submatrices with a sum of -10.\n\nNote that the function uses numpy to handle matrix operations efficiently and to easily extract submatrices.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=298))
