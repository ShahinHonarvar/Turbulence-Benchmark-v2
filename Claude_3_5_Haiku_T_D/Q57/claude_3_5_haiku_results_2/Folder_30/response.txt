It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end row and column indices.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the sum of all elements equals 21.\n4. If a submatrix with a sum of 21 is found, it is added to the result list.\n5. Finally, it returns the list of all submatrices with a sum of 21, or an empty list if no such submatrix exists.\n\nThe function works by systematically generating all possible rectangular submatrices and checking their sum against the target value of 21.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=308))
