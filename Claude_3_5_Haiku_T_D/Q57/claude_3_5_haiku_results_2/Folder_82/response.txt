The function takes a 2D numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n3. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum using `np.sum()`.\n4. If the sum of a submatrix is exactly -27, that submatrix is added to the `result` list.\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, the function returns the list of submatrices with a sum of -27.\n6. If no submatrix is found with a sum of -27, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=310))
