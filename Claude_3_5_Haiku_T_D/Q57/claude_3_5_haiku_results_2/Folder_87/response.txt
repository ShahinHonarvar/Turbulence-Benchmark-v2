Message(id='msg_01Xqk4DiR2EAift6b3kGNuCR', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    result = []\n    \n    for r1 in range(rows):\n        for r2 in range(r1, rows):\n            for c1 in range(cols):\n                for c2 in range(c1, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[r1:r2+1, c1:c2+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == 35:\n                        result.append(submatrix.tolist())\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by varying the start and end rows and columns.\n\n3. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum using `np.sum()`.\n\n4. If the sum of the submatrix is exactly 35, it converts the submatrix to a list and adds it to the `result` list.\n\n5. If no submatrices with a sum of 35 are found, an empty list is returned.\n\n6. The submatrices are returned as lists of lists to match the specification.\n\nThe time complexity is O(m²n²), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, as it checks all possible submatrices.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=349))
