Defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as its argument\n3. It directly accesses the elements at indices 64 and 28 of the input list\n4. Calls the `gcd` function with those two numbers\n5. Returns the greatest common factor between the two numbers at those specific indices\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently calculate the GCD by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=212))
