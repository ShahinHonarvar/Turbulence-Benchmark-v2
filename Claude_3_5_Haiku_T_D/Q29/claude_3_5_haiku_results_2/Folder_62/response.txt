It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. It takes the list of numbers as an argument\n3. It calls the `gcd` function with the numbers at indices 51 and 31\n4. It returns the greatest common factor of those two numbers\n\nThe `gcd` function works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of division until the remainder is zero, at which point the last non-zero number is the GCD.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=199))
