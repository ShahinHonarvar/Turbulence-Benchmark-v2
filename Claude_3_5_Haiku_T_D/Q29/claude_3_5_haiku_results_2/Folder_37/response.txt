Defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (or factor) using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. Takes a list of positive integers as input\n3. Specifically uses the values at indices 29 and 74 from the input list\n4. Applies the `gcd` function to those two numbers\n5. Returns the greatest common factor between those two numbers\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero number is the GCD.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=214))
