Define an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n2. The `gcd` function takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, and repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0.\n\n3. When `b` becomes 0, `a` is the GCD, which is then returned.\n\n4. The main function `gcf_two_nums` calls `gcd` with the numbers at indices 87 and 95 from the input list.\n\n5. The function returns the greatest common factor of the two specified numbers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=243))
