It takes a list of positive integers as input, selects the first two numbers from the list, and returns their GCF. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division until the remainder becomes zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=143))
