It defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (factor) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The function takes a list of positive integers `nums` as input.\n3. It returns the GCF of the integers at indices 51 and 27 by calling the `gcd` function with those two specific elements.\n4. The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero.\n5. When the remainder becomes zero, the last non-zero number is the greatest common factor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=224))
