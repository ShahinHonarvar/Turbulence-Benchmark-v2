It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers.\n2. The `gcd` function repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number and takes the remainder until the remainder is zero.\n3. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of numbers as its argument.\n4. It directly calls the `gcd` function with the numbers at indices 84 and 13 from the input list.\n5. It returns the greatest common factor of those two numbers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=212))
