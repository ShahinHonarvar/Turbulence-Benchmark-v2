It defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. It returns the GCD of the integers at indices 184 and 307 in the input list by calling the `gcd` function with those two specific numbers.\n3. The implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number and takes the remainder until the remainder becomes zero.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 308 elements and contains only positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=214))
