Defines a nested helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. Takes a list of positive integers as input\n3. Calls the `gcd` function with the values at indices 860 and 307\n4. Returns the greatest common factor of those two numbers\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently find the GCF (or GCD) by repeatedly taking the remainder until the remainder becomes zero, at which point the last non-zero value is the greatest common factor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=202))
