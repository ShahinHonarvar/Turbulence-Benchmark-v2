Message(id='msg_01BufcDW4DeXf64vFvWN9Emd', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python function to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    return gcd(nums[84], nums[21])\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n   - The algorithm repeatedly replaces the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number.\n   - When the remainder becomes 0, the last non-zero number is the GCD.\n\n2. The main function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n3. It directly calls the `gcd` function with the elements at indices 84 and 21 from the input list.\n\n4. It returns the greatest common factor of these two numbers.\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently calculate the GCD, which is equivalent to the greatest common factor (GCF).", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=259))
