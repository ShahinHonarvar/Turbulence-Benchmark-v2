It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. It takes the list of numbers as an argument\n3. It selects the numbers at indices 78 and 93 from the list\n4. It calls the `gcd` function with those two numbers\n5. It returns the greatest common factor of those two numbers\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero number is the greatest common divisor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=218))
