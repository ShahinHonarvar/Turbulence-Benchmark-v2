Defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. Takes a list of positive integers as input\n3. Uses the `gcd` function to find the greatest common factor between the integers at indices 46 and 13\n4. Returns the result of the GCD calculation\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently calculate the greatest common factor between two numbers by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and taking the remainder until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=203))
