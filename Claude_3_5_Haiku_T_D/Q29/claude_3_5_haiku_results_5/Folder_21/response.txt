The function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input\n2. It uses an inner helper function `gcd` that implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common factor\n3. It specifically finds the GCF of the elements at indices 198 and 212\n4. The Euclidean algorithm efficiently calculates the greatest common divisor (which is equivalent to the greatest common factor)\n5. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of its division by the smaller number until the remainder is zero", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=207))
