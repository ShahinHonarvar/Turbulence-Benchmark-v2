It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. It takes a list `nums` as input\n3. It directly accesses the integers at indices 47 and 97 of the list\n4. It calls the `gcd` function with those two integers\n5. It returns the greatest common factor of the two numbers\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently calculate the greatest common factor, which works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and taking the remainder until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=212))
