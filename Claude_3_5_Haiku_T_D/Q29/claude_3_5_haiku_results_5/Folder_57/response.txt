It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. It takes a list of positive integers as input.\n3. It finds the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 28 and 49 by calling the `gcd` function with those specific elements.\n4. It returns the greatest common factor.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=216))
