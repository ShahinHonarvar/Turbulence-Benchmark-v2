It takes a list of positive integers as an argument\n2. It defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm\n3. It returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 95 and 73 by calling the `gcd` function with those specific list elements\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=209))
