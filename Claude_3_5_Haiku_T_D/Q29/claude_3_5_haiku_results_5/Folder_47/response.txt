Message(id='msg_01F1nfXcmepGbxeXqFPS4W5Z', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `gcf_two_nums` function:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    return gcd(nums[28], nums[17])\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The `gcd` function takes two numbers and repeatedly applies the modulo operation until the remainder is zero.\n3. The main function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as an argument.\n4. It directly calls the `gcd` function with the numbers at indices 28 and 17 from the input list.\n5. It returns the greatest common factor (GCD) of those two numbers.\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently calculate the greatest common divisor, which is the same as the greatest common factor (GCF).", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=249))
