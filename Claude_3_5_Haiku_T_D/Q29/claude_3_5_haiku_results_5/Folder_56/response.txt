It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (factor) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as an argument.\n3. It uses the `gcd` function to find the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 84 and 13.\n4. It returns the greatest common factor.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=225))
