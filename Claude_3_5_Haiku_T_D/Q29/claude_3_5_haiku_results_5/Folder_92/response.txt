Takes a list of positive integers as input\n2. Extracts the first two elements of the list at indices 0 and 1\n3. Uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common factor (GCF)\n4. Returns the GCF of those two numbers\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and taking the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=176))
