Define an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n2. In the main `gcf_two_nums` function, call the `gcd` function with the numbers at indices 224 and 663 from the input list.\n3. Return the greatest common factor of those two numbers.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 664 elements and contains only positive integers. The Euclidean algorithm efficiently calculates the GCD by repeatedly taking the modulo until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=234))
