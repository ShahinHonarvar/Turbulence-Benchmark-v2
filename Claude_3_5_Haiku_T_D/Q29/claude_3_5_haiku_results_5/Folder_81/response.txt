It defines an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (factor) of two numbers.\n2. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n3. It returns the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 20 and 83 by calling the `gcd` function with those specific list elements.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common factor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=218))
