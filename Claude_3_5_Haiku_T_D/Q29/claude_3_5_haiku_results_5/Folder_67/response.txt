Message(id='msg_01MiLB3iqkug2up8s8NXNdtv', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `gcf_two_nums` function:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    return gcd(nums[64], nums[28])\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n2. The `gcd` function works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as its argument.\n\n4. It directly calls the `gcd` function with the elements at indices 64 and 28 from the input list.\n\n5. The function returns the greatest common factor (GCD) of these two numbers.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 65 elements (since it accesses indices 64 and 28) and contains only positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=265))
