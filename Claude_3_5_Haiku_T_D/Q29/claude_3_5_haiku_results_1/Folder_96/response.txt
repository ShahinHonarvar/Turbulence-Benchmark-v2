Define an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (same as greatest common factor) of two numbers.\n\n2. In the main function `gcf_two_nums`, directly access the numbers at indices 95 and 73 from the input list.\n\n3. Call the `gcd` function with these two numbers and return the result.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=241))
