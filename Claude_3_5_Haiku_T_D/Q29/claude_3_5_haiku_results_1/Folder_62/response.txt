Define an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (or factor) of two numbers.\n\n2. The `gcd` function works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number, until the remainder becomes zero.\n\n3. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n\n4. It directly returns the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 51 and 31 by calling the `gcd` function with those two specific numbers.\n\nThe function assumes that:\n- The input list has at least 52 elements (since it accesses indices 31 and 51)\n- The numbers at those indices are positive integers\n- If the indices are out of range, it will raise an IndexError", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=285))
