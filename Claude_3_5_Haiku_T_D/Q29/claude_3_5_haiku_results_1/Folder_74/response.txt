Defines an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (factor) of two numbers\n2. Takes a list of positive integers as input\n3. Calls the `gcd` function with the integers at indices 36 and 85\n4. Returns the greatest common factor between those two specific integers\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm, which efficiently finds the greatest common factor by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and taking the remainder until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=196))
