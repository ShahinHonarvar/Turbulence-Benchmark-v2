The function does the following:\n1. Extracts the values at indices 2 and 1 from the input list\n2. Uses a while loop to repeatedly divide and find the remainder\n3. Continues until the remainder becomes 0\n4. Returns the final non-zero value, which is the GCF\n\nThe algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=199))
