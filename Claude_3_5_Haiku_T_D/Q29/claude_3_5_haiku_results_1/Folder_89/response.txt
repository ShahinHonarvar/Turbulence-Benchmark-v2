Defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. Takes a list of positive integers as input\n3. Finds the integers at indices 37 and 30\n4. Calculates and returns their greatest common factor using the inner `gcd` function\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller one until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=205))
