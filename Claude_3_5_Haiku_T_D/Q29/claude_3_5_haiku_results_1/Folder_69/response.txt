Define the main function `gcf_two_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument.\n\n2. Inside the function, define a nested helper function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers.\n\n3. The `gcd` function repeatedly uses the modulo operation to reduce the numbers until the remainder is zero, at which point the GCF is found.\n\n4. The main function returns the GCF of the numbers at indices 894 and 801 using the `gcd` helper function.\n\nThe code uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding the greatest common factor of two numbers. It works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=262))
