The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as an argument\n2. It defines an inner `gcd` function that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common factor of two numbers\n3. It returns the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 166 and 106 from the input list\n4. The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero\n5. When the remainder becomes zero, the last non-zero number is the greatest common factor", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=213))
