It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (or factor) of two numbers.\n2. The main function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n3. It uses the `gcd` function to find the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 48 and 76 in the input list.\n4. The GCF is calculated by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and taking the remainder until the remainder is zero.\n5. The final non-zero number is the greatest common factor, which is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=224))
