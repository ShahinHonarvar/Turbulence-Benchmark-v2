Define the main function `gcf_two_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, define a nested helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n3. The `gcd` function uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the modulo operation until the second number becomes zero, at which point the first number is the GCD.\n\n4. The main function returns the GCD of the numbers at indices 90 and 41 in the input list by calling the `gcd` function with those specific elements.\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 91 elements (to access index 90) and 42 elements (to access index 41), and that these indices contain positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=265))
