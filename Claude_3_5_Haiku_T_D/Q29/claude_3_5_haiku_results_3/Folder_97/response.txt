Define an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The outer function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n3. It calls the `gcd` function with the integers at indices 180 and 312 of the input list.\n4. Returns the greatest common factor of those two numbers.\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm (implemented in the inner `gcd` function) to efficiently calculate the greatest common factor. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=235))
