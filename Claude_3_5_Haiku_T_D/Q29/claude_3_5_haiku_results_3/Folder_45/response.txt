It defines an internal helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor between two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The main function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n3. It calls the `gcd` function with the integers at indices 47 and 97 from the input list.\n4. It returns the greatest common factor of those two numbers.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder becomes zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=226))
