It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n2. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n3. It calls the `gcd` function with the integers at indices 47 and 22 from the input list.\n4. It returns the greatest common factor of those two specific numbers.\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller one and taking the remainder until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=223))
