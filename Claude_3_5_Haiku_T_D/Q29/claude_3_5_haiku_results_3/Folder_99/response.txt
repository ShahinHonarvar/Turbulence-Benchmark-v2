Message(id='msg_01G3eq7MsDmoN7zbDtBkqwfS', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `gcf_two_nums` function:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    return gcd(nums[279], nums[812])\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n1. Defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. Takes a list of positive integers as input\n3. Calls the `gcd` function with the values at indices 279 and 812\n4. Returns the greatest common factor between those two numbers\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero number is the GCD.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=209))
