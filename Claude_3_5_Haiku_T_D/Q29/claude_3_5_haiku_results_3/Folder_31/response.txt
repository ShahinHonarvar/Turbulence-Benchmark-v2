It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as its argument.\n3. It calls the `gcd` function with the integers at indices 87 and 95 of the input list.\n4. It returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of those two numbers.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=229))
