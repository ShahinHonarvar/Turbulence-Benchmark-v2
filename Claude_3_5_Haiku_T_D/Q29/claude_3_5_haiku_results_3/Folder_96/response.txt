Defines an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. Returns the GCD of the numbers at indices 95 and 73 from the input list\n3. Uses a while loop to iteratively calculate the GCD by taking the remainder until the remainder becomes zero\n4. Efficiently handles finding the greatest common factor between two numbers", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=192))
