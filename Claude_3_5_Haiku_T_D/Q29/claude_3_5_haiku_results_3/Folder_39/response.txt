It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (or factor) of two numbers.\n2. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as its argument.\n3. It directly returns the GCF of the numbers at indices 46 and 13 using the inner `gcd` function.\n4. The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly taking the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=201))
