It includes a nested helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. It takes a list of positive integers as input.\n3. It retrieves the integers at indices 66 and 90 from the input list.\n4. It calls the `gcd` function with those two integers.\n5. It returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of those two numbers.\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently calculate the GCF, which repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number and takes the remainder until the remainder becomes zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=224))
