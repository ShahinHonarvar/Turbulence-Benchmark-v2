Defines an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (factor) of two numbers\n2. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of numbers as input\n3. It directly accesses the numbers at indices 54 and 13 from the input list\n4. Calls the `gcd` function with those two numbers\n5. Returns the greatest common factor of the two specified numbers\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common factor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=225))
