Define an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCF) of two numbers.\n2. The main function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as an argument.\n3. It calls the `gcd` function with the integers at indices 90 and 54 from the input list.\n4. The function returns the greatest common factor of those two numbers.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=257))
