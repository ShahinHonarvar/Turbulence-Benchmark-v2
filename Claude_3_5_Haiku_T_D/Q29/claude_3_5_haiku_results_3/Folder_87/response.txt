The function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input\n2. It uses a nested helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm\n3. It specifically returns the GCD of the integers located at indices 83 and 14 in the input list\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=203))
