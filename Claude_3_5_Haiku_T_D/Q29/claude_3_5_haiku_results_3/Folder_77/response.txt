Define an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (which is the same as the greatest common factor) of two numbers.\n\n2. The `gcd` function works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number, until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. In the main `gcf_two_nums` function, we call the `gcd` function with the numbers at indices 841 and 804 from the input list.\n\n4. The function returns the GCF of those two numbers.\n\nThe implementation assumes that the input list has at least 842 elements (since it uses indices 841 and 804) and contains only positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=275))
