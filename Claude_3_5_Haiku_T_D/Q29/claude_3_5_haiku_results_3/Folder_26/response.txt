It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. It retrieves the numbers at indices 49 and 31 from the input list\n3. It calls the `gcd` function with those two numbers\n4. It returns the greatest common factor between the two selected numbers\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently compute the GCF by repeatedly taking the modulo until the remainder is zero, at which point the last non-zero value is the greatest common factor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=203))
