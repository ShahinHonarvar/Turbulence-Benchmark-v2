It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n3. It directly calls the `gcd` function with the elements at indices 28 and 49 of the input list.\n4. It returns the GCD of these two numbers, which is also their greatest common factor.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero number is the GCD.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=231))
