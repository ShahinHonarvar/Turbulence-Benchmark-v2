It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (factor) of two numbers\n2. The function takes the list of positive integers `nums` as input\n3. It returns the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 84 and 63 using the `gcd` helper function\n4. The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division until the remainder becomes zero\n5. When the remainder becomes zero, the last non-zero number is the greatest common factor", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=208))
