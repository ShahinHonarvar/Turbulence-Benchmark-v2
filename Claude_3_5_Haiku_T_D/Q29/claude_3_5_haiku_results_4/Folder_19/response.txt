Define an inner function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n   - It repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0.\n   - When `b` is 0, `a` contains the greatest common divisor.\n\n2. The main function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of numbers as input.\n\n3. It calls the `gcd` function with the elements at indices 66 and 90 of the input list.\n\n4. It returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of those two numbers.\n\nThe function assumes the input list has at least 91 elements (indices 0-90) and contains only positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=266))
