Defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (factor) using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. Takes a list of positive integers as input\n3. Passes the integers at indices 28 and 53 to the `gcd` function\n4. Returns the greatest common factor of those two specific numbers\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently calculate the greatest common factor (GCF) by repeatedly dividing and taking the remainder until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=196))
