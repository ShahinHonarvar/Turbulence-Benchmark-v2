It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (or factor) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as an argument.\n3. It calls the `gcd` function with the integers at indices 96 and 57 from the input list.\n4. It returns the greatest common factor of those two integers.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. At that point, the last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=239))
