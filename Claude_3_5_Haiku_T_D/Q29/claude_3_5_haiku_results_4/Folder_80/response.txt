It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The function takes a list of positive integers as an argument.\n3. It returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numbers at indices 95 and 85 by calling the `gcd` function with those specific list elements.\n4. The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=211))
