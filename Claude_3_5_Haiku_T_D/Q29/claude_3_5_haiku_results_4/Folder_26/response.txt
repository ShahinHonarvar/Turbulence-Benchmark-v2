Defines an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common factor (or greatest common divisor) of two numbers\n2. The main function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of numbers as input\n3. It directly calls `gcd` with the numbers at indices 49 and 31 from the input list\n4. Returns the greatest common factor of those two specific numbers\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number, until the remainder is zero. At that point, the last non-zero remainder is the greatest common factor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=225))
