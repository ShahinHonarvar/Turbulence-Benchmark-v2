Defines an inner helper function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (or factor) of two numbers\n2. Takes a list of positive integers as input\n3. Retrieves the integers at indices 279 and 812 from the input list\n4. Calls the `gcd` function with those two integers\n5. Returns the greatest common factor of those two numbers\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm, which efficiently finds the greatest common factor by repeatedly taking the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=219))
