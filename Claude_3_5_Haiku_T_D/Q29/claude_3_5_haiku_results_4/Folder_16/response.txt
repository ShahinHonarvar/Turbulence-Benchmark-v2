It defines an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n2. The function takes a list `nums` as input.\n3. It calls the `gcd` function with the values at indices 860 and 307 of the input list.\n4. The GCD of these two numbers is returned as the result.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=226))
