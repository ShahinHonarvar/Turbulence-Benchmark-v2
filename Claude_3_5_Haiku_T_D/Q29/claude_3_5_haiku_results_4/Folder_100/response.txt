It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n2. The `gcd` function takes two arguments and repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number, replacing the larger number with the remainder until the remainder is zero.\n3. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n4. It returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of the integers at indices 96 and 32 by calling the `gcd` function with those specific list elements.\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding the GCF of two numbers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=239))
