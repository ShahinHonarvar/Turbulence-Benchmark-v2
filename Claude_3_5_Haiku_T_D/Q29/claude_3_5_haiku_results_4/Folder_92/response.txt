Defines an inner function `gcd` that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers\n2. Takes a list of positive integers as input\n3. Applies the `gcd` function to the first two elements of the input list (at indices 0 and 1)\n4. Returns the greatest common factor of those two numbers\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number and takes the remainder until the remainder is zero, at which point the last non-zero remainder is the greatest common factor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=218))
