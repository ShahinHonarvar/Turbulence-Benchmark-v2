Message(id='msg_019QhMb7hcd1GZpMJcnQ6Xun', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 11:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[11:76]\n    repeat_chars = set()\n    seen_chars = set()\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        if char in seen_chars:\n            repeat_chars.add(char)\n        seen_chars.add(char)\n    \n    result = ''\n    for char in s:\n        if char not in repeat_chars:\n            result += char\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. If the input string is 11 characters or shorter, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 11 and 76 (exclusive).\n\n3. It identifies characters that appear more than once in this substring by using two sets:\n   - `repeat_chars` to store characters that are repeated\n   - `seen_chars` to track characters already encountered\n\n4. It builds a new string `result` by including only those characters from the original string that are not in the `repeat_chars` set.\n\n5. It returns the modified string, preserving the original order of characters.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only considering the substring between indices 10 and 76 (exclusive) for finding repeated characters\n- Removing all occurrences of repeated characters from the entire input string\n- Maintaining the original order of characters in the result", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=356))
