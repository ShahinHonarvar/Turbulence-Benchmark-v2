Message(id='msg_014iH2foZ5Pa62ybH1FcLU4m', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 91:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[91:200]\n    char_counts = {}\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    repeated_chars = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in repeated_chars or s.index(char) < 91 or s.index(char) >= 200)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. If the input string is 91 characters or shorter, it returns the string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 91 and 200 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in the substring.\n\n5. It creates a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that are not in the repeated set\n   - Keeping first occurrences of repeated characters before index 91\n   - Keeping first occurrences of repeated characters at or after index 200\n\n6. It returns the new string, maintaining the original order of characters.\n\nThe function handles various edge cases and follows the specified requirements precisely.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=340))
