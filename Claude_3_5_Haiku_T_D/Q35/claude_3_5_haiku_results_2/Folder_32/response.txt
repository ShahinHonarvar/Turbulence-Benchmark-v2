Message(id='msg_01AE8Q752iZ38QnSoAQXmV4f', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 91:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[87:90]\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        if substring.count(char) > 1:\n            chars_to_remove.add(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the string length is less than or equal to 91. If so, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 87 and 90 (which corresponds to the exclusive range of 86 to 90).\n\n3. It creates a set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that occur more than once in the substring.\n\n4. It iterates through the characters in the substring, and if a character appears more than once, it's added to `chars_to_remove`.\n\n5. Finally, it creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in `chars_to_remove`, while preserving the original order.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only looking at the substring between indices 87 and 90\n- Identifying characters that occur more than once in this substring\n- Removing all occurrences of those characters from the entire original string\n- Maintaining the original order of the remaining characters", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=357))
