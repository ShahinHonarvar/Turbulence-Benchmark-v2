Message(id='msg_01D9XqgdfdHuGpwp86zs1Qbr', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 87:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[82:86]\n    repeat_chars = set()\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        if substring.count(char) > 1 and char not in repeat_chars:\n            repeat_chars.add(char)\n    \n    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in repeat_chars)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the specified requirements:\n\n1. It first checks if the string is long enough to perform the operation (at least 87 characters long).\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 82 and 86 (exclusive of 81 and 86).\n\n3. It identifies characters that appear more than once in this substring.\n\n4. It creates a new string by removing all occurrences of these repeated characters from the original string, while maintaining the original order of characters.\n\n5. The function returns the modified string.\n\nThe function handles the following cases:\n- If the string is too short (less than 87 characters), it returns the original string unchanged.\n- It only considers characters repeated in the specific substring.\n- It removes all occurrences of repeated characters from the entire string.\n- It preserves the order of remaining characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=318))
