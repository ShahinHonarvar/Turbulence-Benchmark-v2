Extracts the substring between indices 87 and 89 (which corresponds to the indices 86 and 89, both exclusive)\n2. Creates a set of characters that appear more than once in that substring\n3. Builds a new string by including only those characters from the original string that are not in the set of characters to remove\n4. Returns the modified string, preserving the original order of characters", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=219))
