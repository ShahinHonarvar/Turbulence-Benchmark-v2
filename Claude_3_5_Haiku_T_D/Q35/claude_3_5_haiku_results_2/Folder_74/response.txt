If the input string is shorter than 70 characters, it returns the original string.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 70 and 97 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in this substring.\n\n5. It creates a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that are not in the repeated characters list\n   - Or keeping characters that are outside the specified index range\n   \n6. It preserves the original order of characters in the string.\n\n7. It returns the modified string.\n\nThe function handles the specified requirements by removing all occurrences of characters that repeat more than once between indices 70 and 97, while maintaining the original string's order and structure.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=377))
