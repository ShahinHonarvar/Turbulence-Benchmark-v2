Message(id='msg_01BdDQCA1RHCby1nZ24GXPMX', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    chars_count = {}\n    for i in range(28, 96):\n        if i < len(s):\n            char = s[i]\n            chars_count[char] = chars_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    repeated_chars = {char for char, count in chars_count.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in repeated_chars)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Create an empty dictionary `chars_count` to track character occurrences.\n\n2. Iterate through the indices between 27 and 96 (exclusive) in the input string.\n\n3. Count the occurrences of each character in that range.\n\n4. Create a set `repeated_chars` with characters that appear more than once.\n\n5. Create a new string by including only the characters that are not in the `repeated_chars` set, preserving the original order.\n\n6. Return the modified string.\n\nThe implementation ensures that:\n- Only characters between indices 28 and 95 are considered for repetition check\n- All occurrences of repeated characters are removed\n- The order of remaining characters is preserved", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=320))
