Message(id='msg_01UwwsyiXZ9f3eBE3ARYUBv8', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    char_count = {}\n    for i in range(48, 77):\n        if 0 <= i < len(s):\n            char = s[i]\n            char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    repeated_chars = set(char for char, count in char_count.items() if count > 1)\n    \n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in repeated_chars)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Create an empty dictionary `char_count` to track the frequency of characters.\n\n2. Iterate through the indices 48 to 76 (exclusive) in the string:\n   - If the index is valid (within the string's length)\n   - Count the occurrences of each character in that range\n\n3. Create a set of characters that appear more than once in the specified range.\n\n4. Use a list comprehension to create a new string:\n   - Keep only characters that are not in the set of repeated characters\n   - Preserve the original order of the string\n\n5. Return the modified string.\n\nThe function handles edge cases like:\n- Strings shorter than 77 characters\n- Strings with no repeated characters in the specified range\n- Preserving the original order of characters", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=333))
