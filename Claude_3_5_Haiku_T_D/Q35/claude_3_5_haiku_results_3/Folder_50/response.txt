If the input string is 14 characters or shorter, it returns the original string.\n\n2. It extracts the segment between indices 14 and 76 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this segment.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in the segment.\n\n5. It creates a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that are not repeats in the specified segment\n   - Removing all occurrences of characters that repeat in the specified segment\n   - Preserving the original order of characters\n\n6. It returns the modified string.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only considering the segment between indices 14 and 76\n- Removing all occurrences of characters that repeat in that segment\n- Maintaining the original order of characters in the string", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=384))
