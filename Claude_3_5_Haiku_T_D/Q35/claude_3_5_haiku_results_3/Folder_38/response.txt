If the input string is 37 characters or less, it returns the string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 36 and 85 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this subset.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in this subset.\n\n5. It constructs a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that do not appear more than once in the subset\n   - Keeping the first occurrences of repeated characters before index 37\n   - Keeping the first occurrences of repeated characters after index 85\n   - Removing all occurrences of repeated characters within the subset\n\n6. It returns the modified string.\n\nThe function preserves the order of characters in the original string while removing repeated characters from the specified subset.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=366))
