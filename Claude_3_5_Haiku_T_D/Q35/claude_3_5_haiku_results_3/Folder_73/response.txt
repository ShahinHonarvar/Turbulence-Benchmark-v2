Message(id='msg_01UBVS3Sg6aq9Fp5KwKhmp6H', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 11:\n        return s\n\n    substring = s[11:76]\n    char_counts = {}\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    repeated_chars = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char not in repeated_chars or s.index(char) >= 11 and s.index(char) < 76:\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. If the string is 11 characters or shorter, return the original string unchanged.\n\n2. Extract the substring between indices 11 and 76 (exclusive).\n\n3. Count the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. Identify characters that appear more than once in this substring.\n\n5. Build a new string by:\n   - Including all characters that are not in the repeated characters set\n   - Removing characters that are in the repeated set and appear between indices 11 and 76\n\n6. Return the modified string.\n\nThe function preserves the order of characters in the original string while removing repeated characters from the specified range.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=342))
