If the input string is 201 characters or shorter, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 100 and 200 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in this substring.\n\n5. It builds a new string by:\n   - Skipping the first occurrence of characters that are repeated in the substring\n   - Including all other characters in their original order\n\n6. It returns the modified string.\n\nThe function ensures that for each character repeated in the specified substring, only its first occurrence is kept, while maintaining the original order of the characters in the string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=363))
