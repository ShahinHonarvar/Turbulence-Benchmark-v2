Message(id='msg_01Wd5vWtopXkWY74cZyYeY6x', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 58:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[58:85]\n    char_counts = {}\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    chars_to_remove = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the string is too short to have the specified substring. If so, it returns the original string.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 57 and 85 (exclusive).\n\n3. It creates a dictionary `char_counts` to count the occurrences of each character in the substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in the substring and stores them in `chars_to_remove`.\n\n5. It creates a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in `chars_to_remove`, thus preserving the original order of characters.\n\n6. Finally, it returns the modified string.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only looking at characters between indices 57 and 85\n- Removing all occurrences of characters that appear more than once in that substring\n- Preserving the order of characters in the original string", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=366))
