If the input string is shorter than 63 characters, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. Extract the substring between indices 62 and 96 (exclusive).\n\n3. Count the occurrences of each character in the substring.\n\n4. Identify characters that appear more than once in the substring.\n\n5. Create a new list `result` by iterating through the original string:\n   - If a character is not in the repeated characters set, or if its first occurrence is beyond index 96, it is added to the result.\n\n6. Join the result list into a string and return it.\n\nThe function preserves the order of characters and removes all occurrences of repeated characters from the specified substring.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=348))
