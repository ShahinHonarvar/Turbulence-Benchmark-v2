First, it checks if the input string is long enough to have a substring at indices 81-86.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 82 and 86 (exclusive).\n\n3. It creates a dictionary `char_counts` to count the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in this substring.\n\n5. It creates a new string by including only those characters from the original string that are not in the list of repeated characters.\n\n6. It returns the resulting string, maintaining the original order of characters.\n\nThe function handles the specific requirements of removing all occurrences of characters that repeat more than once in the specified substring, while preserving the order of other characters in the original string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=321))
