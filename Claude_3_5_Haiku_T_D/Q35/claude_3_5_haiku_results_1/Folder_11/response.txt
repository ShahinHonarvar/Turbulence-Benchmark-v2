Message(id='msg_0156m3ZdLQx8FyNbdhe8nFJa', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(49, 76):\n        if s[i] != s[i-1] and s.count(s[i], 49, 76) > 1:\n            chars_to_remove.add(s[i])\n    \n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. Create an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that appear multiple times in the specified range.\n\n2. Iterate through the string from index 49 to 75 (exclusive):\n   - Check if the current character is different from the previous one\n   - Count the occurrences of the current character within the range 49-76\n   - If the count is greater than 1, add the character to `chars_to_remove`\n\n3. Create a new string by joining only the characters that are not in `chars_to_remove`, preserving the original order.\n\n4. Return the modified string.\n\nThe function follows the requirements by:\n- Looking at characters between indices 48 and 76 (exclusive)\n- Identifying characters that occur more than once in that range\n- Removing all occurrences of those characters from the entire string\n- Maintaining the original order of characters", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=339))
