If the input string is shorter than 462 characters, it returns the original string.\n\n2. It extracts the segment of the string between indices 463 and 995 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this segment.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in this segment.\n\n5. It constructs a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that either:\n     a) Do not appear more than once in the segment, or\n     b) First appear after index 995\n\n6. Returns the new string with repeated characters removed.\n\nThe function preserves the original order of characters and only removes repeated characters found specifically in the designated segment.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=322))
