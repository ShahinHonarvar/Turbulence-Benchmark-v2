First, it checks if the string is too short to perform the operation (less than or equal to 11 characters). If so, it returns the original string.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 11 and 76 (exclusive).\n\n3. It creates a set `repeat_chars` to store characters that appear more than once in the substring.\n\n4. It iterates through the substring and adds characters that appear more than once to `repeat_chars`.\n\n5. It creates a new list `result` by iterating through the original string and only keeping characters that are not in `repeat_chars`.\n\n6. Finally, it joins the `result` list and returns the modified string.\n\nThe function preserves the original order of characters while removing all occurrences of repeated characters found in the specified substring range.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=332))
