If the input string is 37 characters or shorter, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 21 and 36 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in this substring.\n\n5. It creates a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that do not appear multiple times in the specified substring\n   - Removing all occurrences of characters that appear multiple times in the specified substring\n   - Preserving the original order of characters in the string\n   - Keeping occurrences of repeat characters that are outside the specified index range\n\nThe function handles various edge cases and ensures that only characters occurring multiple times specifically between indices 21 and 36 are removed from their occurrences throughout the entire string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=369))
