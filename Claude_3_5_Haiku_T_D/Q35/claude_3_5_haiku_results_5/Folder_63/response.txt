Message(id='msg_01G2gXgwYXoYY3U3vrdEPdHe', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 87:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[82:86]\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        if substring.count(char) > 1:\n            chars_to_remove.add(char)\n    \n    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the input string `s` has less than or equal to 87 characters. If so, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 82 and 86 (exclusive of the first and last indices).\n\n3. It creates a set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that occur more than once in the substring.\n\n4. It iterates through the substring, checking the count of each character. If a character appears more than once, it is added to `chars_to_remove`.\n\n5. It constructs a new string by joining all characters from the original string that are not in `chars_to_remove`, thus preserving the order of characters.\n\n6. Finally, it returns the altered string.\n\nThe function will remove all occurrences of characters that are repeated more than once in the substring between indices 82 and 86, while maintaining the original order of characters in the string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=351))
