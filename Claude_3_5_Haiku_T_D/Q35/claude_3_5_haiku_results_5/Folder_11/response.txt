Message(id='msg_01Nkudnz7G2SY5jyG7ndUSp7', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    substring = s[49:76]\n    char_count = {}\n    for char in substring:\n        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    repeated_chars = {char for char, count in char_count.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in repeated_chars or s.index(char) >= 76 or s.index(char) <= 48)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. Extract the substring between indices 49 and 76 (exclusive of 48 and 76).\n2. Count the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n3. Identify characters that appear more than once in this substring.\n4. Create a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that are not in the repeated_chars set\n   - Keeping repeated characters that are outside the specified index range (before 49 or after 76)\n5. Return the new string, preserving the original order of characters.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only removing characters that repeat in the specified index range\n- Preserving the order of characters in the original string\n- Removing all occurrences of repeated characters within the range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=328))
