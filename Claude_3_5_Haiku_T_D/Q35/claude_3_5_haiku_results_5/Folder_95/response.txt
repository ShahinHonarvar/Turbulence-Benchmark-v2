Message(id='msg_01FWvRFwU97nqai5vYdtW8Vb', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    chars_count = {}\n    for i in range(33, 99):\n        if 0 <= i < len(s):\n            chars_count[s[i]] = chars_count.get(s[i], 0) + 1\n    \n    repeat_chars = set(char for char, count in chars_count.items() if count > 1)\n    \n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char not in repeat_chars:\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. Create an empty dictionary `chars_count` to track the frequency of characters between indices 32 and 99 (exclusive).\n\n2. Iterate through the indices 33 to 98 (inclusive) of the input string:\n   - Count the occurrences of each character in that range.\n\n3. Create a set `repeat_chars` containing characters that appear more than once in the specified range.\n\n4. Create an empty list `result` to build the final string.\n\n5. Iterate through each character in the original string:\n   - Only append characters that are not in the `repeat_chars` set.\n\n6. Join the characters in the `result` list and return the modified string.\n\nThe function preserves the original order of characters while removing all occurrences of characters that are repeated more than once between indices 32 and 99.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=364))
