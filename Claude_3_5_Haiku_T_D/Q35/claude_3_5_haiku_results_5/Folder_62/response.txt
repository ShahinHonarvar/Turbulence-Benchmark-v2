Message(id='msg_01JJ9ppdhpmZzKCFwH23weSc', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 92:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[51:92]\n    char_counts = {}\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    repeated_chars = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in repeated_chars or s.index(char) < 51 or s.index(char) >= 92)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. If the input string is 92 characters or shorter, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 51 and 92 (exclusive).\n\n3. It creates a dictionary `char_counts` to count the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in the substring using a set comprehension.\n\n5. It creates a new string by keeping:\n   - Characters that do not appear multiple times in the substring\n   - Characters that do appear multiple times, but only if their first occurrence is before index 51 or at/after index 92\n\n6. It returns the resulting string, which preserves the original order of characters.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by removing only those repeated characters that occur multiple times in the specified substring range, while keeping the overall string order intact.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=376))
