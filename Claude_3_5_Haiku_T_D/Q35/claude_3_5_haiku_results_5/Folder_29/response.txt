Message(id='msg_01H7Pw7yy5jbRWfhKy6jRbWC', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    char_counts = {}\n    for i in range(71, 98):\n        if 0 <= i < len(s):\n            char = s[i]\n            char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    remove_chars = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in remove_chars)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It creates an empty dictionary `char_counts` to track character frequencies.\n\n2. It iterates through the indices from 71 to 97 (exclusive range between indices 70 and 98) and counts the occurrences of each character within this range.\n\n3. It creates a set `remove_chars` containing characters that appear more than once within the specified range.\n\n4. It returns a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the `remove_chars` set, while preserving the original order of characters.\n\nThe function handles cases where:\n- The string might be shorter than the specified range\n- Only characters appearing multiple times in the specified range are removed\n- The original order of characters is maintained", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=314))
