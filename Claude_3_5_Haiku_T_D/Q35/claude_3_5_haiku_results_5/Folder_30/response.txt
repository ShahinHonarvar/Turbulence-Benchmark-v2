Message(id='msg_019bWUkrJ8BdtaPFsazM7gNt', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    if len(string) <= 25:\n        return string\n\n    substr = string[23:24]\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n\n    for char in substr:\n        if substr.count(char) > 1:\n            chars_to_remove.add(char)\n\n    result = ''.join(char for char in string if char not in chars_to_remove)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. First, it checks if the string is too short to have indices 22-24. If so, it returns the original string.\n\n2. It extracts the substring at index 23 (which is between indices 22 and 24, exclusive).\n\n3. It identifies characters in this substring that appear more than once and adds them to a set.\n\n4. It creates a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the set of characters to remove, thus preserving the original order.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the modified string.\n\nThe function meets the requirements by:\n- Focusing on the substring between indices 22 and 24 (exclusive)\n- Identifying characters that appear more than once in this substring\n- Removing all occurrences of those characters from the entire string\n- Maintaining the original order of characters", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=322))
