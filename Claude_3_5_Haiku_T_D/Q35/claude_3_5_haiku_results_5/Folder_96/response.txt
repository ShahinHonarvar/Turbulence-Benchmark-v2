Message(id='msg_016zy7pSHrFpZ4qptxfvmAB1', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 260:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[61:200]\n    char_counts = {}\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    chars_to_remove = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. If the string length is 260 characters or less, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 61 and 200 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this substring using a dictionary.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in the substring.\n\n5. It creates a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the set of repeated characters, while preserving the original order.\n\n6. It returns the resulting string.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only considering characters between indices 60 and 200 (exclusive)\n- Removing all occurrences of characters that appear more than once in that range\n- Maintaining the original order of characters in the string", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=337))
