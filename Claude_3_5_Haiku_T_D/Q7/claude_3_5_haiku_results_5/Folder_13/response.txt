Message(id='msg_01UrqtUGGGaiqar4UH8aWNxB', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers[25:88] if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses list comprehension to extract elements from the input list from index 25 to index 87 (inclusive).\n2. The list comprehension filters the elements to include only even integers by checking if each number is divisible by 2 with no remainder.\n3. If no even integers are found in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.\n\nThe slicing `numbers[25:88]` ensures that elements are taken from index 25 up to but not including index 88, which effectively covers indices 25 to 87 inclusive.\n\nThe modulo operator `% 2 == 0` checks for even numbers by verifying that the number divided by 2 leaves no remainder.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=124, output_tokens=218))
