Message(id='msg_01941qri1Ak6VNZdLpWTekaV', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[37:77] if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 37 to index 76 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in the slice to see if it's even by using the modulo operator `% 2 == 0`.\n3. If an even number is found, it's included in the resulting list.\n4. If no even numbers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.\n\nThe function takes advantage of Python's list slicing, which includes the start index (37) and excludes the end index (77), effectively creating a range from index 37 to 76.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=124, output_tokens=204))
