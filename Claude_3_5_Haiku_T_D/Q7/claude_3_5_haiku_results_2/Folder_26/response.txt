Message(id='msg_01595twVSV87mHdsjBSBkNSp', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[62:100] if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n1. It uses list slicing `nums[62:100]` to extract the sublist from index 62 to index 99 (inclusive).\n2. It uses a list comprehension to filter only even integers from this sublist.\n3. The condition `num % 2 == 0` checks whether each number is even by verifying that the remainder when divided by 2 is zero.\n4. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.\n\nThe function handles the requirements of:\n- Taking a list of integers as input\n- Selecting integers from index 62 to index 99 (inclusive)\n- Returning only the even integers in this range\n- Returning an empty list if no even integers are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=124, output_tokens=230))
