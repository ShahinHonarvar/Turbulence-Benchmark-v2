Message(id='msg_01Jboc5kBeeUvtjfpAbqmGxd', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation for the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[31:35] if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 31 to index 34 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in the slice to see if it is even by using the modulo operator `%`.\n3. If a number is even (divisible by 2 with no remainder), it is included in the resulting list.\n4. If no even integers are found in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.\n\nThe slice `nums[31:35]` ensures that we capture the elements from index 31 to 34, and the condition `num % 2 == 0` filters out only the even integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=124, output_tokens=212))
