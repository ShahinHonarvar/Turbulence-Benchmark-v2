Message(id='msg_01Q6Uwkj8pF6EDQmnZxq7wPY', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    if len(nums) <= 50:\n        return []\n    \n    subset = nums[22:51]\n    return [num for num in subset if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n1. First, it checks if the input list has fewer than 51 elements. If so, it returns an empty list since the requested range is not possible.\n2. It creates a subset of the input list from index 22 to index 50 (inclusive).\n3. It uses a list comprehension to filter out only the even integers from this subset.\n4. The function returns the list of even integers found in the specified range.\n\nKey points:\n- The slice `nums[22:51]` includes indices 22 through 50.\n- `num % 2 == 0` checks if a number is even by testing if it's divisible by 2 with no remainder.\n- If no even integers are found in the range, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=124, output_tokens=256))
