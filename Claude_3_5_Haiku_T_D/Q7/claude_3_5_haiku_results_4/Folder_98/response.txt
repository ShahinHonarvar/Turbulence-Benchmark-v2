It is named `all_even_ints_inclusive`\n2. Takes a list of integers as an argument\n3. Returns even integers only from index 0 to 6 inclusive\n4. Returns an empty list if no even integers exist in the range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=124, output_tokens=229))
