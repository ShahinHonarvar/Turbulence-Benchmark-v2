Creates a set of characters from the substring between indices 19 and 22 (inclusive) that are between ']' and 't' in the character order.\n2. Uses a list comprehension to create a new string that includes only characters not in the set of characters to be removed.\n3. Preserves the original order of characters in the string.\n4.
