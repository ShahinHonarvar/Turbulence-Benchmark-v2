It creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. It iterates through the first two characters of the input string (or fewer if the string is shorter than 2 characters).\n3. For each character in this range that is between '*' and 's' (inclusive), it adds that character to `chars_to_remove`.\n4. It then creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in `chars_to_remove`, preserving their original order.\n5. Finally, it returns the modified string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=154, output_tokens=253))
