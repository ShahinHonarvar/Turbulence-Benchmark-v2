If the input string's length is less than 10, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n\n3. It iterates through the characters at indices 8 and 9 (inclusive).\n\n4. For each character at these indices, if it is between 'R' and 't' (inclusive), it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n\n5. It creates a new string by joining only those characters from the original string that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, preserving the original order.\n\n6. The resulting string is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=156, output_tokens=286))
