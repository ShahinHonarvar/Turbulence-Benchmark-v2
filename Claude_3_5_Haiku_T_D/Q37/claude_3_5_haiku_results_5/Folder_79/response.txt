Message(id='msg_01N2sN8dd6xn3DzHtJ2VZ9M4', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `filter_chars` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    result = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if 10 <= i <= 52 and '@' <= char <= 'T':\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    filtered = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char not in result:\n            filtered.append(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(filtered)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. First, it identifies the characters to be removed by checking their index and value.\n2. Characters between indices 10 and 52 (inclusive) and between '@' and 'T' (inclusive) are collected in the `result` list.\n3. Then, it creates a new list `filtered` by keeping only the characters that are not in the `result` list.\n4. Finally, it joins the `filtered` list into a string and returns it.\n\nThe function preserves the original order of characters while removing the specified characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=155, output_tokens=246))
