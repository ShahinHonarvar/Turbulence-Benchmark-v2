It creates a set of characters to remove by:\n   - Iterating through the string with enumeration to get indices\n   - Checking if the index is between 35 and 51 (inclusive)\n   - Checking if the character is between 'H' and 's' (inclusive)\n2. It then creates a new string by joining only those characters that are not in the set of characters to remove\n3. The characters are kept in their original order\n4. The function returns the modified string", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=156, output_tokens=217))
