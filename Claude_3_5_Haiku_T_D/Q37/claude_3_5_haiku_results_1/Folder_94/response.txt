Creates an empty list `result` to store characters\n2. Iterates through the input string with enumeration to access both the character and its index\n3. Checks if the index is between 51 and 96 (inclusive) and if the character is between 'X' and 'p' (inclusive)\n4. If a character meets these conditions, it is skipped\n5. All other characters are added to the `result` list\n6. The list of characters is joined back into a string and returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=216))
