It creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. It iterates through the characters at indices 88, 89, and 90 of the input string.\n3. If a character is between 'J' and 'Q' (inclusive), it adds that character to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n4. It then creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, preserving the original order.\n5. Finally, it returns the modified string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=248))
