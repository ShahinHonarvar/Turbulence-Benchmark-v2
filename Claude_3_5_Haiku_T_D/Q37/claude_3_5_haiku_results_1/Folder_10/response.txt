It iterates through the string with both index and character using `enumerate()`.\n2. For characters in the index range 63-84 (inclusive) and between 'E' and '~', it stores those characters in a `result` list.\n3. It then creates a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the `result` list, thus effectively removing those specific characters while maintaining the original string's order.\n4. Finally, it returns the filtered string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=156, output_tokens=223))
