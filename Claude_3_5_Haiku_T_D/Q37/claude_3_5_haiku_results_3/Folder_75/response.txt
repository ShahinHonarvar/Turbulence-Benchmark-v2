Creates a set of characters to remove by iterating through the string with their indices\n2. Checks if the index is between 34 and 67 (inclusive)\n3. Checks if the character is between 'W' and 'x' (inclusive)\n4. Builds a new string by keeping only the characters not in the set of characters to remove\n5. Preserves the original order of the characters in the string\n6. Returns the modified string", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=208))
