Message(id='msg_017Pi6bKuatFjxjzN9pbZ5oD', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `filter_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(61, 71):\n        if i < len(s) and '0' <= s[i] <= '@':\n            chars_to_remove.add(s[i])\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterates through indices 61 to 70 (inclusive).\n3. For each index within the string's length, checks if the character at that index is between '0' and '@'.\n4. If a character meets the condition, it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n5. Creates a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, preserving the original order.\n6. Returns the filtered string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=154, output_tokens=252))
