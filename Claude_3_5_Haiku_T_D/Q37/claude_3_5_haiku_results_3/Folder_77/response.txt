Creates a set of characters to remove by:\n   - Iterating through the string with indices\n   - Checking if the index is between 384 and 411 (inclusive)\n   - Checking if the character is between '/' and '8' (inclusive)\n2. Creates a new string by keeping only characters that are not in the set of characters to remove\n3. Preserves the original order of characters in the string\n4. Returns the modified string", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=154, output_tokens=206))
