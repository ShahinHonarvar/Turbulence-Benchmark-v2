If the string length is less than or equal to 74, it returns the original string.\n2. It creates a set of characters to remove by checking characters at indices 73 and 74.\n3. A character is added to the removal set if it is between 'U' and 'l' (inclusive).\n4. It then creates a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the removal set.\n5. The order of characters is preserved in the returned string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=243))
