Message(id='msg_01PkmLuCcZtNz58hpn39w9Ah', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `filter_chars` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(61, 71):\n        if 0 <= i < len(s):\n            char = s[i]\n            if '0' <= char <= '@':\n                chars_to_remove.add(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store unique characters that need to be removed.\n\n2. It iterates through indices 61 to 70 (inclusive) of the input string:\n   - Checks if the index is valid (within the string's length)\n   - If the character at that index is between '0' and '@' (inclusive)\n   - Adds that character to the `chars_to_remove` set\n\n3. It uses a list comprehension to create a new string:\n   - Keeps only the characters that are not in `chars_to_remove`\n   - Preserves the original order of characters in the string\n\n4. Returns the modified string\n\nThe function handles cases where:\n- The string might be shorter than 70 characters\n- Multiple occurrences of the same character will be removed\n- The original order of characters is maintained", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=154, output_tokens=329))
