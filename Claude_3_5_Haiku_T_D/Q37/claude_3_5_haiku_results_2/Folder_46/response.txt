Create an empty list `result` to store characters that meet the filtering criteria.\n\n2. Iterate through the string with `enumerate()` to get both the index and character:\n   - Check if the index is between 11 and 72 (inclusive)\n   - Check if the character is between 'i' and 'v' (inclusive)\n   - If both conditions are true, append the character to `result`\n\n3. Return a new string by keeping only those characters from the original string that are not in `result`\n\n4. This preserves the original order of characters while removing the specified characters\n\nThe function will:\n- Only consider characters at indices 11-72\n- Remove characters between 'i' and 'v' (inclusive) in that range\n- Keep the original string's order\n- Return the modified string", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=272))
