Create an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n\n2. Iterate through indices from 51 to 96 (inclusive):\n   - Check if the index is within the string's length\n   - Get the character at that index\n   - If the character is between 'X' and 'p' (inclusive), add it to `chars_to_remove`\n\n3. Create a new string by joining only those characters from the original string that are not in `chars_to_remove`, thus preserving the original order.\n\n4. Return the modified string.\n\nThe function handles cases where the input string might be shorter than index 96, and it preserves the original order of characters while removing specified occurrences.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=295))
