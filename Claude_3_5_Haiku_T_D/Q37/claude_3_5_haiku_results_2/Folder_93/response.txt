Extract the substring between indices 38 and 69 (inclusive) from the input string.\n2. Create a set of unique characters in that substring.\n3. Filter the set to include only characters between 'H' and 'e' (inclusive).\n4. Create a new string by keeping only the characters that are not in the filtered set.\n5. Return the modified string while preserving the original order of characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=200))
