Creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterates through the string from index 42 to 97 (inclusive).\n3. Checks if each character is between '*' and 'b' (inclusive).\n4. If a character meets the condition, it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n5. Returns a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, preserving their original order.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=155, output_tokens=235))
