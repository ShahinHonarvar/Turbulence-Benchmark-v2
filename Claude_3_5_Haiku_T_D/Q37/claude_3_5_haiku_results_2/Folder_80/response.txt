Create an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterate through indices 36 to 79 (inclusive).\n3. For each index, check if the index is within the string's length and if the character at that index is between 'a' and 'i' (inclusive).\n4. If a character meets these conditions, add it to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n5. Create a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set.\n6. Return the modified string, preserving the original order of characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=264))
