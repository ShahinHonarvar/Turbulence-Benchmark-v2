Message(id='msg_014FavQi1bHgiQHzDxqcEwzW', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `filter_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(27, 30):\n        if i < len(string) and ';' <= string[i] <= 'b':\n            chars_to_remove.add(string[i])\n    \n    return ''.join(char for char in string if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. It checks characters at indices 27, 28, and 29 (if they exist in the string).\n3. If a character at these indices is between ';' and 'b' (inclusive), it's added to `chars_to_remove`.\n4. It then creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in `chars_to_remove`, preserving the original order.\n5. The modified string is returned.\n\nThe function handles cases where:\n- The string might be shorter than 30 characters\n- Multiple occurrences of a character are all removed\n- The order of characters is maintained\n- Only characters at the specified indices are considered for potential removal", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=156, output_tokens=298))
