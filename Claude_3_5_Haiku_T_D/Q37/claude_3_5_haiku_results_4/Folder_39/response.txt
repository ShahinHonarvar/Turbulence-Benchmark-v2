It iterates through the characters of the input string with their indices.\n2. For each character between indices 52 and 81 (inclusive) that is between 'A' and 'U':\n   - It creates a new string by removing all occurrences of that character from the original string.\n   - It returns this new string.\n3. If no character meets the condition, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\nThe function preserves the order of characters while removing all occurrences of the specified character.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=222))
