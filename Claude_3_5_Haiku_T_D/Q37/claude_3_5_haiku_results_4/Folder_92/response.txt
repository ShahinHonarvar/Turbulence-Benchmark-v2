If the input string is less than 5 characters long, it returns the string unchanged.\n2. It checks the character at index 4 (5th character).\n3. If the character is between '7' and 'o' (inclusive), it removes all occurrences of that character from the string.\n4. If the character is outside the specified range, it returns the string unchanged.\n5. The order of characters is preserved by using the `replace()` method.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=156, output_tokens=216))
