Creates a set of characters to remove by iterating through the string with their indices\n2. Checks if the index is between 71 and 94 (inclusive)\n3. Checks if the character is between 'K' and 'a' (inclusive)\n4. Uses a list comprehension to create a new string that excludes the identified characters\n5. Returns the filtered string while maintaining the original order of characters", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=198))
