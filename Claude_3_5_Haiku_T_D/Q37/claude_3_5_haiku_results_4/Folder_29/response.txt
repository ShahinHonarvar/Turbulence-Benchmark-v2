Message(id='msg_01NJDWCP82JdrW2s8kNyHZZn', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `filter_chars` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    result = ''\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if 12 <= i <= 88 and '&' <= char <= 'v':\n            result += ''.join(c for c in s if c != char)\n            return result\n    return s\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n1. It takes a string `s` as input.\n2. It iterates through the characters of the string with their indices.\n3. If a character is at an index between 12 and 88 (inclusive) and is between '&' and 'v', it creates a new string by removing all occurrences of that character from the original string.\n4. It immediately returns this new string.\n5. If no such character is found, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\nThe function ensures that the first character meeting the specified conditions triggers the removal of its occurrences, and the order of the remaining characters is preserved.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=156, output_tokens=244))
