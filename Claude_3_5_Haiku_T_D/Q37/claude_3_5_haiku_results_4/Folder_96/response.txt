It identifies characters between indices 86 and 92 (inclusive) that are between '!' and 's' in the ASCII table.\n2. It creates a set of these characters to remove.\n3. It reconstructs the string by keeping only characters that are not in the set of characters to remove, thus preserving the original order.\n4.
