It creates a set of characters to remove by:\n   - Slicing the input string from index 61 to 70 (inclusive)\n   - Selecting only characters between '0' and '@' (inclusive)\n2. It creates a new string by:\n   - Iterating through the original string\n   - Keeping only characters that are not in the set of characters to remove\n3. It returns the new filtered string, preserving the original order of characters\n\nThe function meets all the requirements specified in the text description.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=154, output_tokens=210))
