Takes the subset of characters from index 4 to 33 (inclusive) using string slicing\n2. Sorts the subset of characters in ascending order\n3. Returns the 4th character (index 3) in the sorted subset, which represents the 4th smallest ASCII value in that range\n\nThe function assumes:\n- The input string has enough characters to slice from index 4 to 33\n- The characters in the input string are distinct\n- The 4th smallest character is the character at index 3 in the sorted subset", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=186))
