Takes a string `s` as input\n2. Creates a subset of the string using slice notation from index 60 to 88 (inclusive)\n3. Sorts the characters in this subset based on their ASCII values\n4. Returns the 7th character (index 6) from the sorted subset, which represents the 7th smallest ASCII value\n\nThe function assumes that the input string has enough characters to perform these operations and that the slice will return a valid subset of characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=171))
