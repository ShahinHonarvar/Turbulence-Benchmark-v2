Message(id='msg_01TSaBsLVWiesYn6or6H2u8o', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    subset = s[9:23]\n    sorted_chars = sorted(subset)\n    return sorted_chars[3]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Uses string slicing `s[9:23]` to extract characters from index 9 to 22 (inclusive)\n2. Uses `sorted()` to sort these characters by their ASCII values\n3. Returns the 4th character from the sorted list (index 3), which represents the 4th smallest ASCII value\n\nThe function assumes that:\n- The input string has at least 23 characters\n- All characters in the string are distinct\n- There will be at least 4 characters in the slice from indices 9 to 22", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=188))
