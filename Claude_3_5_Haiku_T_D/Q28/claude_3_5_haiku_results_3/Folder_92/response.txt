Takes a string `s` as input\n2. Slices the first 4 characters of the string using `s[:4]`\n3. Sorts those 4 characters based on their ASCII values using `sorted()`\n4. Returns the 4th smallest character (index 3) from the sorted subset\n\nKey points:\n- The function assumes the string has at least 4 characters\n- Sorting is done lexicographically, which means characters are ordered by their ASCII values\n- The 4th smallest ASCII value is retrieved by selecting the character at index 3 after sorting", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=183))
