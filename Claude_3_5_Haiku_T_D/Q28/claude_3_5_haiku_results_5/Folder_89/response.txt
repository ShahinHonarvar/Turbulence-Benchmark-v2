Message(id='msg_01DYX9LQE7xND4ZNLdSHeKmG', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    subset = s[24:72]\n    sorted_subset = sorted(set(subset))\n    return sorted_subset[7]\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n1. Takes the substring of `s` from index 24 to 71 (inclusive)\n2. Converts the substring to a set to remove duplicates\n3. Sorts the set of unique characters\n4. Returns the 8th character (index 7) from the sorted set, which represents the character with the 8th smallest ASCII value\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- It takes a string as input\n- It looks at the characters between indices 24 and 71\n- It removes duplicates\n- It returns the character with the 8th smallest ASCII value from that subset", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=202))
