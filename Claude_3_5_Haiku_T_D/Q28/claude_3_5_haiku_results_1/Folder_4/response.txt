Message(id='msg_019C9giKtCS3GW4PJ8iHadAW', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    subset = s[9:23]\n    sorted_subset = sorted(subset)\n    return sorted_subset[3]\n```\n\nThe function works as follows:\n1. It uses string slicing `s[9:23]` to extract the characters from index 9 to 22 (inclusive)\n2. It sorts these subset characters using `sorted()` which will order them based on their ASCII values\n3. It returns the 4th character (index 3) from the sorted subset, which represents the 4th smallest ASCII value\n\nThis implementation handles the requirements precisely: it takes a string, selects characters in the specified index range, sorts them, and returns the 4th smallest character by ASCII value.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=188))
