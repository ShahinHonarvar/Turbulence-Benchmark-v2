Message(id='msg_01U7vR38kqGpb9ufeno9omWU', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python code for the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    subset = s[62:84]\n    sorted_subset = sorted(subset)\n    return sorted_subset[8]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a string `s` as input\n2. It extracts the subset of characters from index 62 to 83 (both inclusive) using slice notation\n3. It sorts this subset of characters based on their ASCII values\n4. It returns the 9th character in this sorted subset (index 8)\n\nThe function assumes that:\n- The input string has enough characters to support the required slicing\n- The characters in the subset are distinct (though the code will work even if they are not)\n- You want the 9th smallest ASCII value (which corresponds to index 8 in a zero-indexed list)\n\nThe function will return a single character representing the 9th smallest ASCII value in the specified substring.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=225))
