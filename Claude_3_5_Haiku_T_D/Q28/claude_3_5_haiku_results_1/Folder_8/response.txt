It takes a string `s` as input\n2. Extracts a subset of characters from index 60 to 88 (inclusive) using slice notation\n3. Sorts this subset of characters based on their ASCII values\n4. Returns the 7th character (index 6) from this sorted subset\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Selecting characters between indices 60 and 88\n- Sorting these characters by their ASCII values\n- Returning the 7th smallest character in this subset", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=179))
