Message(id='msg_01KSQvtNMHWoGi2H3vVnYXqC', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    filtered_chars = [char for char in s[33:61]]\n    sorted_chars = sorted(filtered_chars)\n    return sorted_chars[17]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to extract characters from the input string `s` between indices 33 and 60 (inclusive).\n2. It sorts these characters by their ASCII values using the `sorted()` function.\n3. It returns the 18th smallest character (index 17, since indexing starts at 0) from the sorted list.\n\nThe function assumes that:\n- The input string `s` has at least 61 characters\n- There are at least 18 distinct characters in the filtered range\n- If there are multiple characters with the same ASCII value, they will be sorted lexicographically", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=210))
