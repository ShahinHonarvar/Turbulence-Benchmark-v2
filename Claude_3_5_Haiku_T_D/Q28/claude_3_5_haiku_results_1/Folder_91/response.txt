It takes a string `s` as input\n2. Slices the first 8 characters of the string using `s[:8]`\n3. Sorts those characters based on their ASCII values using `sorted()`\n4. Returns the 8th smallest (index 7) character from that sorted slice\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Considering only characters from indices 0 to 7\n- Sorting those characters by their ASCII values\n- Selecting and returning the 8th smallest character\n- Assuming the input string has at least 8 distinct characters\n\nFor example:\n- `return_nth_smallest_ascii('abcdefghijklmnop')` would return `'h'`\n- `return_nth_smallest_ascii('zybxcwdvauqtrs')` would return the 8th smallest character from the first 8 characters", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=238))
