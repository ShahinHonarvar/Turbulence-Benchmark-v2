Extract the substring from index 67 to 77 (inclusive) using string slicing\n2. Sort the characters in this substring based on their ASCII values\n3. Return the 7th character (index 6) from the sorted subset, which corresponds to the 7th smallest ASCII value\n\nThe function assumes that:\n- The input string has at least 78 characters\n- There is a 7th smallest character in the subset between indices 67 to 77\n- The characters in the substring are distinct (though this is not strictly enforced by the code)", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=191))
