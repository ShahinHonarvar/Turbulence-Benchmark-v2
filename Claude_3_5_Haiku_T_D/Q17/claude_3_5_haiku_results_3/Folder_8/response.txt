It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the sublist of `nums` from index 36 to 85 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number to see if it is divisible by both -27 and -96 using the modulo operator `%`.\n3. If a number is divisible by both -27 and -96, it is included in the resulting list.\n4. If no numbers in the specified range are divisible by both -27 and -96, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=190))
