It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 68 to index 99 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number to see if it is divisible by both -37 and -26 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by both -37 and -26, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by both -37 and -26 in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Using slice notation `nums[68:100]` to get elements from index 68 to 99\n- Checking divisibility by both -37 and -26\n- Returning a list of qualifying integers from the specified range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=249))
