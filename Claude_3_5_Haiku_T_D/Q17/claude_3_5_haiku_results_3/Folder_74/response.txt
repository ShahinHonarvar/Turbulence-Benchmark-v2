Message(id='msg_017Po3CTtzhmeB8v7hKY6Kjq', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[90:98] if num % 13 == 0 and num % 35 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Takes a list of integers as input\n2. Slices the list from index 90 to 97 (both inclusive) using `nums[90:98]`\n3. Uses a list comprehension to filter numbers that are divisible by both 13 and 35\n4. Returns the list of numbers that meet the conditions\n5. If no numbers in the specified range are divisible by both 13 and 35, an empty list is returned\n\nThe divisibility check is done using the modulo operator `%`, where `num % 13 == 0` checks divisibility by 13 and `num % 35 == 0` checks divisibility by 35.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=234))
