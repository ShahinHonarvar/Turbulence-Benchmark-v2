Message(id='msg_01MhcTb9fepAYeuiHKsXw626', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[10:101] if num % 10 == 0 and num % 100 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 10 to index 100 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number to see if it is divisible by both 10 and 100 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by both 10 and 100, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Starting at index 10\n- Ending at index 100\n- Checking divisibility by both 10 and 100\n- Returning an empty list if no such numbers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=232))
