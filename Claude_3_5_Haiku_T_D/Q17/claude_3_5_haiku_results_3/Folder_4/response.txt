Message(id='msg_01XvHAT7WUuHYqd8HiJ5SDYm', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers[86:91] if num % -71 == 0 and num % -67 == 0]\n```\n\nThe function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to extract elements from the input list from index 86 to 90 (inclusive)\n2. It checks each number in that range to see if it's divisible by both -71 and -67\n3. A number is divisible by both -71 and -67 if the remainder of division by each number is 0\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list will be returned\n5. The slice `numbers[86:91]` ensures that indexes 86 to 90 are checked\n6. The function returns the list of numbers that satisfy the divisibility condition", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=219))
