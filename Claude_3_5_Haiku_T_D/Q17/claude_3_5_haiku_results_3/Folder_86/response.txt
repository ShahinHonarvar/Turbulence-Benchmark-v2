Message(id='msg_01KMLcPiWoVVkS4SX2na89u5', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[54:80] if num % 54 == 0 and num % 28 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 54 to index 79 (80 is exclusive in Python slicing)\n2. It checks each number to see if it is divisible by both 54 and 28 using the modulo operator\n3. If a number is divisible by both 54 and 28, it is included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list will be returned\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only checking numbers from index 54 to 79\n- Checking divisibility by both 54 and 28\n- Returning an empty list if no such numbers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=235))
