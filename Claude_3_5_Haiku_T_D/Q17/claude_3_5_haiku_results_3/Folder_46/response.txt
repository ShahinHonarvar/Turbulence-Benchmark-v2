Message(id='msg_01RBWstD7JhvK8UE283WenFL', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers[11:47] if num % 55 == 0 and num % 36 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list, starting from index 11 up to and including index 46 (effectively index 47 in slice notation)\n2. For each number in that range, it checks if the number is divisible by both 55 and 36 using the modulo operator (%)\n3. If a number is divisible by both 55 and 36, it is included in the resulting list\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function handles all the requirements:\n- It takes a list of integers as input\n- It selects numbers only from index 11 to index 46\n- It filters numbers divisible by both 55 and 36\n- Returns an empty list if no such numbers exist in the specified range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=256))
