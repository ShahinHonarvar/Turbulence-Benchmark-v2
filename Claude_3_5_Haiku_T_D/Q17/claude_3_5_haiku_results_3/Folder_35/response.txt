Message(id='msg_01J5KP1HUndoy47L511Aqv4q', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[77:88] if num % 23 == 0 and num % 57 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to filter the input list\n2. Takes the slice of the list from index 77 to 87 (inclusive) using `nums[77:88]`\n3. Checks each number `num` in that slice to see if it's divisible by both 23 and 57\n4. A number is divisible by both 23 and 57 if the remainder of division by both numbers is 0\n5. Returns a list of numbers meeting these conditions\n6. If no numbers meet the conditions, it returns an empty list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=207))
