Message(id='msg_014dbq6qZp2GkAsfZVYSrEa3', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[30:201] if num % -115 == 0 and num % 115 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 30 to index 200 (inclusive).\n2. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both -115 and 115.\n3. If a number is divisible by both, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function meets the requirements by:\n- Taking a single argument (a list of integers)\n- Slicing the list from index 30 to 200 (both inclusive)\n- Checking divisibility by both -115 and 115\n- Returning a list of numbers that meet these conditions\n- Returning an empty list if no such numbers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=253))
