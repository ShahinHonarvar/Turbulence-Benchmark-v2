It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the sublist of `nums` from index 543 to 584 (inclusive)\n2. It checks if each number in this sublist is divisible by both -553 and -737 using the modulo operator\n3. If a number is divisible by both -553 and -737, it is included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers are divisible by both numbers, an empty list is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=180))
