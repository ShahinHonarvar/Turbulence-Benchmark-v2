It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the sublist of `nums` from index 55 to 66 (inclusive).\n2. For each number in this sublist, it checks if the number is divisible by both 22 and 82 using the modulo operator (`%`).\n3. If a number is divisible by both 22 and 82, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by both 22 and 82 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=201))
