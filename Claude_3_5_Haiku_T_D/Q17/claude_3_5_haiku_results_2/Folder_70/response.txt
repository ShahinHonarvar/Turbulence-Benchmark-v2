Message(id='msg_017YZXVE3MzUfvmpK2pKbcB9', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[42:44] if num % 15 == 0 and num % 87 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to filter the list `nums` from index 42 to 43 (inclusive)\n2. For each number in that range, it checks if the number is divisible by both 15 and 87 using the modulo operator (`%`)\n3. If a number is divisible by both 15 and 87, it is included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets the specifications by:\n- Taking a list of integers as its argument\n- Checking only the elements at indices 42 and 43\n- Filtering for numbers divisible by both 15 and 87\n- Returning the list of such numbers (or an empty list if no such numbers exist)", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=249))
