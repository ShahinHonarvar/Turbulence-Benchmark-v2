It uses a list comprehension to create a list of numbers.\n2. It selects numbers from the input list from index 40 to index 200 (inclusive).\n3. For each number in this range, it checks if the number is divisible by both 21 and 71.\n4. If a number is divisible by both 21 and 71, it is included in the returned list.\n5. If no such numbers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=194))
