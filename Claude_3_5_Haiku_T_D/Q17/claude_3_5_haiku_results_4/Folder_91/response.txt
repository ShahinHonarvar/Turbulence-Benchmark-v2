Message(id='msg_01CShwzAf6MqczChQrCQKh1e', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[:5] if num % 8 == 0 and num % -3 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It only looks at the first 5 elements of the input list (index 0 to 4) using `nums[:5]`\n3. It checks each number `num` to see if it's divisible by both 8 and -3 using the modulo operator `%`\n4. If a number is divisible by both 8 and -3, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function will work with any input list of integers, returning those divisible by both 8 and -3 from the first 5 elements.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=233))
