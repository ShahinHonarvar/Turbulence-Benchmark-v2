It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` from index 20 to index 200 (inclusive).\n2. It checks if each number is divisible by both -20 and -200 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by both -20 and -200, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function will return a list of integers from the input list that are located between index 20 and 200 and are divisible by both -20 and -200.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=215))
