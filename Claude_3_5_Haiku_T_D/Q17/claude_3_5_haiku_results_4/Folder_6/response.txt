It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 41 to 57 (which includes indices 41 to 56)\n3. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both 82 and 90\n4. If a number is divisible by both 82 and 90, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=186))
