Takes a list of integers as input\n2. Uses list comprehension to slice the list from index 35 to 64 (inclusive)\n3. Checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by both -30 and -95\n4. Returns a list of numbers that meet those conditions\n5. If no numbers are divisible by both -30 and -95 in that range, an empty list is returned\n\nKey points:\n- `lst[35:65]` selects the range from index 35 to 64 (65 is exclusive)\n- `num % -30 == 0` checks divisibility by -30\n- `num % -95 == 0` checks divisibility by -95", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=233))
