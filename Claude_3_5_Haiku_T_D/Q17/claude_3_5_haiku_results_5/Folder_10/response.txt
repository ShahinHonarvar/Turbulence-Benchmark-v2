Takes a list of integers as input\n2. Uses list comprehension to slice the input list from index 32 to index 99 (inclusive)\n3. Checks each number in that slice to see if it is divisible by both -11 and -15\n4. Returns a list of all such numbers that meet the divisibility criteria\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function uses the modulo operator `%` to check divisibility. A number is divisible by another number if the remainder of their division is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=198))
