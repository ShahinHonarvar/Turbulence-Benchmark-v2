Message(id='msg_01UetZmRFdsa98VNYg3rFPYf', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[20:36] if num % -36 == 0 and num % -89 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 20 to 35 (inclusive)\n2. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by both -36 and -89\n3. A number is divisible by another number if the remainder of division is 0\n4. If no numbers in the specified range meet the divisibility conditions, an empty list will be returned\n5. The function takes advantage of Python's slice notation to extract the specified range of numbers\n6. The modulo operator `%` is used to check divisibility", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=209))
