It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 50 to 92 (inclusive) using `nums[50:93]`\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by both -94 and -95 using the modulo operator `%`\n4. If a number is divisible by both -94 and -95, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the divisibility criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets all the specified requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as input\n- Checks divisibility by -94 and -95\n- Operates only on the slice from index 50 to 92\n- Returns an empty list if no integers are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=245))
