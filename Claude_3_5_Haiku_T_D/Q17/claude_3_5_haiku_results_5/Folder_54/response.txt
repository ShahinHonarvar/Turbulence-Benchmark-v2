Message(id='msg_01DCc32KZT46KSzvQjerv1iF', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[13:92] if num % -65 == 0 and num % -62 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Takes a list of integers as an input\n2. Uses list slicing to get elements from index 13 to 91 (inclusive)\n3. Uses a list comprehension to filter numbers divisible by both -65 and -62\n4. Returns the list of numbers that meet the criteria\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function first creates a slice of the input list from index 13 to 92 (which represents indices 13 to 91 inclusive), then checks each number to see if it's divisible by both -65 and -62. The modulo operator `%` is used to check divisibility.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=226))
