Message(id='msg_01CBqw6RiYwsj9xhZEbaVEri', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[58:82] if num % 55 == 0 and num % 10 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a list of integers as input\n2. Uses a list comprehension to slice the list from index 58 to 81 (inclusive)\n3. Checks each number in the slice to see if it's divisible by both 55 and 10\n4. Returns a list of all numbers that meet those conditions\n5. If no numbers meet the conditions, it will return an empty list\n\nThe key elements are:\n- `nums[58:82]` selects the range of indices from 58 to 81 (note that in slice notation, the end index is exclusive, so 82 is used to include index 81)\n- `num % 55 == 0` checks divisibility by 55\n- `num % 10 == 0` checks divisibility by 10", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=258))
