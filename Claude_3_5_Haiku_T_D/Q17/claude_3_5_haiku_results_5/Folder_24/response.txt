Message(id='msg_011nE93NcWXnoqdCbMR7Lmhy', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[29:54] if num != 0 and num % -68 == 0 and num % -85 == 0]\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n1. It takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. Uses a list comprehension to filter the list\n3. Slices the list from index 29 to 54 (which includes indices 29 to 53)\n4. Checks three conditions:\n   - The number is not zero (to avoid division by zero)\n   - The number is divisible by -68 (remainder is zero)\n   - The number is divisible by -85 (remainder is zero)\n5. Returns a list of all numbers that meet these conditions\n\nIf no such numbers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=230))
