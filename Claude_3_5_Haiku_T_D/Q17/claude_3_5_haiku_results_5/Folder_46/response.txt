Message(id='msg_01JhcwKBJGHVoTiVjFiKCBUp', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[11:47] if num % 55 == 0 and num % 36 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` from index 11 to 46 (inclusive).\n2. For each number in this range, it checks if the number is divisible by both 55 and 36 using the modulo operator `%`.\n3. If a number is divisible by both 55 and 36, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list will be returned.\n\nThe slicing `nums[11:47]` ensures that elements from index 11 to 46 are considered, which matches the specification of "from index 11 to index 46, both inclusive".', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=232))
