It takes a list of integers as input (`nums`)\n2. Creates an empty list `result` to store the integers that meet the criteria\n3. Iterates through the indices from 299 to 382 (inclusive)\n4. For each index, it checks three conditions:\n   - The index is within the list's bounds\n   - The number at that index is divisible by 858\n   - The number at that index is divisible by 952\n5. If all conditions are met, the number is appended to the `result` list\n6. Returns the `result` list, which will be empty if no such integers are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=253))
