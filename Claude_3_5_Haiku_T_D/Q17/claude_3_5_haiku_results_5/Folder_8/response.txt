It takes a list of integers `nums` as an argument.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to:\n   - Slice the input list from index 36 to 85 (inclusive)\n   - Check each number in the sliced range to see if it's divisible by both -27 and -96\n   - If a number is divisible by both, it is included in the resulting list\n3. If no numbers meet the divisibility criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function checks divisibility by using the modulo operator `%`. A number is divisible by another number if the remainder of their division is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=219))
