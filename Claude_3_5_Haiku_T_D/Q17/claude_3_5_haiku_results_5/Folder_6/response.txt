It takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. It uses a list comprehension to slice the list from index 41 to 57 (which includes indices 41 to 56)\n3. For each number in the sliced list, it checks if the number is divisible by both 82 and 90\n4. If a number is divisible by both 82 and 90, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=189))
