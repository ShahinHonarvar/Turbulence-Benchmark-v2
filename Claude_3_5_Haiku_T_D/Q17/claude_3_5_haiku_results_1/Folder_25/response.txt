Message(id='msg_01KHjMr4vFBqBFVj1iCYSXNi', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[25:81] if num % -20 == 0 and num % -26 == 0]\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n1. Takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. Uses a list comprehension to slice the list from index 25 to index 80 (inclusive)\n3. Checks each number in the sliced range to see if it's divisible by both -20 and -26\n4. Returns a list of all numbers that meet the divisibility criteria\n5. If no numbers are divisible by both -20 and -26 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function uses the modulo operator `%` to check divisibility. If a number is divisible by both -20 and -26, the remainder of division by both numbers will be zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=231))
