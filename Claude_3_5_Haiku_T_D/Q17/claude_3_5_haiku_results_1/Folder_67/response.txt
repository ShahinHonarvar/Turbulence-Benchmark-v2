Message(id='msg_012oFS7VFqXtRAYoa3LTTjn3', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[24:33] if num % 35 == 0 and num % 87 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. Uses a list comprehension to filter the slice of the list from index 24 to 32 (inclusive)\n3. Checks each number in that slice to see if it\'s divisible by both 35 and 87\n4. Returns a list of all numbers that meet this condition\n5. If no numbers are divisible by both 35 and 87 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe list slicing `nums[24:33]` captures the range from index 24 to index 32, which matches the specification of "from index 24 to index 32, both inclusive".\n\nThe divisibility check `num % 35 == 0 and num % 87 == 0` ensures that only numbers divisible by both 35 and 87 are included in the result.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=279))
