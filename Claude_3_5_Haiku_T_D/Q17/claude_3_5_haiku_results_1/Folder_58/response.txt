Message(id='msg_01LsdFvxr2SFNvMHkYCzd2wm', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    lcm = 546 * 709 // math.gcd(546, 709)\n    return [num for num in nums[240:902] if num % lcm == 0]\n```\n\nNote: The implementation assumes the import of the `math` module for the `gcd` function. The function does the following:\n\n1. Calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of 546 and 709 by multiplying them and dividing by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n2. Uses a list comprehension to filter numbers from the input list between indices 240 and 901 (inclusive).\n3. Checks each number for divisibility by the LCM.\n4. Returns a list of numbers that are divisible by both 546 and 709.\n\nIf no such numbers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=236))
