Message(id='msg_01BByfxbNm4v458mWk81Q214', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[55:85] if num % -24 == 0 and num % -11 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 55 to 84 (inclusive).\n2. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both -24 and -11 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by both -24 and -11, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are found in the specified range that are divisible by both -24 and -11, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- It takes a list of integers as an argument\n- It checks the slice of the list from index 55 to 84\n- It returns a list of integers divisible by both -24 and -11 in that range\n- If no such integers exist, it returns an empty list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=272))
