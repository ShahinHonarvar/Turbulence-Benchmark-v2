Message(id='msg_01Ugx4B8nmcSbfZJ2VKcc3aj', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[31:51] if num % 81 == 0 and num % 64 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 31 to 50 (inclusive).\n2. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both 81 and 64 using the modulo operator (%).\n3. If a number is divisible by both 81 and 64, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers meet the divisibility criteria, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function meets the requirements by:\n- Taking a list of integers as an argument\n- Checking the range from index 31 to 50\n- Returning only numbers divisible by both 81 and 64\n- Returning an empty list if no such numbers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=249))
