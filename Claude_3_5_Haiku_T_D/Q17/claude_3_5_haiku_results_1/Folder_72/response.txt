It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 38 to 81 (inclusive).\n2. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both -61 and -71.\n3. If a number is divisible by both -61 and -71, it is included in the resulting list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by both -61 and -71 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=190))
