Message(id='msg_018C9s55qdDtAsvGKz9zyy2g', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[40:201] if num % 21 == 0 and num % 71 == 0]\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 40 to index 200 (inclusive).\n2. For each number in this slice, it checks two conditions:\n   - The number is divisible by 21 (using the modulo operator `%`)\n   - The number is divisible by 71 (using the modulo operator `%`)\n3. If both conditions are true, the number is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers meet these conditions, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function will return a list of all integers in the specified range that are divisible by both 21 and 71.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=227))
