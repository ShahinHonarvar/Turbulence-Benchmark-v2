Message(id='msg_01UEnhRGPivxvQCi1Af1vGWo', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[90:201] if num % -31 == 0 and num % 13 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a single argument `nums`, which is a list of integers.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the list from index 90 to index 200 (inclusive).\n3. For each number in this slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both -31 and 13 using the modulo operator `%`.\n4. If a number is divisible by both -31 and 13, it is included in the resulting list.\n5. If no numbers meet the divisibility criteria, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=208))
