It uses a list comprehension to filter the input list between indices 56 and 88 (both inclusive).\n2. It checks each number to see if it's divisible by both -59 and -79 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by both -59 and -79, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list will be returned.\n5. The slicing `nums[56:89]` ensures we only look at elements from index 56 to 88.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=206))
