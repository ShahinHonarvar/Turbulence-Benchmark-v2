It takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. It uses a list comprehension to select elements from index 69 to 70 (inclusive)\n3. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both 72 and 70 using the modulo operator `%`\n4. If a number is divisible by both 72 and 70, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=194))
