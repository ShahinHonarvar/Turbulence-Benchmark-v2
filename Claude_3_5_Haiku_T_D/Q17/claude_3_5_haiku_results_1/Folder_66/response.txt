Message(id='msg_015iWLLQmxFPDGhQnvzo2r2J', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[58:82] if num % 55 == 0 and num % 10 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a list of integers `nums` as input\n2. It uses a list comprehension to slice the input list from index 58 to 81 (inclusive)\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it is divisible by both 55 and 10\n4. If a number is divisible by both 55 and 10, it is included in the result list\n5. If no numbers meet the divisibility criteria, an empty list is returned\n6. The slicing `nums[58:82]` ensures that index 81 is included in the range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=213))
