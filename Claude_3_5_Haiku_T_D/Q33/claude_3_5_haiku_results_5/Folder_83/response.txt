Define a string `vowels` containing all vowel letters in both uppercase and lowercase.\n2. Use a list comprehension to create a list of characters that meet the following conditions:\n   - The character is within the specified slice of the input string (from index 90 to 97 exclusive)\n   - The character is a vowel\n   - The character is greater than '_' and less than or equal to 'x'\n3. Return the resulting list of vowels that meet these conditions\n4. If no characters meet the conditions, an empty list is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=144, output_tokens=218))
