Defines a list of vowels\n2. Creates an empty result list\n3. Iterates through each character in the input string\n4. Checks if the character meets the following conditions:\n   - Is a vowel (in the vowels list)\n   - Has an ASCII value between 65 (inclusive) and 70 (exclusive)\n   - Is greater than '%'\n   - Is less than or equal to 'G'\n5. If a character meets all conditions, it's added to the result list\n6. Returns the result list with matching characters, or an empty list if no characters match", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=144, output_tokens=259))
