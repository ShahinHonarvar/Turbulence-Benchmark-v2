Define a string `vowels` containing all vowel letters (both lowercase and uppercase)\n2. Create an empty `result` list to store matching vowels\n3. Iterate through the string from index 133 to 305 (exclusive of 306)\n4. Check three conditions for each character:\n   - The index is within the string's length\n   - The character is a vowel\n   - The character is greater than 'c'\n   - The character is less than or equal to 'd'\n5. If all conditions are met, append the character to the result list\n6.
