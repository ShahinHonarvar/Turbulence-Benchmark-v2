Taking exactly 2 distinct arguments\n2. Accepting sets of integers\n3. Returning the smallest set that contains both input sets\n4. Ensuring that both input sets are subsets of the returned set", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=203))
