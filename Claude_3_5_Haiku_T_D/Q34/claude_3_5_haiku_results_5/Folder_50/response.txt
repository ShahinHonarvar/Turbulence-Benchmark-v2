Message(id='msg_01Ce38Bf79bXAPYVj5Xgt1ky', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. The function `find_original_set` uses `*sets` to accept exactly 99 distinct set arguments.\n2. The `set().union(*sets)` method creates a new set that contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n3. Since the input sets are guaranteed to be distinct (as per the specification), this ensures that the returned set is the smallest set that contains all elements from all input sets.\n4. The function will return the original set that satisfies the requirement of containing elements from all input sets.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nset1 = {1, 2, 3}\nset2 = {3, 4, 5}\nset3 = {5, 6, 7}\n# ... 96 more sets\nresult = find_original_set(set1, set2, set3, ...)\n```\n\nThe function will create a single set that contains all unique elements from the input sets, which is the smallest set that includes all input sets as subsets.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=270))
