This ensures that the returned set contains all elements from the input sets, and is therefore the smallest set that contains each of the input sets as a subset.\n\nThe `union()` method efficiently combines the unique elements from multiple sets, automatically eliminating duplicates and creating a new set containing all distinct elements. By using this method, the function guarantees that the result will be the smallest possible set that satisfies the requirement.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=161))
