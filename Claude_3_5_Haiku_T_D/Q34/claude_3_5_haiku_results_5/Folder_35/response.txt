Message(id='msg_01DWWCn12JjZc5LRwyJc93u4', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis concise implementation works as follows:\n\n1. The function uses `*sets` to accept exactly 702 distinct set arguments.\n2. The `set().union(*sets)` method creates a new set that is the union of all input sets.\n3. This ensures that the returned set contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n4. By definition, this will be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\nThe function leverages Python's built-in `set.union()` method, which efficiently merges multiple sets by creating a new set containing all unique elements from the input sets. This approach guarantees that:\n- All elements from the input sets are included\n- The result is a minimal set containing all those elements\n- It works for any number of sets (in this case, exactly 702)", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=221))
