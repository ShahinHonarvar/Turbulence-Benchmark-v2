Message(id='msg_01SWqkjzXWaVkC7uLEaqbFBv', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses `*sets` to accept exactly 194 distinct set arguments\n2. The `.union()` method is called on an empty set with all the input sets as arguments\n3. This efficiently combines all the sets into a single set that contains all unique elements from the input sets\n4. By using `.union()`, it creates the smallest possible set that contains all elements from the input sets\n\nThe function will work as specified:\n- It accepts 194 distinct sets as arguments\n- It returns a single set that is the union of all input sets\n- Each input set will be a subset of the returned set\n- The returned set will contain the smallest possible number of unique elements", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=196))
