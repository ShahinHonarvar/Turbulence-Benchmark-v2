Message(id='msg_01QidgNfjDsdq2vhJSxLhdCZ', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 993:\n        raise ValueError("Function must be called with exactly 993 sets")\n    \n    original_set = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        original_set.update(s)\n    \n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It uses `*sets` to accept exactly 993 sets as arguments.\n\n2. It first checks if the number of input sets is exactly 993. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It creates an empty set called `original_set`.\n\n4. It iterates through all the input sets and uses the `update()` method to add all elements from each set to `original_set`.\n\n5. The resulting `original_set` will contain all unique elements from all input sets, which is the smallest set that contains all the input sets as subsets.\n\n6. It returns this `original_set`.\n\nThe function works by simply taking the union of all input sets, which guarantees that:\n- The result contains all elements from all input sets\n- The result is the smallest such set (since it only contains the unique elements needed)\n- Each input set is a subset of the returned set\n\nThe function will work correctly as long as exactly 993 sets are provided as arguments.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=325))
