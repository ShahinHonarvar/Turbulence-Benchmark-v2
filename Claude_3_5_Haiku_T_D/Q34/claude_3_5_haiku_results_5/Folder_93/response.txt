The function `find_original_set` uses `*sets` to accept exactly 90 distinct sets of integers as arguments.\n\n2. An empty set `original_set` is created initially.\n\n3. The function iterates through each set in the input sets using a `for` loop.\n\n4. For each set, `update()` is called on `original_set`, which adds all elements from the current set to `original_set`.\n\n5. Since each set is added to `original_set`, the resulting set will be the smallest set that contains all elements from all input sets.\n\n6. The function returns `original_set`, which is guaranteed to be a superset of all input sets.\n\nThe function works efficiently by using Python's built-in set operations to merge the sets, ensuring that the returned set is minimal and contains all elements from the input sets.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=253))
