Message(id='msg_011v7gJc7swV4Bb9XoFMVSkd', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 42:\n        raise ValueError("Function must be called with exactly 42 sets")\n    \n    original_set = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        original_set.update(s)\n    \n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It uses `*sets` to accept exactly 42 sets as arguments.\n\n2. It first checks if exactly 42 sets were provided. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It creates an empty set called `original_set`.\n\n4. It iterates through each of the input sets and uses the `update()` method to add all elements from each set to `original_set`.\n\n5. The `update()` method ensures that only unique elements are added, which means duplicates are automatically eliminated.\n\n6. It returns `original_set`, which will contain all unique elements from all input sets.\n\nThis implementation guarantees that the returned set is the smallest set that contains all elements from the 42 input sets, as it simply collects all unique elements while preserving the set property of unique elements.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=282))
