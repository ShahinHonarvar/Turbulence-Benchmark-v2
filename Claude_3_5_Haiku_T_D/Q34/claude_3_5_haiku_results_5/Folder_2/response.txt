Message(id='msg_01JEjNeXjdkX1Tfi54P3xBhQ', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis concise solution does the following:\n\n1. The function uses `*sets` to accept exactly 685 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n2. The `.union(*sets)` method combines all the input sets into a single set that contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n3. By definition, this resulting set will be the smallest set that contains all elements from each of the input sets.\n\nThe function works as follows:\n- If all input sets are subsets of the returned set, then the returned set is the minimal set containing all elements from the input sets\n- It preserves the uniqueness of elements due to the properties of Python sets\n- It will work with any number of input sets, but the specification requires exactly 685 sets\n\nWhen called, the function can be used like:\n`original_set = find_original_set(set1, set2, ..., set685)`", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=243))
