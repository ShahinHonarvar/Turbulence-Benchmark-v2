Message(id='msg_01SgsHBxbDzCLitvbbjSdXUU', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 84:\n        raise ValueError("Function must be called with exactly 84 distinct sets")\n    \n    original_set = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        original_set.update(s)\n    \n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It uses `*sets` to accept exactly 84 arguments, which will be collected into a tuple.\n\n2. It first checks if exactly 84 sets were provided. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It creates an empty set called `original_set`.\n\n4. It iterates through all the input sets using a `for` loop.\n\n5. For each set, it uses the `update()` method to add all elements to `original_set`. Since `update()` only adds unique elements, this effectively creates a union of all input sets.\n\n6. Finally, it returns `original_set`, which will be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Exactly 84 sets are required as input\n- All input sets are preserved as subsets of the returned set\n- The returned set is the smallest such set (a true superset containing all unique elements)', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=314))
