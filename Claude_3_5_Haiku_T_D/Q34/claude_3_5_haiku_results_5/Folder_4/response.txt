Message(id='msg_013XVyu8AVmCT4Qy1hJsrc4H', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 40:\n        raise ValueError("Function requires exactly 40 distinct sets")\n    \n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It uses `*sets` to accept exactly 40 sets as arguments.\n\n2. It first checks if the number of sets passed is exactly 40. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It uses the `set().union(*sets)` method to create a union of all input sets, which will be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\n4. The function returns this union set.\n\nThe implementation ensures that:\n- Exactly 40 sets are passed as arguments\n- All input sets are transformed into a single set\n- The returned set is the smallest possible set containing all elements from the input sets\n- Each input set is a subset of the returned set\n\nThe function will raise a `ValueError` if the number of sets is not 40, and it will combine the elements of the input sets into a single set that serves as the "original set".', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=270))
