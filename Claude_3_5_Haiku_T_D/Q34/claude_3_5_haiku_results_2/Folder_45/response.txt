The function `find_original_set` uses `*sets` to accept exactly 97 sets as arguments.\n\n2. It first checks if exactly 97 sets are provided. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It initializes an empty `original_set`.\n\n4. It iterates through each input set and uses the `update()` method to add all elements from each set to the `original_set`.\n\n5. Since `update()` only adds unique elements and the input sets are sets of integers, the resulting `original_set` will be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\n6. The function returns this `original_set`.\n\nThis solution ensures that:\n- Exactly 97 sets are provided\n- The returned set is the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets\n- Each input set is a subset of the returned set\n\nThe function works by creating a union of all input sets, which naturally becomes the smallest set that contains all elements from the individual sets.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=315))
