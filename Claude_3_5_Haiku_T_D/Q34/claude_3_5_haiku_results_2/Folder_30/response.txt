Message(id='msg_01BNWGK3NBt3vjPeShavRGYM', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a solution to the problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set().union(*args)\n```\n\nThis solution works by doing the following:\n\n1. The function `find_original_set` uses `*args` to accept exactly 78 distinct sets of integers as arguments.\n2. The `set().union(*args)` method call creates a new set that contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n3. Since the input sets are guaranteed to be distinct and 78 in number, the resulting set will be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n4. The function returns this unified set.\n\nThe `.union(*args)` method efficiently combines all the sets passed as arguments, creating a new set with all unique elements from those sets. This ensures that the returned set includes every element from each input set, making it the smallest possible superset of all input sets.\n\nFor example:\n- If the input sets are `{1, 2}`, `{3, 4}`, and `{5, 6}`\n- The function will return `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`\n\nThe code satisfies the requirements of taking exactly 78 sets and returning their smallest common superset.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=286))
