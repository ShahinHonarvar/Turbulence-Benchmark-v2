Message(id='msg_01Bj3uDJ3BPBRNDe1DNXYe1x', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. The function uses `*sets` to accept exactly 537 distinct set arguments as separate parameters.\n\n2. The `.union()` method is called on an empty set, with all input sets passed as arguments using the `*` unpacking operator.\n\n3. This creates a new set that contains all unique integers from all input sets.\n\n4. The resulting set is the smallest set that contains all elements from each of the input sets, effectively making it a superset of all input sets.\n\nFor example:\n- If called with `find_original_set({1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4})`, it would return `{1,2,3,4}`\n- If called with 537 different sets, it would return a set containing all unique integers from those sets\n\nThe function directly returns the minimal set that includes all elements from the input sets, ensuring it is the smallest such set.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=247))
