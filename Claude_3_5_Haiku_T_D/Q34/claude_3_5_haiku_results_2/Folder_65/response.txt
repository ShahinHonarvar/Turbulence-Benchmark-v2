Message(id='msg_01QyPBHAjj994eZHpbmfbnPi', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function that takes 80 distinct sets as arguments and returns the smallest set containing all elements from those sets:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 80:\n        raise ValueError("Function must receive exactly 80 sets")\n    \n    original_set = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        original_set.update(s)\n    \n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It uses `*sets` to allow the function to accept exactly 80 sets as arguments.\n\n2. It first checks if exactly 80 sets are provided. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It creates an empty set called `original_set`.\n\n4. It iterates through each input set and uses the `update()` method to add all elements from each set to `original_set`.\n\n5. After processing all sets, `original_set` will contain all unique elements from the input sets.\n\n6. It returns `original_set`, which is the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Exactly 80 sets are passed as arguments\n- All unique elements from the input sets are included\n- The returned set is the smallest possible set containing all elements\n\nExample usage might look like:\n```python\nset1 = {1, 2, 3}\nset2 = {3, 4, 5}\n# ... 78 more sets\nresult = find_original_set(set1, set2, ...)\n```', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=367))
