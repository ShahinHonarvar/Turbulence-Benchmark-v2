Message(id='msg_0156133yFYQPaurrGB6q52d7', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses `*sets` to accept exactly 9 distinct sets as arguments.\n2. It uses the `set().union()` method with the `*` unpacking operator to combine all the input sets into a single set.\n3. The resulting set will contain all unique elements from all input sets.\n4. This set is the smallest set that contains all elements from each of the input sets, satisfying the requirement of being a superset of each input set.\n\nThe function works because:\n- `set().union()` creates a new set that includes all unique elements from the sets passed as arguments.\n- The resulting set will be the smallest possible set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n- By using set union, we automatically eliminate duplicates and create a minimal superset.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=221))
