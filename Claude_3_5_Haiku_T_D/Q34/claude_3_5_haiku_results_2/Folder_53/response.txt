Message(id='msg_012U1oDiRBhpk5t2JMzE36ZF', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 84:\n        raise ValueError("Function must be called with exactly 84 sets")\n    \n    original_set = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        original_set.update(s)\n    \n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It uses `*sets` to accept exactly 84 sets as arguments.\n\n2. It includes a validation check to ensure exactly 84 sets are provided. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It creates an empty set called `original_set`.\n\n4. It iterates through all the input sets and uses the `update()` method to add all elements from each set to `original_set`.\n\n5. The resulting `original_set` will contain all unique elements from all input sets, effectively creating the smallest set that contains all the input sets as subsets.\n\nThe function guarantees:\n- It works with sets of integers\n- It preserves the uniqueness of elements\n- It returns the smallest set that contains all input sets as subsets\n\nExample usage would look like:\n```python\nresult = find_original_set(\n    {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, ..., # 84 sets in total\n)\n```', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=316))
