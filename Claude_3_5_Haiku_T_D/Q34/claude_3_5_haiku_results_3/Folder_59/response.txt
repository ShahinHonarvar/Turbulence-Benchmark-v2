Message(id='msg_01YURHZZShTcWbwGk6xvGpp7', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 10:\n        raise ValueError("Exactly 10 sets must be provided")\n    \n    original_set = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        original_set.update(s)\n    \n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses *sets to accept exactly 10 sets as arguments\n2. It first checks that exactly 10 sets were provided, raising a ValueError if not\n3. It creates an empty set called original_set\n4. It uses the update() method to add all elements from each input set to the original_set\n5. Since sets only contain unique elements, this will create a set containing all unique integers from the 10 input sets\n6. The resulting set is the smallest set that contains all elements from each input set, as each input set will be a subset of this set\n\nFor example:\n```python\nresult = find_original_set({1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {5,6}, {6,7}, {7,8}, {8,9}, {9,10}, {10,1})\n# result would be {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n```', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=315))
