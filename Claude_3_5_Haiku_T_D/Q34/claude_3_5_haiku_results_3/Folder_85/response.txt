The function `find_original_set` uses `*sets` to accept exactly 85 sets as arguments.\n\n2. The `.union(*sets)` method called on an empty set will create a new set that contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n\n3. This resulting set will be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\n4. By using `set().union(*sets)`, we create a new set that is the union of all input sets, which is guaranteed to be the smallest set that contains all elements from the original sets.\n\nThe function will return the original set that includes all elements from the 85 input sets, with no duplicates, meeting the specification.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=197))
