Message(id='msg_011H1cYBsgwrjFKi1mqDEuHs', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. The function uses `*sets` to accept exactly 993 distinct sets as arguments.\n\n2. The `set().union(*sets)` method does the following:\n   - Creates an empty set\n   - Uses the `union()` method with argument unpacking (`*sets`)\n   - This merges all the input sets into a single set\n\n3. By using `union()`, the function creates a set that contains all unique elements from all the input sets.\n\n4. This resulting set is guaranteed to be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets, as it eliminates duplicates and includes every element exactly once.\n\nThe function will return the original set that is the union of all the input sets, ensuring that each input set is a subset of the returned set.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=218))
