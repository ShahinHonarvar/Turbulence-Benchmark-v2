Message(id='msg_01KPVeuYpvzhZWpm9DhKpq8s', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 99:\n        raise ValueError("Function must be called with exactly 99 sets")\n    \n    original_set = set()\n    for subset in sets:\n        original_set.update(subset)\n    \n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The function uses `*sets` to accept exactly 99 sets as arguments.\n\n2. It first checks if the number of input sets is exactly 99. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It creates an empty set called `original_set`.\n\n4. It iterates through each subset passed as an argument and uses the `update()` method to add all elements from each subset to `original_set`.\n\n5. The function returns `original_set`, which contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n\nThe returned set is guaranteed to be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets, as it includes each unique element exactly once.\n\nThis implementation ensures that:\n- Exactly 99 sets are passed as arguments\n- All unique elements from the input sets are included in the returned set\n- The returned set is the smallest possible set that is a superset of all input sets', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=304))
