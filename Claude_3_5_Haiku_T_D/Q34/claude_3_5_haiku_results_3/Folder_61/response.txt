The function `find_original_set` takes exactly 4 arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n\n2. It uses the `union()` method, which combines all unique elements from the input sets into a single set.\n\n3. By using `union()`, the function ensures that:\n   - All elements from each input set are included in the result\n   - The result is a set (no duplicate elements)\n   - The resulting set is the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets\n\n4. The implementation directly returns the union of all 4 sets, which satisfies the requirement of being the smallest set containing all input sets as subsets.\n\nThe function handles various scenarios, such as:\n- Sets with different sizes\n- Sets with overlapping or completely different elements\n- Sets with no common elements\n\nFor example:\n- `find_original_set({1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5})` would return `{1,2,3,4,5}`\n- `find_original_set({1}, {2}, {3}, {4})` would return `{1,2,3,4}`", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=320))
