Message(id='msg_01QxryDUxLUwAxQmEFNEbZeY', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(set1, set2):\n    return set1.union(set2)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes two arguments, `set1` and `set2`, which are sets of integers.\n2. It uses the `union()` method to combine both sets, creating a new set that contains all unique elements from both input sets.\n3. The resulting set is the smallest set that includes all elements from both `set1` and `set2`.\n4. The function returns this union set.\n\nThe `union()` method ensures that:\n- All elements from `set1` are included\n- All elements from `set2` are included\n- There are no duplicate elements\n- The resulting set is the smallest possible set that contains all elements from both input sets\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nresult = find_original_set({1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5})  # Returns {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n```", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=254))
