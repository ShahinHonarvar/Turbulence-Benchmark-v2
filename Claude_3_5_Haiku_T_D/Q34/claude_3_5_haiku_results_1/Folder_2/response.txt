Message(id='msg_01GLS25cQjNTq8hyb6c8E9zs', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    original_set = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        original_set.update(s)\n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The function `find_original_set` uses `*sets` to accept exactly 685 arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n\n2. It creates an empty set called `original_set`.\n\n3. It iterates through all the input sets using a `for` loop.\n\n4. For each set, it uses the `update()` method to add all elements from that set to `original_set`. This method ensures that duplicate elements are automatically removed.\n\n5. After processing all sets, it returns `original_set`, which will contain all unique elements from all input sets.\n\nThe function guarantees that:\n- The returned set contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n- It is the smallest such set, as it only includes elements that appear in at least one of the input sets.\n- It works with any number of distinct sets of integers.\n\nWhen called with 685 distinct sets as arguments, it will return the smallest set that is a superset of all input sets.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=289))
