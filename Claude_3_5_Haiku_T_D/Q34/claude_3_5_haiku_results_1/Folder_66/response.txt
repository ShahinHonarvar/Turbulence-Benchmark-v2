Message(id='msg_01KZ6Qfud2zJJDewhnfvYdgx', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    if len(args) != 25:\n        raise ValueError("Function must be called with exactly 25 sets")\n    \n    original_set = set()\n    for arg_set in args:\n        original_set.update(arg_set)\n    \n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The function uses `*args` to accept exactly 25 arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n\n2. It first checks if exactly 25 sets were passed. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It creates an empty set called `original_set`.\n\n4. It iterates through each input set and uses the `update` method to add all elements from each set to `original_set`.\n\n5. The `update` method automatically handles duplicates, ensuring that each element appears only once in the resulting set.\n\n6. The function returns `original_set`, which will be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\nThis implementation ensures that:\n- Exactly 25 sets are required as input\n- The returned set contains all unique elements from the input sets\n- The returned set is the smallest possible set that contains all elements from the input sets', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=307))
