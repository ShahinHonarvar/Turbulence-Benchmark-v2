The function `find_original_set` uses `*sets` to accept exactly 91 distinct sets as arguments.\n2. `set().union(*sets)` creates a new set that contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n3. By using the `*` unpacking operator, all sets are passed as separate arguments to the `union()` method.\n4. The resulting set is the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets, effectively making each input set a subset of the returned set.\n\nThe function will work for any number of sets, but the problem specification requires exactly 91 sets. It handles the requirements by creating a minimal set that encompasses all elements from the input sets.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=196))
