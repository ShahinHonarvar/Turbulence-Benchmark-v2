It takes two distinct sets as arguments\n2. Uses the `union()` method to combine both sets\n3. Returns a single set that contains all unique elements from both input sets\n4. This ensures that the returned set is the smallest set where both input sets are subsets of it\n5. The function handles sets of integers\n6. If the sets have no common elements, the returned set will simply contain all elements from both input sets\n7. If the sets have overlapping elements, those elements will appear only once in the result\n\nThe time complexity is O(m+n), where m and n are the sizes of the input sets, and the space complexity is also O(m+n) to store the resulting set.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=201))
