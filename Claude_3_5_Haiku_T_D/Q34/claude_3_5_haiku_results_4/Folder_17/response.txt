Message(id='msg_01Uo24A2zb7TueDnyKUij6Yz', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python function that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    original_set = set()\n    for arg_set in args:\n        original_set.update(arg_set)\n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses `*args` to accept exactly 478 set arguments\n2. It creates an empty set called `original_set`\n3. It iterates through each input set and uses the `update()` method to add all elements from each set to `original_set`\n4. It returns `original_set`, which will contain all unique integers from all input sets\n5. The returned set will be the smallest set such that each input set is a subset of it, since it includes all elements from all input sets without duplicates\n\nThe function will work with any number of sets (though the specification requires exactly 478), and each set can have different integers. By using a set, we ensure that only unique elements are retained in the final result.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=231))
