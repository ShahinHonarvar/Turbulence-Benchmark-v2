Message(id='msg_01M61yE5AtA63fEyyeVDtBYh', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. The function `find_original_set` uses `*sets` to accept exactly 790 distinct sets as arguments.\n\n2. The `.union(*sets)` method combines all the input sets into a single set that contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n\n3. By using `set().union(*sets)`, we ensure that:\n   - All elements from all input sets are included in the result\n   - The returned set is the smallest possible set that contains all elements from the input sets\n   - Each input set is a subset of the returned set\n\n4. This approach guarantees that the resulting set contains every unique integer from all 790 input sets, effectively creating the smallest superset of all input sets.\n\nThe implementation is concise, efficient, and meets the exact requirements specified in the problem statement.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=230))
