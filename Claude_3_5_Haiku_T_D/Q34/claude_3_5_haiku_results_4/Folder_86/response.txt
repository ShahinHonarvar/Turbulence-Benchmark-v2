Message(id='msg_0133KoreCqELXd8KZmz5xVNr', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set.union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. The function uses `*sets` to accept exactly 162 distinct set arguments.\n2. `set.union(*sets)` takes all the input sets and creates a union of them.\n3. The resulting set contains all unique integers from all input sets.\n4. This ensures that the returned set is the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\nThe `set.union()` method efficiently combines all unique elements from the input sets into a single set, which will be the smallest possible set that contains all elements from the original sets.\n\nFor example:\n- If called with `find_original_set({1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4})`, it would return `{1,2,3,4}`\n- Each input set is a subset of the returned set\n- The returned set contains the minimum number of elements needed to include all elements from the input sets", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=245))
