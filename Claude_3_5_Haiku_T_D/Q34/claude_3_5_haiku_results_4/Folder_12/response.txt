Message(id='msg_014n1aSnorhar78azcRaZfQx', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The function `find_original_set` uses `*sets` to accept exactly 51 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n\n2. The `set().union(*sets)` method creates a new set that contains all unique elements from all the input sets.\n\n3. By using `set().union(*sets)`, we create a set that includes every element from all input sets, which guarantees that each input set is a subset of the resulting set.\n\n4. The function returns the smallest such set (the union of all input sets) that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\nThe function will work correctly as long as exactly 51 distinct sets are provided as arguments, each containing integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=210))
