Message(id='msg_01GQpswfQ6gnRMg9VxtJs9Tr', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python solution to find the smallest set that contains all the given sets as subsets:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. The function uses `*sets` to accept exactly 48 set arguments as a variable-length argument list.\n\n2. `set().union(*sets)` creates a new set by taking the union of all the input sets.\n\n3. This ensures that the returned set contains all unique elements from all the input sets.\n\n4. It will be the smallest possible set that contains all the input sets as subsets.\n\nThe `.union()` method efficiently combines all the input sets, removing any duplicates and creating a single set that encompasses all elements from the original sets.\n\nFor example:\n```python\nset1 = {1, 2, 3}\nset2 = {3, 4, 5}\nset3 = {5, 6, 7}\n# ... and so on for 48 sets total\nresult = find_original_set(set1, set2, set3, ...)\n```\n\nThe function will return a set containing all unique elements from the 48 input sets.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=278))
