Message(id='msg_012aH8D8uZrFZSMB9aE29vWF', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function that satisfies the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis solution works as follows:\n\n1. The function takes a variable number of arguments using `*sets`, which allows exactly 28 distinct sets to be passed.\n\n2. The `.union(*sets)` method efficiently combines all the input sets into a single set.\n\n3. By using `.union()`, the function creates a set that contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n\n4. Since sets only store unique elements, the resulting set is guaranteed to be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\n5. This approach ensures that each input set is a subset of the returned set.\n\nThe function will work correctly even if the input sets have different sizes or overlapping elements, always returning the smallest possible set that includes all elements from the input sets.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=210))
