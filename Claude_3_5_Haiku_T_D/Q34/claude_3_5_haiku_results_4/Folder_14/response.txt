Message(id='msg_01Gmiqck6HuXcL3UVtPE7C7p', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 13:\n        raise ValueError("Exactly 13 sets must be provided")\n    \n    if len(set(len(s) for s in sets)) != len(sets):\n        raise ValueError("All sets must have distinct lengths")\n    \n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis solution does the following:\n\n1. The function uses `*sets` to accept exactly 13 arguments, which are sets of integers.\n\n2. It first checks if exactly 13 sets are provided. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It then checks if all sets have distinct lengths by creating a set of set lengths and comparing its length to the number of sets. If they\'re not the same, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n4. The function uses `set().union(*sets)` to create a union of all the input sets, which will be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\n5. This union method ensures that the returned set includes all unique elements from the input sets, making it the smallest set that satisfies the condition of being a superset of all input sets.\n\nThe function will work with any 13 sets of integers, where each set has a unique length, and return the smallest set that contains all elements from those sets.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=317))
