Message(id='msg_01ET3K7suwJhNKyD6fzrC93J', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(set1, set2, set3, set4, set5, set6, set7, set8, set9):\n    return set.union(set1, set2, set3, set4, set5, set6, set7, set8, set9)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The function takes exactly 9 arguments, each of which is expected to be a set of integers.\n\n2. It uses the `set.union()` method to combine all 9 sets into a single set.\n\n3. The resulting set will contain all unique elements from the input sets, effectively creating the smallest set that contains all input sets as subsets.\n\n4. Since sets only store unique elements, duplicate elements are automatically removed.\n\nThe function will return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it. If any of the input sets are overlapping or have common elements, those will be consolidated into a single set.\n\nFor example:\n- If `set1 = {1, 2}`, `set2 = {2, 3}`, and so on for the other sets, the function would return `{1, 2, 3, ...}`.\n- The returned set will be the union of all input sets, which is the smallest set that contains all input sets as subsets.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=328))
