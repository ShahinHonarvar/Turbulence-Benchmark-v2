Message(id='msg_01DZVvZGut5ok3D51iARczG5', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 15:\n        raise ValueError("Exactly 15 sets must be provided")\n    \n    unique_elements = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        unique_elements.update(s)\n    \n    return unique_elements\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The function uses `*sets` to accept exactly 15 sets as arguments.\n\n2. It first checks if exactly 15 sets are provided. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It creates an empty set called `unique_elements`.\n\n4. It iterates through each set in the input sets and uses the `update()` method to add all elements from each set to `unique_elements`.\n\n5. The `unique_elements` set will contain all unique elements from all input sets, which is the smallest set that contains all the original sets as subsets.\n\n6. It returns the `unique_elements` set.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Exactly 15 sets are provided\n- All elements from the input sets are included in the result\n- The returned set is the smallest possible set that contains all input sets as subsets\n- Duplicate elements are automatically removed due to the set data structure', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=303))
