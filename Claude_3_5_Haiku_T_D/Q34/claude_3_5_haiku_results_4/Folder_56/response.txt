Message(id='msg_01WqGapKA6nbNQYEHH1vRub9', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 63:\n        raise ValueError("Function must be called with exactly 63 sets")\n    \n    original_set = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        original_set.update(s)\n    \n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The function uses `*sets` to accept exactly 63 sets as arguments.\n\n2. It first checks if the number of sets passed is exactly 63 using `len(sets)`. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It creates an empty set called `original_set`.\n\n4. It iterates through all the input sets and uses `update()` to add all elements from each set to `original_set`.\n\n5. After processing all sets, `original_set` will contain all unique elements from the input sets.\n\n6. The function returns `original_set`, which is guaranteed to be the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Exactly 63 sets are passed as arguments\n- All elements from the input sets are included in the returned set\n- The returned set is the smallest such set, as it uses a set which automatically removes duplicates\n- Each input set is a subset of the returned set', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=321))
