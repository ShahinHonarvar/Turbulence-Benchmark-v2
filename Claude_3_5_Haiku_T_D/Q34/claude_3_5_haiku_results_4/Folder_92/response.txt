Message(id='msg_01J6WnJ2FRNdRh7i75nJ9wVR', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set.union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The function `find_original_set` uses `*sets` to accept exactly 8 distinct sets as arguments.\n\n2. `set.union(*sets)` takes all the input sets and creates a union of them, which is the smallest set that contains all elements from each input set.\n\n3. The function will return this union set, which is the smallest set that satisfies the requirement that each of the input sets is a subset of it.\n\nThe function will work correctly because:\n- It uses `set.union()` which combines all unique elements from the input sets\n- It returns a set that includes every element from all input sets\n- It creates the smallest possible set that contains all elements from the original sets\n\nWhen called with 8 distinct sets of integers, it will return a set containing all unique elements from those sets.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=230))
