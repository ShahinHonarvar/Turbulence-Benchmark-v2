It retrieves the value at index 22 of the input tuple as `x`.\n\n4. It iterates through numbers from `x-1` down to 2.\n\n5. For each number, it checks if it and all its right-truncated versions are prime.\n\n6. If a number is right-truncatable (remains prime when digits are successively removed from the right), it is added to the result list.\n\n7. The result list is returned in descending order, which is achieved by iterating from `x-1` downwards.\n\n8. If no such right-truncatable primes are found, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=172, output_tokens=414))
