It takes a single argument `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers\n2. It uses list slicing with start and end indices both set to 222\n3. This means it will return an empty list, since the slice is exclusive of both indices\n4. If the input list has fewer than 223 elements, it will also return an empty list\n\nThe function follows the specification precisely by returning the list of all elements from index 221 to index 222, both exclusive.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=155))
