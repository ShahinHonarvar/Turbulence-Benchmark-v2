Message(id='msg_01TuGwwMrcrd7hC37bhHcXX6', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[42:69] if num % -82 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to filter the input list `nums`\n2. It takes a slice of the list from index 42 to 69 (which excludes index 41 and 69)\n3. It checks each number in this slice to see if it is not divisible by -82 (using the modulo operator `%`)\n4. If a number is not divisible by -82, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list will be returned\n\nThe slice `nums[42:69]` ensures that only elements from index 42 to 68 (both exclusive) are considered, and the condition `num % -82 != 0` checks divisibility by -82.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=236))
