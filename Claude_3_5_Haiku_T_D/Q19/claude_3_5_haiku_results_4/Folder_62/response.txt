Message(id='msg_01RUKFNf3NLq9MmHH4M5pKQ5', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst[16:92] if num % 59 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list.\n2. It takes the input list `lst` and slices it from index 16 to 92 (exclusive), which means starting from index 16 up to but not including index 92.\n3. For each number `num` in this slice, it checks if the number is not divisible by 59 using the modulo operator `%`.\n4. If a number is not divisible by 59, it is included in the resulting list.\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Using list slicing `lst[16:92]` to cover the range from index 15 to 92 (exclusive)\n- Filtering out numbers divisible by 59\n- Returning an empty list if no such numbers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=261))
