Message(id='msg_01QDHe5uDSBdikqn1NGwp1Vs', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[71:98] if num % -88 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 71 to 98 (exclusive of index 98)\n3. It filters the numbers by checking if each number is not divisible by -88\n4. It returns the list of integers that meet the condition\n5. If no integers are found in the specified range that are not divisible by -88, an empty list will be returned\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Taking a list of integers as input\n- Starting at index 70 (which corresponds to the 71st element due to zero-based indexing)\n- Ending before index 98\n- Checking divisibility by -88\n- Returning all integers that are not divisible by -88 in that range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=244))
