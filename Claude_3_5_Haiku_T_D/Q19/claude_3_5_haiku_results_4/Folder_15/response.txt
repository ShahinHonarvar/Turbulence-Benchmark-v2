It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` starting from index 3 (which means from index 0 to index 2 are skipped).\n2. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is not divisible by -2 using the modulo operator `%`.\n3. If the number is not divisible by -2, it is included in the resulting list.\n4. If no numbers meet the condition, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=178))
