Message(id='msg_013sea4taQW6CWnhDGYer7m9', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers[21:50] if num % 40 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `numbers` from index 21 to 49 (index 20 to 50, both exclusive).\n2. For each number in that range, it checks if the number is not divisible by 40 (using the modulo operator `%`).\n3. If the number is not divisible by 40, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function handles the specific requirements by:\n- Slicing the list from index 21 to 49 to get elements from index 20 to 50 (exclusive)\n- Filtering out numbers divisible by 40\n- Returning the resulting list of integers", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=236))
