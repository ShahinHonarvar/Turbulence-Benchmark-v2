Message(id='msg_01F1ZfFNpfqpp1yNFRyZfCF9', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[3:] if num % -2 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list.\n2. It starts iterating from index 3 (which means index 0 to 2 are excluded) using `nums[3:]`.\n3. For each number `num` in that slice, it checks if the number is not divisible by -2 using the modulo operator `%`.\n4. If a number is not divisible by -2, it is included in the resulting list.\n5. If no numbers meet the condition, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Skipping the first three indices\n- Checking divisibility by -2\n- Returning all non-divisible integers in a new list\n- Returning an empty list if no such integers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=240))
