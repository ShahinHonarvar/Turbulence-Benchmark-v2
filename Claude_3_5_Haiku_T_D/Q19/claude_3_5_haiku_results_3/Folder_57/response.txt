Message(id='msg_014jZR8YS4EcdpeCJxyQ1xu5', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[57:88] if num % -59 != 0]\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list.\n2. It slices the input list from index 57 to index 88 (index 56 is exclusive, index 88 is exclusive).\n3. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is not divisible by -59.\n4. If a number is not divisible by -59, it is included in the returned list.\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Using list slicing to get elements from index 57 to 87\n- Using the modulo operator `%` to check divisibility\n- Returning the filtered list of numbers not divisible by -59", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=232))
