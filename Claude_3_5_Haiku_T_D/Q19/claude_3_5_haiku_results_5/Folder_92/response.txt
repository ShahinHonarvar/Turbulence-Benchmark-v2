Message(id='msg_017gvzCZGq4dCArtTZUY8DDA', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    if len(nums) <= 2:\n        return []\n    \n    return [num for num in nums[2:] if num % -1 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. First, it checks if the input list `nums` has 2 or fewer elements. If so, it returns an empty list since there are no integers from index 0 to 1 (exclusive).\n2. If the list has more than 2 elements, it uses a list comprehension to:\n   - Iterate through elements starting from index 2 (which means from index 0 to 1 are excluded)\n   - Check if each number is not divisible by -1 (which means all numbers except 0 will be included)\n3. Returns the list of integers that meet the condition\n\nThe function handles the edge cases by returning an empty list when there are not enough elements, and correctly filters the list based on the divisibility condition.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=253))
