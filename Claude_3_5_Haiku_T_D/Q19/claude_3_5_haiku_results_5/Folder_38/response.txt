Message(id='msg_01FzyVLS2V6fZWj8TybtwYc8', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[33:54] if num % -97 != 0]\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list.\n2. It starts from index 33 (just after index 32) and goes up to, but not including, index 54.\n3. It checks each number in that range to see if it is not divisible by -97 using the modulo operator `%`.\n4. If a number is not divisible by -97 (i.e., the remainder is not zero), it is included in the resulting list.\n5. If no such numbers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.\n\nThe function meets all the requirements specified in the original text:\n- Takes a list of integers as an argument\n- Returns integers not divisible by -97\n- Uses indices 33 to 53 (exclusive of indices 32 and 54)\n- Returns an empty list if no qualifying integers are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=264))
