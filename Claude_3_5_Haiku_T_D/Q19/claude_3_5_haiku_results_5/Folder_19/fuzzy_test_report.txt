Out of 3 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 2 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-35, 189, -204, -377, -116, -363, 81]


The correct answer was:

[]

But the LLM code returned:
[-363]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

[-217, 283, 312, -88, -105, -266, 12]

======================================================================================================================================================

(3) Test input:

[-309, 417, 370, 464, -421, -28, 227]
