Message(id='msg_01CpVNkC2ryx1aUzRWwQwHFC', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_exclusive(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[1:7] if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` from index 1 to index 6 (excluding index 0 and index 7)\n2. It checks each number in that range to see if it's even by using the modulo operator `% 2 == 0`\n3. If a number is even, it's included in the returned list\n4. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned\n\nThe function satisfies all the requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as input\n- Returns even integers from index 1 to 6 (exclusive of both 0 and 7)\n- Will return an empty list if no even integers are found in that range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=124, output_tokens=229))
