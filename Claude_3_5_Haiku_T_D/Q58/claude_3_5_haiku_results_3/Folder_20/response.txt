It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different row and column ranges.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the size of the submatrix is exactly 49.\n4. If a submatrix with exactly 49 integers is found, it increments the count.\n5. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices that contain 49 integers.\n\nThe function works by:\n- Using `matrix.shape` to get the dimensions of the matrix\n- Nested loops to generate all possible submatrices\n- Slicing the matrix to extract each submatrix with `matrix[r1:r2+1, c1:c2+1]`\n- Checking the size of each submatrix with `submatrix.size`\n- Counting submatrices that match the condition", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=364))
