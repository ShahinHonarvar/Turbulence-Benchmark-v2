The function takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. It gets the number of rows and columns in the matrix.\n3. It initializes a counter to track the number of submatrices with 146 elements.\n4. It uses nested loops to iterate through all possible submatrices:\n   - `r1` and `r2` define the row range of the submatrix\n   - `c1` and `c2` define the column range of the submatrix\n5. For each possible submatrix, it checks if the size of the submatrix is exactly 146.\n6. If a submatrix with 146 elements is found, the counter is incremented.\n7. Finally, the total count of submatrices with 146 elements is returned.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^4), where n is the dimension of the matrix, as it uses four nested loops to check all possible submatrices.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=366))
