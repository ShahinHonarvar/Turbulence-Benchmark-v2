It takes a two-dimensional NumPy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices of the input matrix.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the number of elements is exactly 60.\n4. If a submatrix with 60 elements is found, it increments the count.\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, it returns the total count of submatrices with 60 elements.\n6. If no submatrix with 60 elements is found, the function returns 0.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(m^2 * n^2), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=327))
