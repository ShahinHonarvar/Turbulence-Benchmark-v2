It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices of the given matrix.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the number of elements is exactly 92.\n4. If a submatrix with 92 elements is found, it increments a counter.\n5. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 92 elements.\n\nThe function handles different matrix sizes and checks every possible submatrix configuration. The loops ensure that all possible rectangular submatrices are considered:\n- `r1` and `r2` control the row range\n- `c1` and `c2` control the column range\n- `matrix[r1:r2+1, c1:c2+1]` extracts the submatrix\n- `submatrix.size` gives the total number of elements in the submatrix\n\nIf no submatrix with exactly 92 elements is found, the function will return 0.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=380))
