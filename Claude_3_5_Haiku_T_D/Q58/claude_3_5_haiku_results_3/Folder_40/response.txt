It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if all elements are 1 using `np.count_nonzero(submatrix == 1) == submatrix.size`.\n4. If a submatrix contains only 1s, it increments the count.\n5. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with all 1s.\n\nThe time complexity is O(m²n²), where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=317))
