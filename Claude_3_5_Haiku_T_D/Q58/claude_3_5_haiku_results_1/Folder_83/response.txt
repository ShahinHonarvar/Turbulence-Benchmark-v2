It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by iterating through different start and end row and column indices.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks two conditions:\n   - The submatrix is not empty\n   - The number of non-zero elements in the submatrix is exactly 47\n4. It increments a counter for each submatrix that satisfies these conditions.\n5. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 47 integers.\n\nThe function uses numpy's `count_nonzero()` method to count the number of non-zero elements in each submatrix, which effectively counts the number of integers in the submatrix.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=347))
