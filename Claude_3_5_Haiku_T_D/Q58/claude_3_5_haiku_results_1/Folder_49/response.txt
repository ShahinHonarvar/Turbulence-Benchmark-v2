It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to iterate through all possible submatrices.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements is exactly 72.\n4. If a submatrix has 72 elements, it increments a counter.\n5. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 72 elements.\n\nThe time complexity is O(m²n²), where m and n are the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=278))
