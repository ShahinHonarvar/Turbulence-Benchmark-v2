The function takes a numpy matrix as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to iterate through all possible submatrices:\n   - `r1` and `r2` define the row range\n   - `c1` and `c2` define the column range\n\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements is exactly 74.\n\n4. If a submatrix with 74 elements is found, the count is incremented.\n\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, the function returns the total count.\n\nThe implementation ensures that:\n- All possible rectangular submatrices are considered\n- The size of each submatrix is exactly 74 elements\n- If no such submatrix exists, 0 is returned\n- It works with numpy matrices of varying sizes", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=339))
