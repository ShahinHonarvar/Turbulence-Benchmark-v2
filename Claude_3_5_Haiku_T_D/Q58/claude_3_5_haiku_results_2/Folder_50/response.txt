Message(id='msg_01Jbbx9QaLDutT2bqJhGgwUt', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    \n    for r1 in range(rows):\n        for r2 in range(r1, rows):\n            for c1 in range(cols):\n                for c2 in range(c1, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[r1:r2+1, c1:c2+1]\n                    if submatrix.size == 40:\n                        count += 1\n    \n    return count\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements (size) is exactly 40.\n\n4. If a submatrix with 40 elements is found, it increments the count.\n\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, it returns the total count of submatrices with 40 elements.\n\n6. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return 0.\n\nThe function uses numpy's matrix slicing to extract submatrices efficiently and checks their size using the `.size` attribute.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=325))
