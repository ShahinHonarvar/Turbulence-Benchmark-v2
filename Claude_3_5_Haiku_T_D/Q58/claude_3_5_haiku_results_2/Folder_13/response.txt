It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements is exactly 175.\n4. If a submatrix with 175 elements is found, it increments a counter.\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, it returns the total count of submatrices with 175 elements.\n6. If no such submatrix is found, it returns 0.\n\nThe function works by systematically exploring all possible submatrices by varying the start and end rows and columns, then checking the size of each resulting submatrix.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=337))
