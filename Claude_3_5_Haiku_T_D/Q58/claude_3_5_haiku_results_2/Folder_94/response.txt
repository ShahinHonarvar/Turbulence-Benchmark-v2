The function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It initializes a count variable to track the number of submatrices with 93 integers.\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices:\n   - Outer loops define the starting and ending rows\n   - Inner loops define the starting and ending columns\n4. For each possible submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements is exactly 93.\n5. If a submatrix with 93 elements is found, the count is incremented.\n6. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 93 integers.\n\nThe function uses numpy's slicing capabilities to efficiently extract submatrices and check their size.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=323))
