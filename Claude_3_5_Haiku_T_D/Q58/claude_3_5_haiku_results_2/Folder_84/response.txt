Takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. Uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices of the input matrix.\n3. For each submatrix, checks if its total number of elements is exactly 127.\n4. Increments a counter for each submatrix that meets the condition.\n5. Returns the total count of submatrices with exactly 127 integers.\n\nThe function works by:\n- Using matrix slicing to extract submatrices\n- Checking the size of each submatrix using `.size`\n- Counting the number of submatrices that have 127 elements\n\nIf no submatrices with 127 elements are found, the function returns 0 as specified.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=323))
