The function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to consider all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n\n3. For each potential submatrix:\n   - Extract the submatrix using numpy slicing\n   - Check if the size of the submatrix is exactly 51\n   - If it is, increment the count\n\n4. After checking all possible submatrices, return the total count of submatrices with 51 elements.\n\n5. If no submatrices with 51 elements are found, the function will return 0.\n\nThe function handles various matrix sizes and ensures that submatrices of exactly 51 elements are counted.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=324))
