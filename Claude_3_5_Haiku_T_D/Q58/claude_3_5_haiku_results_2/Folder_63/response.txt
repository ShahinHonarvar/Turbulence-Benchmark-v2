It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It calculates the dimensions of the matrix using `matrix.shape`.\n3. It initializes a `total_count` variable to 0 to track the number of submatrices.\n4. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n5. For each submatrix, it checks:\n   - If the submatrix is not empty\n   - If the number of non-zero elements in the submatrix is exactly 57\n6. If a submatrix meets these conditions, it increments the `total_count`.\n7. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 57 integers.\n\nThe function uses numpy's `count_nonzero()` method to efficiently count the number of non-zero elements in a submatrix.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=374))
