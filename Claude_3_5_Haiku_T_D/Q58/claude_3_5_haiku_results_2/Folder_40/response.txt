It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end row and column indices.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements in the submatrix is equal to the number of 1s in that submatrix.\n4. If the condition is met, it increments the count.\n5. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices containing only 1s.\n\nThe time complexity is O(rows²cols²), as it checks all possible submatrices.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=306))
