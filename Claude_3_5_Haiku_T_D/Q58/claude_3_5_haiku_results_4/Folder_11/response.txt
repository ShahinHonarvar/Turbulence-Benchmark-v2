It takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices:\n   - `r1` and `r2` define the row range\n   - `c1` and `c2` define the column range\n\n3. For each generated submatrix:\n   - It checks if the size of the submatrix is exactly 38\n   - If the size is 38, it increments the count\n\n4. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices with 38 elements\n\nThe function uses numpy's slice-based matrix indexing to efficiently extract submatrices and check their size.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=299))
