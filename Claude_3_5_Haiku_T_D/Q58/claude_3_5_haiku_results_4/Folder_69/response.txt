The function takes a 2D numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to iterate through all possible submatrices of the given matrix.\n3. For each possible submatrix, it checks if the number of elements in that submatrix is exactly 126.\n4. If a submatrix with 126 elements is found, the count is incremented.\n5. Finally, the total count of submatrices with 126 elements is returned.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(rows^2 * cols^2), where rows and cols are the dimensions of the input matrix.\n\nKey points:\n- Uses numpy matrix slicing to extract submatrices\n- Checks the size of each submatrix using `.size`\n- Handles cases where no submatrices with 126 elements exist by returning 0', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=341))
