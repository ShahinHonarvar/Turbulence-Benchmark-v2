The function takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different row and column ranges.\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements (submatrix.size) is exactly 176.\n4. If a submatrix with 176 elements is found, it increments the count.\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, it returns the total count of submatrices with 176 elements.\n6. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return 0.\n\nThe time complexity is O(m²n²), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively, as it checks all possible submatrices.', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=323))
