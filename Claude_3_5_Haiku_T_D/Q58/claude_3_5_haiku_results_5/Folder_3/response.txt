It takes a 2D numpy matrix as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different starting and ending rows and columns.\n\n3. For each possible submatrix:\n   - It extracts the submatrix using numpy's slice notation.\n   - It checks if the size of the submatrix is exactly 54.\n   - If the submatrix size is 54, it increments the count.\n\n4. After checking all possible submatrices, it returns the total count of submatrices with exactly 54 integers.\n\n5. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return 0.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m²n²), where m and n are the dimensions of the input matrix.\n\nThe function handles cases with different matrix sizes and configurations, returning the count of submatrices with exactly 54 integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=368))
