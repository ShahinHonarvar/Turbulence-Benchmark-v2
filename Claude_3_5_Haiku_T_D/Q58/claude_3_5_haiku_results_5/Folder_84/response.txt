Message(id='msg_01Vq2fjwv5bpZaPVfb6dFpQk', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    \n    for r1 in range(rows):\n        for r2 in range(r1, rows):\n            for c1 in range(cols):\n                for c2 in range(c1, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[r1:r2+1, c1:c2+1]\n                    if submatrix.size == 127:\n                        count += 1\n    \n    return count\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n\n3. For each submatrix:\n   - It extracts the submatrix using numpy slicing\n   - Checks if the size of the submatrix is exactly 127\n   - If so, increments the count\n\n4. After checking all possible submatrices, it returns the total count of submatrices with exactly 127 elements.\n\n5. If no submatrix is found with 127 elements, it will return 0.\n\nThe function works with numpy matrices and efficiently checks all possible submatrices using nested iteration and numpy's size property.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=326))
