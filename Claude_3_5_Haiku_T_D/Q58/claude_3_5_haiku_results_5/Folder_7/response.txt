The function takes a two-dimensional NumPy matrix as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by selecting different start and end rows and columns.\n\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements in the submatrix is exactly 121.\n\n4. If a submatrix with 121 elements is found, the count is incremented.\n\n5. After checking all possible submatrices, the function returns the total count of submatrices with 121 elements.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m²n²), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=314))
