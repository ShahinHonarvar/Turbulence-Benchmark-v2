It takes a numpy matrix as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible submatrices by varying the start and end rows and columns.\n\n3. For each submatrix, it checks if the total number of elements is exactly 91.\n\n4. If a submatrix with exactly 91 elements is found, the count is incremented.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the total count of submatrices containing 91 elements.\n\nThe function works as follows:\n- `rows, cols = matrix.shape` gets the dimensions of the input matrix\n- The nested loops `r1, r2, c1, c2` define the boundaries of each possible submatrix\n- `submatrix = matrix[r1:r2+1, c1:c2+1]` extracts the current submatrix\n- `submatrix.size == 91` checks if the submatrix has exactly 91 elements\n- If a submatrix matches the condition, `count` is incremented\n- The final `count` is returned, representing the number of submatrices with 91 elements', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=402))
