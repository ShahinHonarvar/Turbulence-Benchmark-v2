The function takes a circular list as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the sublists with a product of 28.\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist.\n4. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements:\n   - It uses modulo `% length` to wrap around the list, creating a circular list behavior.\n   - It builds the sublist and calculates its product.\n5. If the product equals 28, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n6. Finally, it returns the list of sublists with a product of 28.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using the modulo operator to wrap around the list indices, ensuring that sublists can wrap around the end of the list back to the beginning.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=400))
