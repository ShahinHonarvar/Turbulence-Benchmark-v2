The function takes a circular list of integers `nums` as input.\n\n2. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the sublists that have a product of -93.\n\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting index of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `length` determines the length of the sublist.\n\n4. For each start index and length combination:\n   - It creates an empty `current_list`.\n   - It initializes `product` to 1.\n   - It builds the sublist by wrapping around the circular list using modular arithmetic `(start + i) % n`.\n   - It multiplies each element to calculate the product.\n\n5. If the product equals -93, the current sublist is added to the `result`.\n\n6. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing all sublists with a product of -93.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using modular arithmetic to wrap around the list indices. It ensures that:\n- Sublists can start at any index\n- Sublists can be of varying lengths\n- Sublists wrap around the circular list\n- Duplicate sublists are included\n- An empty list is returned if no sublists match the condition", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=442))
