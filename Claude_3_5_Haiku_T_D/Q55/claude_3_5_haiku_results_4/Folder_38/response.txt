Message(id='msg_01GE9makzMkLbRQCkEwP9Csm', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    result = []\n    \n    for start in range(n):\n        for end in range(start, start + n):\n            sublist = []\n            product = 1\n            \n            for j in range(start, end + 1):\n                idx = j % n\n                sublist.append(arr[idx])\n                product *= arr[idx]\n            \n            if product == -23:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the requirements:\n\n1. It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It checks all possible contiguous sublists by using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list.\n3. It calculates the product of each sublist.\n4. If the product is -23, it adds the sublist to the result.\n5. It allows sublists of any size up to the length of the original list.\n6. It includes all sublists that have a product of -23.\n7. Returns an empty list if no such sublists exist.\n8. The order of sublists in the returned list is not guaranteed.\n\nThe function uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists by:\n- Iterating through possible start indices\n- Generating sublists by wrapping around the list using modulo arithmetic\n- Calculating the product of each sublist\n- Storing sublists with a product of -23 in the result list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=356))
