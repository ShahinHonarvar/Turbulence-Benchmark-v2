It takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list:\n   - The outer loop (`start`) determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop (`end`) determines the ending point of the sublist.\n\n3. For each potential sublist:\n   - It creates a new sublist and calculates its product.\n   - It uses modulo arithmetic (`i % n`) to wrap around the list, simulating the circular nature.\n   - It adds elements to the sublist and multiplies them to get the product.\n\n4. If the product of the sublist equals 100:\n   - The sublist is added to the `result` list.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the list of all sublists with a product of 100.\n\nThe function handles various scenarios:\n- It works with circular lists of any length.\n- It finds all sublists with a product of 100, including duplicates.\n- It returns an empty list if no such sublists exist.\n- The order of sublists in the returned list is not guaranteed.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ³), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=438))
