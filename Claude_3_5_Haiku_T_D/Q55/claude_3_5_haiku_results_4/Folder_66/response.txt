The function takes a circular list of integers as input.\n\n2. It initializes an empty `result` list to store the sublists that have a product equal to 78.\n\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting index of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending index of the sublist.\n\n4. For each sublist:\n   - It creates an empty `sublist` and initializes the `product` to 1.\n   - It iterates through the elements of the circular list, wrapping around using modulo operation `% length`.\n   - It appends each element to the `sublist` and multiplies it with the `product`.\n\n5. If the `product` equals 78 and the `sublist` length is less than or equal to the original list length, the sublist is added to the `result`.\n\n6. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing all sublists with a product of 78.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using the modulo operation to wrap around the list indices, effectively treating the list as a circle.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=442))
