If the input list is empty, return an empty list.\n\n2. Get the length of the circular list.\n\n3. Iterate through all possible starting points in the list.\n\n4. For each starting point, consider all possible end points (1 to length of list).\n\n5. Create a sublist by wrapping around the circular list using modulo operation.\n\n6. Calculate the product of the sublist.\n\n7. If the product equals -17, add the sublist to the result list.\n\n8. Return the list of all sublists with product -17.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list when creating sublists. It considers all possible contiguous sublists, including those that wrap around the end of the list back to the beginning.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ³), where n is the length of the input list, as there are nested loops to generate all possible sublists.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=391))
