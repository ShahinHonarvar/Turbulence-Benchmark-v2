Message(id='msg_01ELPvjek89N3S2pTEvcDFfz', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    result = []\n    \n    for start in range(n):\n        for end in range(start, start + n):\n            sublist = [lst[i % n] for i in range(start, end + 1)]\n            \n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            \n            if product == 53:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The function takes a circular list `lst` as input.\n\n2. It initializes an empty list `result` to store sublists with a product of 53.\n\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop iterates through possible starting points\n   - The inner loop extends the sublist from the starting point\n\n4. For each potential sublist:\n   - It uses list comprehension with modulo `% n` to handle the circular nature of the list\n   - Calculates the product of all elements in the sublist\n   - If the product equals 53, it adds the sublist to the `result`\n\n5. It returns the `result` list, which contains all sublists with a product of 53.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list indices, ensuring that all possible contiguous sublists are considered, including those that wrap around the end of the list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=356))
