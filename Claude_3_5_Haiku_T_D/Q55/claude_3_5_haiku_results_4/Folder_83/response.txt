Message(id='msg_01NxD6ZK6bXmfD2ZNSaeqMuY', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = len(circular_list)\n    result = []\n    \n    for start in range(n):\n        for length in range(1, n + 1):\n            sublist = [circular_list[(start + i) % n] for i in range(length)]\n            \n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            \n            if product == -57:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation works as follows:\n\n1. `n` stores the length of the input circular list.\n\n2. An empty `result` list is initialized to store the sublists with a product of -57.\n\n3. The outer loop iterates through all possible starting positions in the circular list.\n\n4. The inner loop iterates through all possible sublist lengths from 1 to the list's length.\n\n5. A sublist is created using list comprehension, which wraps around the circular list using the modulo operator `% n`.\n\n6. The product of the sublist is calculated by multiplying all its elements.\n\n7. If the product equals -57, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n\n8. Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing all sublists with a product of -57.\n\nThe implementation handles circular lists by using the modulo operator to wrap around the list when creating sublists, ensuring that all possible contiguous sublists are checked.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=370))
