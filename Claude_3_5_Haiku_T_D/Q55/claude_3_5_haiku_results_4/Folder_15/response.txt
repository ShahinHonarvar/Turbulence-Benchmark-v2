Message(id='msg_015VR4JfgVzQEpj4jpA3orih', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = len(circular_list)\n    result = []\n    \n    for start in range(n):\n        for length in range(1, n + 1):\n            sublist = [circular_list[(start + i) % n] for i in range(length)]\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            \n            if product == -7:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses two nested loops:\n   - The outer loop iterates through all possible starting positions in the list.\n   - The inner loop iterates through all possible sublist lengths.\n\n3. For each combination of start position and length, it creates a sublist using list comprehension:\n   - It uses modulo arithmetic `(start + i) % n` to wrap around the list, creating a circular effect.\n   - This allows the sublist to wrap around the end of the list back to the beginning.\n\n4. It calculates the product of the sublist by multiplying all its elements.\n\n5. If the product equals -7, it adds the sublist to the result list.\n\n6. The function handles cases where:\n   - No sublists with product -7 exist (returns an empty list)\n   - Multiple sublists with product -7 exist (includes all of them)\n   - Sublists can be of any length up to the list size\n\n7. The order of sublists in the returned list is not guaranteed, as specified in the requirements.\n\nThis implementation works with both positive and negative integers and handles circular lists correctly.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=412))
