The function takes a circular list `arr` as input.\n\n2. It uses two nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist.\n\n3. For each potential sublist:\n   - It calculates the product of elements using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list.\n   - It keeps track of the elements in the sublist.\n\n4. If the product of the sublist equals -89, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n\n5. The function handles circular list traversal by using `index = j % n` to wrap around the list.\n\n6. It allows sublists of any size up to the length of the original list.\n\n7. If no sublists with a product of -89 are found, an empty list is returned.\n\n8. Duplicate sublists are preserved in the result.\n\nThis solution covers all the requirements specified in the problem statement.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=389))
