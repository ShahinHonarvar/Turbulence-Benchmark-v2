The function takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It finds all contiguous sublists within the circular list whose product equals 91.\n3. The sublists can wrap around the circular list.\n4. Each sublist's size can vary but must be smaller than or equal to the input list's size.\n5. If no sublists with a product of 91 exist, an empty list is returned.\n6. Duplicate sublists (if found) are included in the result.\n7. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nThe function works by:\n- Iterating through all possible starting points in the circular list\n- Creating sublists by extending from each starting point\n- Calculating the product of elements in the sublist\n- Checking if the product equals 91\n- Wrapping around the list using modulo indexing\n- Storing matching sublists in the result", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=409))
