The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It initializes an empty list `result` to store all sublists with a product of 40.\n\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists by varying the start and end indices.\n\n4. For each possible start index, it iterates through all possible end indices, wrapping around the circular list.\n\n5. It creates a sublist and calculates its product by iterating through the list elements.\n\n6. If the product becomes 40, it adds a copy of the current sublist to the `result` list.\n\n7. The modulo operator `%` is used to handle the circular nature of the list, allowing wrapping around the list.\n\n8. If no sublist with a product of 40 is found, an empty list is returned.\n\n9. The function handles duplicates by adding all matching sublists to the result.\n\nThe function meets all the specified requirements, including handling circular lists, finding all sublists with a product of 40, and returning an empty list if no such sublists exist.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=431))
