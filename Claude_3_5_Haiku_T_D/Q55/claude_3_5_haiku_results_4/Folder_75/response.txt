Message(id='msg_013oNk8Lky7khNDvLdSxzDkh', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = len(circular_list)\n    result = []\n    \n    for start in range(n):\n        for end in range(start, start + n):\n            sublist = []\n            product = 1\n            \n            for i in range(start, end + 1):\n                index = i % n\n                sublist.append(circular_list[index])\n                product *= circular_list[index]\n            \n            if product == 13:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` defines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` defines the ending point of the sublist.\n\n3. For each possible sublist:\n   - It creates an empty sublist and initializes the product to 1.\n   - It iterates through the elements of the sublist, using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the circular list.\n   - It multiplies each element into the product.\n   - If the product equals 13, it adds the sublist to the result.\n\n4. The function returns a list of all sublists with a product of 13.\n\n5. The implementation handles circular nature by using modulo arithmetic when accessing list elements.\n\n6. It captures all possible sublists, including those that wrap around the end of the list.\n\n7. If no sublists are found with a product of 13, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function will work with various input lists, finding all sublists that have a product of exactly 13, including duplicates if they exist.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=429))
