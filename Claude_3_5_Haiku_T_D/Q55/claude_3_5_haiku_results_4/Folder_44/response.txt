The function takes a circular list of integers as input.\n\n2. It first calculates the length of the list and initializes an empty `result` list to store sublists with product 29.\n\n3. To handle the circular nature of the list, it creates an extended list by appending all but the last element of the original list to itself. This allows checking continuous sublists that wrap around the list.\n\n4. It uses nested loops to generate all possible sublists:\n   - The outer loop iterates through all possible starting positions\n   - The inner loop iterates through all possible ending positions within the range of the list length\n\n5. For each sublist:\n   - It calculates the product of its elements\n   - If the product is exactly 29, it adds the sublist to the `result` list\n\n6. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing all sublists with product 29.\n\nThe function handles various scenarios:\n- Multiple sublists with product 29\n- Sublists of different sizes\n- Circular list property\n- Returns an empty list if no sublists match the condition", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=390))
