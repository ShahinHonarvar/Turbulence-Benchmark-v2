It takes a circular list `lst` as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in a circular manner:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist.\n\n3. For each possible sublist:\n   - It calculates the product of elements using modulo `n` to wrap around the list.\n   - It keeps track of the current sublist and its running product.\n\n4. If the product of the sublist equals -51:\n   - It adds a copy of the sublist to the `result` list.\n\n5. The function returns the list of all sublists with a product of -51.\n\nThe implementation handles circular lists by using the modulo operator `%` to wrap around the list indices. This ensures that sublists can wrap around from the end of the list back to the beginning.\n\nThe function will return all sublists of any size that have a product of -51, including duplicates if they exist, without regard to their order in the returned list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=407))
