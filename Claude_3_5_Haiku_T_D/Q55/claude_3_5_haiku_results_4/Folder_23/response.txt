It takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It iterates through all possible starting points in the circular list.\n\n3. For each starting point, it creates a sublist and calculates its product.\n\n4. It uses circular indexing with the modulo operator `%` to wrap around the list.\n\n5. If the product of the sublist equals -95, it adds the sublist to the result list.\n\n6. If the product exceeds -95, it breaks the inner loop to move to the next starting point.\n\n7. It handles cases where no sublists have a product of -95 by returning an empty list.\n\n8. It includes all possible sublists that have a product of -95, including duplicates.\n\nThe function works with circular lists of any size and returns sublists of varying lengths that meet the product condition.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=362))
