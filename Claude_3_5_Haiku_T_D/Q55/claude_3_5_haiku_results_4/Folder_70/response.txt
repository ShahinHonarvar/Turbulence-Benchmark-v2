The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists, considering the circular nature of the list.\n3. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements.\n4. If the product equals 32, the sublist is added to the result list.\n5. If the product exceeds 32, the inner loop breaks to avoid unnecessary iterations.\n6. The function handles circular list traversal using the modulo operator `% n`.\n7. If no sublist with a product of 32 is found, an empty list is returned.\n8. Duplicate sublists are allowed and will be included in the result.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the input list, as it explores all possible contiguous sublists.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=399))
