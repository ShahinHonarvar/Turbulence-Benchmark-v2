Message(id='msg_014LHNjudBQgKAgBBfej5SdK', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = len(circular_list)\n    result = []\n    \n    for start in range(n):\n        for end in range(start, start + n):\n            current_sublist = []\n            product = 1\n            \n            for i in range(start, end + 1):\n                current_index = i % n\n                current_sublist.append(circular_list[current_index])\n                product *= circular_list[current_index]\n            \n            if product == -15:\n                result.append(current_sublist)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation works as follows:\n\n1. The function takes a circular list as input.\n2. It uses two nested loops to generate all possible sublists by iterating through different starting points and ending points.\n3. For each combination of start and end points, it creates a sublist that wraps around the circular list using modulo arithmetic.\n4. It calculates the product of the elements in the current sublist.\n5. If the product equals -15, the sublist is added to the result list.\n6. The function handles the circular nature of the list by using `current_index = i % n` to wrap around the list.\n7. If no sublists with a product of -15 are found, an empty list is returned.\n8. Duplicate sublists are preserved in the result.\n\nThe function meets all the specified requirements, including handling circular lists, finding sublists with a product of -15, and returning all such sublists.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=387))
