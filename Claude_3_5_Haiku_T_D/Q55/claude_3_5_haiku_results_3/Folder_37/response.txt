The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It determines the length of the list.\n\n3. It initializes an empty list `result` to store sublists with product -76.\n\n4. It uses nested loops to generate all possible sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting index of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending index of the sublist.\n\n5. For each sublist, it calculates the product by multiplying the elements.\n   - It uses modulo `% n` to handle the circular nature of the list.\n   - It ensures that the index wraps around when it reaches the end of the list.\n\n6. If the product of the sublist equals -76 and the sublist is not empty, it adds the sublist to the `result`.\n\n7. Finally, it returns the list of sublists with product -76.\n\nThe function handles various scenarios:\n- It considers sublists of different sizes.\n- It treats the list as circular, allowing wrapping around the list.\n- It handles duplicates by including them in the result.\n- It returns an empty list if no sublists with the specified product are found.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=453))
