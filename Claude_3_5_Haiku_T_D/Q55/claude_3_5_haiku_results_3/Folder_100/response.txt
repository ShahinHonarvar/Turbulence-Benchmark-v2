The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists. The outer loop selects the starting point, and the inner loop determines the end point.\n\n3. For each start and end combination, it creates a sublist and calculates its product.\n\n4. It uses modulo arithmetic (`% n`) to wrap around the list, simulating a circular list.\n\n5. While building the sublist, it keeps track of the product.\n\n6. If the product equals 48, it adds the current sublist to the result list.\n\n7. If the product exceeds 48, it breaks the inner loop to avoid unnecessary computations.\n\n8. The function returns a list of all sublists with a product of 48.\n\n9. The implementation handles duplicates by keeping them in the result list.\n\n10. The order of sublists in the returned list is not guaranteed to be in any specific order.\n\nThe function works with circular lists of any size and returns all sublists of contiguous elements that have a product of 48.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=443))
