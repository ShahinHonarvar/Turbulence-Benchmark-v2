It takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It finds all contiguous sublists whose product equals 51.\n3. It handles the circular nature of the list by using modulo arithmetic (`i % n`) to wrap around the list.\n4. It returns a list of sublists that satisfy the condition.\n5. If no such sublist exists, it returns an empty list.\n6. It includes all possible sublists, even if they are duplicates.\n7. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nThe function works by:\n- Iterating through all possible starting points in the list.\n- For each starting point, creating sublists of varying lengths.\n- Calculating the product of each sublist.\n- If the product equals 51, adding the sublist to the result.\n- Finally, returning the list of sublists with a product of 51.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=369))
