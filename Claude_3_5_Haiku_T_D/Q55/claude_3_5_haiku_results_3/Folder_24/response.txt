It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It iterates through all possible starting points in the list.\n3. For each starting point, it explores all possible sublists by varying the ending point.\n4. When generating a sublist, it wraps around the list using modulo arithmetic to simulate the circular nature.\n5. It calculates the product of each sublist.\n6. If the product equals -89, it adds the sublist to the result list.\n7. It handles duplicates by including all sublists that match the condition.\n8. The order of sublists in the returned list is not guaranteed.\n9. If no sublist with a product of -89 is found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^3), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=353))
