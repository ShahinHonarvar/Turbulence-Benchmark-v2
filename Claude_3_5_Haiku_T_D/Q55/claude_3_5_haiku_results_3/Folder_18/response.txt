It takes a circular list `lst` as input.\n\n2. It uses two nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop iterates through possible starting indices\n   - The inner loop iterates through possible sublist lengths\n\n3. For each sublist, it calculates the product of elements and builds the sublist.\n\n4. It uses modulo (`%`) arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the list, allowing wrapping around from the end to the beginning.\n\n5. If the product of a sublist equals 36, it adds that sublist to the result list.\n\n6. It checks all possible sublists of all possible lengths and starting points.\n\n7. If no sublists with a product of 36 are found, it returns an empty list.\n\n8. Duplicate sublists are preserved in the returned list.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using modulo arithmetic when accessing list elements, ensuring that sublists can wrap around the end of the list back to the beginning.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=387))
