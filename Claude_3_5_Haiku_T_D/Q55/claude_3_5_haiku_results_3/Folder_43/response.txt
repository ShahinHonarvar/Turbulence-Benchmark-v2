It takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `length` determines the length of the sublist.\n\n3. For each potential sublist:\n   - It calculates the product of all elements in the sublist.\n   - It uses modulo `% n` to wrap around the list, simulating a circular list.\n   - If the product is exactly -26, it adds the sublist to the result.\n\n4. It handles duplicate sublists by including all instances that meet the criteria.\n\n5. If no sublists with a product of -26 are found, it returns an empty list.\n\nThe function satisfies the requirements:\n- Works with a circular list\n- Returns sublists of any size up to the list length\n- Includes sublists with a product of -26\n- Returns all matching sublists, including duplicates\n- Returns an empty list if no sublists match", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=410))
