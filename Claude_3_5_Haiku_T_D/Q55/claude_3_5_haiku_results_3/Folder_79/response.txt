It takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It finds all contiguous sublists whose product is exactly -83.\n3. It handles the circular nature of the list by using modulo indexing.\n4. It returns all sublists that satisfy the product condition.\n5. It allows sublists of various lengths up to the list's size.\n6. If no sublists are found, it returns an empty list.\n7. It includes duplicate sublists if they exist.\n8. The order of sublists in the returned list is not guaranteed.\n\nThe function works by:\n- Iterating through all possible starting positions\n- For each start position, exploring all possible end positions\n- Calculating the product of elements in the sublist\n- Tracking elements in the current sublist\n- Adding the sublist to the result when its product equals -83", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=372))
