It takes a circular list `lst` as input.\n2. It initializes an empty `result` list to store sublists with a product of -81.\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `length` determines the size of the sublist.\n4. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements.\n5. If the product equals -81, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n6. The modulo operator `% n` is used to wrap around the list, creating a circular list effect.\n7. The function returns the list of sublists with a product of -81.\n\nThe function handles various cases:\n- It considers all possible starting points in the circular list.\n- It checks sublists of different lengths.\n- It includes duplicate sublists if they exist.\n- It returns an empty list if no sublists have a product of -81.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=376))
