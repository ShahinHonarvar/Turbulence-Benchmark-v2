It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list `result` to store sublists with product equal to -95.\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist.\n4. For each sublist:\n   - It calculates the product of elements using modulo arithmetic to handle circular list.\n   - If the product equals -95, the sublist is added to the `result`.\n5. It returns the list of sublists with product equal to -95.\n\nThe function handles the circular nature of the list by using modulo arithmetic when accessing list elements. This ensures that when the end of the list is reached, it wraps around to the beginning.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=364))
