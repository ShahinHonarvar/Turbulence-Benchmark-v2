It takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists by considering each possible starting point and length.\n\n3. For each starting point, it creates a sublist and calculates its product.\n\n4. When the product equals -82, it adds the current sublist to the result list.\n\n5. Because it's a circular list, it uses modulo arithmetic (`current_index % n`) to wrap around the list.\n\n6. The function handles cases of:\n   - Multiple sublists with product -82\n   - Sublists of different lengths\n   - No sublists with product -82\n\n7. If no sublists with product -82 are found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function meets all the specified requirements, including handling circular lists, finding sublists with product -82, and allowing duplicate sublists in the result.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=383))
