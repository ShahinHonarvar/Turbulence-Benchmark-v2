The function takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It initializes an empty `result` list to store sublists with product equal to 49.\n\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist\n\n4. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements.\n\n5. If the product equals 49, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n\n6. The modulo operation `(start + i) % list_length` ensures that the list is treated as circular, wrapping around when it reaches the end.\n\n7. The function returns the list of sublists with product 49, which can be empty if no such sublists exist.\n\nThis implementation handles various scenarios like:\n- Multiple sublists with product 49\n- Sublists of different lengths\n- Circular wrapping of the list\n- Empty result list if no matching sublists are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=403))
