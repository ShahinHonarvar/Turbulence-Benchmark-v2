The function takes a circular list as input and determines its length.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list:\n   - The outer loop iterates through possible starting points in the list.\n   - The inner loop iterates through possible ending points, wrapping around the list.\n\n3. For each potential sublist:\n   - It calculates the product of elements using modulo arithmetic to handle circular list access.\n   - If the product equals -36, the sublist is added to the result list.\n\n4. It handles wrapping around the list by using modulo (`%`) when accessing list indices.\n\n5. The function returns all sublists with a product of -36, which may include duplicates and sublists of varying lengths.\n\n6. If no sublists are found with a product of -36, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- It works with circular lists\n- It finds all possible sublists with a product of -36\n- It handles lists of any size\n- It returns an empty list if no matching sublists are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=397))
