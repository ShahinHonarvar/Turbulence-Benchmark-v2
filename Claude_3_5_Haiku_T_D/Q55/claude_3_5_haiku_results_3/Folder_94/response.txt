The function takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It iterates through all possible starting points and ending points in the circular list.\n3. For each iteration, it creates a sublist and calculates its product.\n4. If the product equals -30, the sublist is added to the result list.\n5. The function handles the circular nature of the list by using modulo arithmetic (`i % n`) to wrap around the list.\n6. If no sublists are found with a product of -30, an empty list is returned.\n7. Duplicate sublists are allowed in the result.\n8. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=356))
