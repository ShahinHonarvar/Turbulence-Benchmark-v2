If the input list is empty, return an empty list.\n\n2. Iterate through all possible starting positions in the circular list using `start`.\n\n3. For each starting position, consider all possible sublist lengths from 1 to the list's length.\n\n4. Calculate the product of elements in the current sublist, using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the circular list.\n\n5. If the product equals -20, add the sublist to the result.\n\n6. Return the list of sublists with product -20.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using `(start + i) % n` to calculate indices, which allows wrapping around the list.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the input list, as we consider all possible starting positions and sublist lengths.\n\nThe function will return lists of sublists where the product of elements in each sublist equals -20, including all possible sublists and their duplicates.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=387))
