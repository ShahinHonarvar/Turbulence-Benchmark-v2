It takes a circular list of integers as input\n2. It checks for all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list\n3. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements\n4. If the product equals 100, it adds the sublist to the result list\n5. It handles circular nature by using modulo arithmetic when accessing list elements\n6. It returns an empty list if no sublists are found with a product of 100\n7. It includes all possible sublists that have a product of 100, including duplicates\n8. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ³), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=321))
