The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list as input.\n2. It extends the circular list by concatenating it with itself to simulate circular behavior.\n3. It generates all possible contiguous sublists by using nested loops.\n4. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements.\n5. If the product equals 5, the sublist is added to the result list.\n6. The function returns a list of all sublists with product equal to 5.\n7. If no sublists have a product of 5, an empty list is returned.\n8. Duplicate sublists are allowed and will be included in the result.\n\nThe implementation handles circular lists by creating an extended list that allows wrapping around, and the sublists are generated to cover all possible contiguous segments.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=348))
