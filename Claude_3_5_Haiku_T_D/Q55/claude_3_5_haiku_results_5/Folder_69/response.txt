It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It iterates through all possible starting points in the list.\n3. For each starting point, it creates sublists of varying lengths.\n4. It calculates the product of elements in the sublist.\n5. If the product equals 90, it adds a copy of the sublist to the result list.\n6. It handles the circular nature of the list by using modulo arithmetic when accessing list elements.\n7. It can find multiple sublists with a product of 90.\n8. If no sublist is found with a product of 90, it returns an empty list.\n\nThe function works with sublists of any size less than or equal to the length of the input list, and it can handle duplicates by adding each matching sublist to the result.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=365))
