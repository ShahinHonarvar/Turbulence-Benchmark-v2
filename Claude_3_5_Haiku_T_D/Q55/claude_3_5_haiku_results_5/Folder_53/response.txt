It takes a circular list as input and initializes the target product `n` as -87.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop selects the starting point\n   - The inner loop determines the potential ending point\n\n3. For each potential sublist:\n   - It calculates the cumulative product\n   - If the product matches -87, it adds the sublist to the result\n   - If the product becomes less than -87, it stops expanding the sublist\n   - It uses modulo arithmetic to wrap around the circular list\n\n4. It returns a list of all sublists that have a product of -87, including duplicates if they exist.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using `current_index % length` to wrap around the list, ensuring that sublists can span the entire circular list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=406))
