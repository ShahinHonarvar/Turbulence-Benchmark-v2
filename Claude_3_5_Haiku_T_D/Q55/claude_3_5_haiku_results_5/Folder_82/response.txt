The function takes a circular list of integers `nums` as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist.\n\n3. For each potential sublist:\n   - It uses modulo `% n` to wrap around the list, creating a circular effect.\n   - It creates the sublist by extracting elements from the original list.\n\n4. It calculates the product of the sublist elements.\n\n5. If the product equals 8, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n\n6. After checking all possible sublists, the function returns the `result` list containing all sublists with a product of 8.\n\nThe implementation handles:\n- Circular list traversal\n- Sublists of varying lengths\n- Multiple occurrences of sublists with a product of 8\n- Returns an empty list if no sublists are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=375))
