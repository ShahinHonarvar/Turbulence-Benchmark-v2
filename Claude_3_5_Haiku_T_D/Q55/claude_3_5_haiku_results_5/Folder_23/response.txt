It takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting index of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `length` determines the size of the sublist.\n\n3. For each potential sublist:\n   - It uses list comprehension to create the sublist, taking into account the circular nature of the list by using modulo `% n`.\n   - It calculates the product of all elements in the sublist.\n\n4. If the product equals -95, it adds the sublist to the `result` list.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing all sublists with a product of -95.\n\nThe function handles the circular list property by using `(start + i) % n` when accessing list elements, which allows wrapping around the list when necessary.\n\nThe implementation ensures that:\n- All possible contiguous sublists are checked\n- Sublists can be of any size up to the length of the input list\n- Duplicate sublists are included if they exist\n- An empty list is returned if no sublists with a product of -95 are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=422))
