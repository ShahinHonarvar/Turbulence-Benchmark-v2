It takes a circular list `lst` as input.\n\n2. It initializes an empty `result` list to store sublists that have a product of 36.\n\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist.\n\n4. For each potential sublist:\n   - It creates a new `sublist` and initializes the `product` to 1.\n   - It iterates through the elements from `start` to `end`, using modulo `n` to wrap around the list.\n   - It appends each element to the `sublist` and multiplies the `product`.\n\n5. If the `product` equals 36, it adds the `sublist` to the `result`.\n\n6. The circular nature is achieved by using `i % n` to wrap around the list indices.\n\n7. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing all sublists with a product of 36.\n\nThe function handles various cases:\n- It works with circular lists\n- It finds all sublists of any size with a product of 36\n- It includes duplicate sublists\n- It returns an empty list if no sublists are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=445))
