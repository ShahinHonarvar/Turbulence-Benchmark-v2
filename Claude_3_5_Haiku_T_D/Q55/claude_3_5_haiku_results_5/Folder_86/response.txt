The function takes a circular list as input.\n2. It initializes the target product `n` as -779 and an empty `result` list to store sublists.\n3. It iterates through all possible starting positions in the circular list.\n4. For each starting position, it explores all possible ending positions that wrap around the circular list.\n5. For each start and end combination, it creates a sublist by iterating through the circular list using modulo arithmetic.\n6. It calculates the product of elements in the current sublist.\n7. If the product equals the target product (-779), the sublist is added to the result list.\n8. Finally, it returns the list of all sublists with a product equal to -779.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list indices, ensuring that all possible contiguous sublists are considered.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=382))
