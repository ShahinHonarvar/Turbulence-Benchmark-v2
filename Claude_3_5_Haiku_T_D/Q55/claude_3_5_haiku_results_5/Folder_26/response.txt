The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. We set `n` to 93, which is the target product.\n\n3. We initialize an empty `result` list to store sublists that have a product equal to 93.\n\n4. We calculate the `length` of the input list and create an `extended_list` by duplicating the input list. This helps in handling the circular nature of the list.\n\n5. We use nested loops to generate all possible sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` iterates through all possible starting positions in the original list.\n   - The inner loop `end` generates sublists from each starting position up to the length of the original list.\n\n6. For each sublist, we calculate its product by multiplying all its elements.\n\n7. If the product equals 93, we append the sublist to the `result` list.\n\n8. Finally, we return the `result` list containing all sublists with a product of 93.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by extending the input list and checking all possible contiguous sublists. It captures all sublists with a product of 93, including duplicates, and returns them in no particular order.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=425))
