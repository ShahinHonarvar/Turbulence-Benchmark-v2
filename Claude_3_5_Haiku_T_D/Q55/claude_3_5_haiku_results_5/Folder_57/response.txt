The function takes a circular list of integers as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist.\n\n3. For each possible sublist:\n   - It uses `% n` to wrap around the list indices, creating a circular effect.\n   - It calculates the running product of elements in the sublist.\n   - When the product equals -75, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n\n4. The function returns the list of sublists with a product of -75.\n\n5. If no sublists with a product of -75 are found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list indices, ensuring that sublists can wrap around from the end of the list to the beginning.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=382))
