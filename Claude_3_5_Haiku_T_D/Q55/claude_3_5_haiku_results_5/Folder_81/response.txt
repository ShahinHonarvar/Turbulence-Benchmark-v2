Here's how the function works:\n\n1. It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It iterates through all possible starting points in the list.\n3. For each starting point, it generates sublists by extending the list up to the list's length.\n4. It calculates the product of each sublist.\n5. If the product equals -8, the sublist is added to the result list.\n6. It uses modulo arithmetic (`i % n`) to handle the circular nature of the list.\n7. It returns a list of all sublists with a product of -8.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Each sublist can be of any size up to the list length\n- Duplicates of sublists are included\n- The order of sublists in the result does not matter\n- An empty list is returned if no sublists have a product of -8", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=367))
