Here's how the function works:\n\n1. It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible sublists by varying the start and end indices.\n3. For each possible sublist, it calculates the product of elements.\n4. If the product is exactly 2, the sublist is added to the result list.\n5. If the product exceeds 2, the current sublist generation is stopped.\n6. The function uses modulo arithmetic (`current_index % n`) to handle the circular nature of the list.\n7. If no sublists with a product of 2 are found, an empty list is returned.\n8. Duplicate sublists are allowed in the result.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=410))
