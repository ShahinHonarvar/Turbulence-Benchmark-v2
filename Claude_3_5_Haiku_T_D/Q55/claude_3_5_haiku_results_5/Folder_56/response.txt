The function takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible sublists:\n   - The outer loop iterates through all possible starting points in the circular list.\n   - The inner loop determines the length of each sublist, from 1 to the length of the list.\n\n3. For each starting point and length, it creates a sublist:\n   - Uses modulo arithmetic `(start + i) % n` to wrap around the list and treat it as circular.\n   - Calculates the product of elements in the sublist.\n\n4. If the product of a sublist is exactly -65, it adds that sublist to the result list.\n\n5. The function handles the circular nature of the list by using modulo arithmetic when accessing list elements.\n\n6. It returns all sublists with a product of -65, allowing duplicates and sublists of any length up to the list's size.\n\n7. If no sublists are found with a product of -65, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe implementation ensures that:\n- All possible contiguous sublists are checked\n- The list is treated as circular\n- Sublists can be of any size up to the original list's length\n- Duplicates are included\n- The order of sublists in the result doesn't matter", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=476))
