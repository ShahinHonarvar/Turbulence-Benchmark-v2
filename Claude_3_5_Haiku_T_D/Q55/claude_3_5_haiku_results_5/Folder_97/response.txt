The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists by iterating through different start and end points.\n\n3. For each iteration, it creates a sublist and calculates its product.\n\n4. When the product equals -938, the sublist is added to the result list.\n\n5. The modulo operation `% list_length` ensures that the list is treated as circular, allowing wraparound.\n\n6. If no sublists are found with a product of -938, an empty list is returned.\n\n7. Duplicate sublists are preserved in the result.\n\n8. The function can handle sublists of any size up to the length of the input list.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the input list, as it generates all possible contiguous sublists.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=405))
