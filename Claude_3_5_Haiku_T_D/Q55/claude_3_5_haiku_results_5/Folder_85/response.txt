The function takes a circular list as input.\n2. It generates all possible contiguous sublists by using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list.\n3. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements.\n4. If the product equals -97, the sublist is added to the result list.\n5. The function handles lists of any size and returns all sublists that meet the condition.\n6. If no sublists with a product of -97 are found, an empty list is returned.\n7. Duplicates of sublists are preserved in the result.\n8. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^3), where n is the length of the input list, as it generates all possible sublists and calculates their products.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=349))
