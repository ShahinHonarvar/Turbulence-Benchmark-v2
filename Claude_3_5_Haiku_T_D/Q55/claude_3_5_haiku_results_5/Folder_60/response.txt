The function takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop (`start`) determines the starting index of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop (`length`) determines the length of the sublist.\n\n3. For each potential sublist:\n   - It calculates the product of elements.\n   - Uses modulo arithmetic `(start + i) % n` to handle the circular nature of the list.\n   - If the product equals 49, the sublist is added to the result.\n\n4. The function returns a list of all sublists with a product of 49.\n\nThe implementation ensures that:\n- Sublists can start from any index in the circular list.\n- Sublists can be of any length up to the size of the input list.\n- Duplicate sublists are included in the result.\n- If no sublists with a product of 49 exist, an empty list is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=407))
