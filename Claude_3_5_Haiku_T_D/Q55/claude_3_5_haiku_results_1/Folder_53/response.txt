The function takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It iterates through all possible starting points in the circular list using the `start` variable.\n\n3. For each starting point, it explores all possible ending points using the `end` variable, which can extend beyond the list's length due to the circular nature.\n\n4. It creates a sublist and calculates its product by iterating from the start to the end index, wrapping around the list using the modulo operator `% n`.\n\n5. If the product of the sublist equals -87, the sublist is added to the result list.\n\n6. The function handles the circular nature of the list by using the modulo operator to wrap around the list indices.\n\n7. If no sublists with a product of -87 are found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function allows for sublists of varying lengths and captures all possible sublists that meet the product condition, including duplicates if they exist.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=379))
