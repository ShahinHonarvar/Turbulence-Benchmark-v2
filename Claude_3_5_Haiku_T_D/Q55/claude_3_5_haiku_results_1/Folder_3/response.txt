It takes a circular list `lst` as input.\n\n2. It uses two nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist.\n\n3. For each sublist:\n   - It uses a list comprehension to extract the sublist, taking into account the circular nature of the list by using modulo `% n`.\n   - It calculates the product of the sublist.\n\n4. If the product equals -22, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n\n5. It handles the circular nature of the list by using `(start + i) % n` to wrap around the list.\n\n6. The function returns all sublists with a product of -22, including duplicates if they exist.\n\n7. If no such sublists are found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ³), where n is the length of the input list, as it generates all possible sublists and calculates their products.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=392))
