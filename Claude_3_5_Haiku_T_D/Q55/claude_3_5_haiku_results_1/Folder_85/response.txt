The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It looks for contiguous sublists where the product of elements equals -97.\n3. The function considers the list as circular, so it wraps around using modulo arithmetic.\n4. It checks all possible sublists by varying start and end indices.\n5. When a sublist with a product of -97 is found, it is added to the result list.\n6. If no such sublist exists, an empty list is returned.\n7. Duplicate sublists are allowed in the result.\n8. The order of sublists in the result does not matter.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(nÂ³), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=359))
