It takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It finds all contiguous sublists whose product equals 4.\n3. The function handles the circular nature of the list by using modulo arithmetic (`current_index % n`) to wrap around the list.\n4. Each sublist can be of any size up to the length of the input list.\n5. If no sublist with a product of 4 is found, an empty list is returned.\n6. Duplicate sublists are included in the result.\n7. The order of sublists in the result does not matter.\n\nThe function works by:\n- Using nested loops to generate all possible starting and ending points\n- Creating a sublist and tracking its product\n- Adding sublists with a product of 4 to the result\n- Handling wraparound in the circular list\n- Breaking the inner loop if the product exceeds 4", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=412))
