It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It searches for all possible contiguous sublists with a product of -61.\n3. It handles the circular nature of the list by using modulo arithmetic.\n4. It returns a list of all sublists that satisfy the condition.\n5. If no such sublist exists, it returns an empty list.\n6. It allows for duplicate sublists to be included in the result.\n7. The order of sublists in the returned list is not guaranteed.\n\nThe function works by:\n- Using nested loops to generate all possible start and end points in the circular list\n- Creating a sublist and tracking its product as it extends\n- Checking if the product equals -61 and adding the sublist to the result if it does\n- Continuing to cycle through the list using modulo arithmetic to maintain the circular nature\n\nTime complexity is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=386))
