It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list.\n3. For each potential sublist, it calculates the product by multiplying all elements.\n4. If the product is exactly -3, it adds the sublist to the result.\n5. The modulo operation `% n` ensures that the list wraps around in a circular manner.\n6. It handles lists of any size and returns all sublists that satisfy the condition.\n7. If no sublists are found with a product of -3, it returns an empty list.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ³), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=310))
