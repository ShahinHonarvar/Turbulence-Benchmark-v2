The function takes a circular list as an input.\n2. It generates all possible contiguous sublists by using nested loops.\n3. The modulo operation `i % n` ensures that the list is treated as circular.\n4. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements.\n5. If the product equals -89, the sublist is added to the result list.\n6. The function returns a list of all sublists with a product of -89.\n7. If no such sublists exist, an empty list is returned.\n8. Duplicate sublists are included in the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(nÂ³), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=331))
