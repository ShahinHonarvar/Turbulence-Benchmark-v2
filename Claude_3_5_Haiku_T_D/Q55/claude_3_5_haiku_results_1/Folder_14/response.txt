The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible sublists by iterating through different start and end positions.\n\n3. For each start and end combination, it creates a sublist and calculates its product.\n\n4. It uses modulo arithmetic (`current_index % n`) to simulate a circular list, allowing wrapping around from the end to the beginning.\n\n5. When a sublist with a product of -72 is found, it is added to the `result` list.\n\n6. The function returns the list of all sublists with a product of -72.\n\n7. If no such sublists exist, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe implementation handles circular lists, allows sublists of any size, and captures all possible sublists with a product of -72, including duplicates.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=378))
