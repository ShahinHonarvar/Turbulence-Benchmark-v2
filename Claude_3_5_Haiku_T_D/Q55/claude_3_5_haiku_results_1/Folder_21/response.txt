The function takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list.\n\n3. For each starting point, it creates a sublist and calculates its running product.\n\n4. The modulo operation `% n` is used to wrap around the list, creating the circular behavior.\n\n5. If the product equals 851, the sublist is added to the result list.\n\n6. If the product exceeds 851, the current sublist generation is terminated.\n\n7. The function handles duplicates by adding each matching sublist to the result.\n\n8. If no sublists with a product of 851 are found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the input list, as it generates all possible contiguous sublists.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=396))
