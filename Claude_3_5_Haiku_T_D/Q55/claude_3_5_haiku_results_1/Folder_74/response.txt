The function takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible sublists by iterating through different starting and ending points.\n\n3. For each starting point, it creates a sublist and calculates its product.\n\n4. The `current_index % n` ensures that the list is treated as circular, wrapping around when the index exceeds the list length.\n\n5. If the product of the sublist equals 51, the sublist is added to the result list.\n\n6. If the product exceeds 51, the inner loop breaks and moves to the next starting point.\n\n7. The function returns a list of all sublists with a product of 51.\n\nThe implementation handles circular lists, allows sublists of varying lengths, and includes all possible sublists with a product of 51.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=379))
