The function takes a circular list as input.\n2. It initializes an empty result list to store sublists with the product equal to -81.\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in a circular manner.\n4. For each sublist, it calculates the running product:\n   - If the product equals -81, the sublist is added to the result.\n   - If the product exceeds -81 or the sublist length reaches the original list length, the generation stops.\n5. It uses modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the list.\n6. If no sublists are found with a product of -81, an empty list is returned.\n7. The function allows multiple occurrences of the same sublist in the result.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=387))
