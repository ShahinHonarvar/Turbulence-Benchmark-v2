It takes a circular list of integers `nums` as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list.\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist.\n\n3. For each possible starting and ending point, it creates a sublist by wrapping around the list using modulo `%` operation.\n\n4. While creating the sublist, it calculates the product of its elements.\n\n5. If the product equals -115, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n\n6. The function handles circular list by using `% n` to wrap around indices.\n\n7. It returns all sublists with a product of -115.\n\nThe function will work with lists of any length, including lists with duplicate elements, and will return all sublists that satisfy the product condition.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=359))
