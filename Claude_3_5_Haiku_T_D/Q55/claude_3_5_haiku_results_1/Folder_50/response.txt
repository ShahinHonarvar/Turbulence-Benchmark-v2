The `lists_with_product_equal_n` function takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses two nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting index of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending index of the sublist.\n\n3. For each pair of start and end indices, it creates a sublist using list comprehension. The modulo operator `% n` is used to wrap around the list, making it circular.\n\n4. It calculates the product of the sublist using the `product` helper function.\n\n5. If the product of the sublist is equal to 45, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n\n6. The `product` helper function calculates the product of all elements in a list by multiplying them together.\n\n7. Finally, it returns the list of all sublists with a product of 45.\n\nThe implementation handles circular lists by using the modulo operator to wrap around the list indices, ensuring that all possible contiguous sublists are considered, including those that wrap around from the end to the beginning of the list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=422))
