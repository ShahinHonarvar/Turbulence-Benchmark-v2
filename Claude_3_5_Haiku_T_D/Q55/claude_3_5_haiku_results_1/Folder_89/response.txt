The function takes a circular list of integers as input.\n\n2. It initializes the target product `n` as 57 and gets the length of the input list.\n\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible starting points and ending points in the circular list.\n\n4. For each start and end combination, it creates a sublist and calculates its product.\n\n5. If the product equals 57, the sublist is added to the result list.\n\n6. If the product exceeds 57, the inner loop breaks.\n\n7. The modulo operation `current_index % length` ensures that the list is treated as circular.\n\n8. If no sublists with a product of 57 are found, an empty list is returned.\n\n9. The function handles duplicates by adding all matching sublists to the result.\n\nThe function works with lists of any size and handles the circular nature of the list by using the modulo operator when accessing list elements.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=414))
