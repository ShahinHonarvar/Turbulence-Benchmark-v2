It takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in a circular manner:\n   - The outer loop selects the starting index.\n   - The inner loop selects the ending index.\n\n3. For each possible sublist:\n   - It calculates the sublist by wrapping around the list using modulo arithmetic.\n   - It computes the product of the sublist elements.\n\n4. If the product equals -91 and the sublist is not empty, it adds the sublist to the result.\n\n5. It returns a list of all sublists that have a product of -91.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using modulo arithmetic (`i % n`) to wrap around the list indices, ensuring that sublists can span across the list's end and beginning.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ³), where n is the length of the input list, as it generates all possible contiguous sublists.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=376))
