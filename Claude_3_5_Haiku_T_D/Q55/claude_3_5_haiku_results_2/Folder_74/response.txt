The function takes a circular list as input.\n2. It initializes an empty `result` list to store sublists with a product equal to 51.\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists considering the circular nature of the list.\n4. For each potential starting point, it calculates the product of consecutive elements.\n5. If the product equals 51, it adds the current sublist to the result.\n6. If the product exceeds 51, it breaks the inner loop to avoid unnecessary calculations.\n7. The modulo operation `% length` ensures that the list is treated as circular.\n8. The function returns the list of sublists with a product of 51.\n\nThe function handles various scenarios:\n- Multiple sublists with a product of 51\n- Sublists of different lengths\n- Circular list nature\n- No sublists with a product of 51", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=403))
