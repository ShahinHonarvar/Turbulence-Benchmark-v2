It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists:\n   - The outer loop iterates through all possible starting positions.\n   - The inner loop iterates through all possible sublist lengths.\n3. For each sublist, it:\n   - Calculates the index using modulo operation to handle circular list.\n   - Builds the sublist by taking elements from the circular list.\n   - Calculates the product of the elements.\n4. If the product equals 78, the sublist is added to the result.\n5. It returns a list of all sublists with product 78.\n\nThe function handles all requirements:\n- Works with a circular list\n- Returns sublists of any length\n- Includes all unique sublists with product 78\n- Returns an empty list if no sublists are found\n- Does not require any specific order of sublists in the result", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=371))
