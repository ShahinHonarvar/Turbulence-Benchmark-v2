It takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It generates all possible contiguous sublists by traversing the circular list.\n3. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements.\n4. If the product equals 76, the sublist is added to the result list.\n5. It handles circular list traversal using modulo arithmetic.\n6. It returns an empty list if no sublists with product 76 are found.\n7. It includes duplicate sublists if they exist.\n8. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^3), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=326))
