It takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It finds all sublists with a product equal to -779.\n3. Sublists can be of any size and wrap around the circular list.\n4. If no sublist is found, an empty list is returned.\n5. Duplicate sublists are included in the result.\n6. The order of sublists in the returned list is not guaranteed.\n\nThe function works by:\n- Iterating through all possible starting points in the circular list\n- For each starting point, generating sublists and checking their product\n- Using modulo arithmetic to create the circular list behavior\n- Storing any sublist with a product of -779 in the result list\n- Stopping a sublist generation if the product exceeds -779", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=376))
