The function takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists.\n3. Each sublist's product is calculated by iterating through the circular list.\n4. When the product equals -93, the sublist is added to the result list.\n5. The indices wrap around using the modulo operator to simulate a circular list.\n6. If no sublist with a product of -93 is found, an empty list is returned.\n7. Duplicate sublists are allowed in the result.\n8. The function handles lists of any size.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the input list, as it generates all possible contiguous sublists.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=359))
