The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list.\n3. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements.\n4. If the product equals -95, the sublist is added to the result list.\n5. It handles the circular nature of the list by using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list indices.\n6. Duplicate sublists are included in the result.\n7. If no sublist with a product of -95 is found, an empty list is returned.\n8. The order of sublists in the returned list is not guaranteed.\n\nThe function works by:\n- Iterating through all possible starting points in the list\n- For each starting point, generating all possible sublists by extending to different endpoints\n- Calculating the product of each sublist\n- Storing sublists with a product of -95 in the result list\n- Returning the list of matching sublists", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=391))
