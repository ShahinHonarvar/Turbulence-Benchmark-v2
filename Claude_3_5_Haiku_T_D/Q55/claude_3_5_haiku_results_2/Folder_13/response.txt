The function takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It searches for all possible sublists within the circular list whose product is exactly 54.\n3. It uses modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the list.\n4. It considers all possible start and end positions in the circular list.\n5. Each found sublist with a product of 54 is added to the result list.\n6. If no sublists are found, an empty list is returned.\n7. Duplicate sublists are allowed and will be included in the result.\n8. The order of sublists in the result does not matter.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=340))
