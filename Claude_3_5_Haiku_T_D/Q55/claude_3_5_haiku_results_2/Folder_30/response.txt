It takes a circular list of integers as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the sublists with a product equal to 99.\n3. The function uses nested loops to generate all possible sublists:\n   - The outer loop iterates through possible starting points in the circular list.\n   - The inner loop iterates from the starting point to cover all possible sublist lengths.\n4. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements.\n5. If the product equals 99, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n6. It handles the circular nature of the list by using modulo (`%`) when accessing list elements.\n7. The loop breaks if the product exceeds 99 to optimize performance.\n8. If no sublists with a product of 99 are found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function handles various scenarios like:\n- Sublists of different lengths\n- Circular list structure\n- Multiple sublists with a product of 99\n- Case where no sublists exist with the given product", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=453))
