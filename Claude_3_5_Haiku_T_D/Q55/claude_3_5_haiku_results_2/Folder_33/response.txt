It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It iterates through all possible starting positions in the list.\n3. For each starting position, it generates all possible sublists by considering different ending positions.\n4. It calculates the product of each sublist, taking into account the circular nature of the list by using modulo arithmetic.\n5. If the product of a sublist is exactly -115, it adds that sublist to the result list.\n6. It handles the circular list by using `% n` to wrap around the list indices.\n7. It ensures that sublists can wrap around the end of the list and connect back to the beginning.\n8. If no sublists with a product of -115 are found, it returns an empty list.\n9. If multiple sublists have a product of -115, all of them are included in the result.\n\nThe function satisfies all the requirements specified in the problem statement, including handling circular lists, finding sublists with a product of -115, and allowing sublists of any size up to the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=422))
