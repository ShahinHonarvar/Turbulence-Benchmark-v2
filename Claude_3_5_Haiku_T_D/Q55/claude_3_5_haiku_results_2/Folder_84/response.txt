It takes a circular list as input\n2. It checks for all possible sublists that can be formed from the circular list\n3. It calculates the product of each sublist\n4. If the product equals -906, the sublist is added to the result list\n5. It handles circular list wrapping by using modulo indexing\n6. The function returns an empty list if no sublists with the product are found\n7. It captures all possible sublists, including duplicates\n8. The order of sublists in the returned list is not guaranteed\n\nThe time complexity is O(nÂ³), where n is the length of the input list, as it uses nested loops to generate and check all possible sublists.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=328))
