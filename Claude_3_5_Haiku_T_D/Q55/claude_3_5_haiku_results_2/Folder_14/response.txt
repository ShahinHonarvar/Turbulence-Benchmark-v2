It takes a circular list as input.\n2. It searches for all sublists whose product equals -72.\n3. Each sublist can start at any point in the circular list.\n4. Sublists are contiguous and wrap around if necessary.\n5. If no sublist is found, an empty list is returned.\n6. Duplicate sublists are included.\n7. The order of sublists does not matter.\n\nThe function works by:\n- Iterating through all possible starting points in the list\n- For each starting point, trying to form a sublist that has a product of -72\n- Using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list if needed\n- Stopping the search if the product exceeds -72 or the sublist length equals the list length\n- Storing all found sublists in the result list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=384))
