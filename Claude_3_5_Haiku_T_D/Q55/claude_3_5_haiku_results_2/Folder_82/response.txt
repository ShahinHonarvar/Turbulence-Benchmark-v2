The function takes a list `lst` as input.\n2. It calculates the length of the list `n`.\n3. It initializes an empty `result` list to store sublists with product equal to 8.\n4. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list:\n   - The outer loop `start` represents the starting index.\n   - The inner loop `end` represents the ending index.\n5. It creates a sublist using list comprehension, using modulo `% n` to wrap around the list in a circular manner.\n6. It calculates the product of the sublist.\n7. If the product equals 8, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n8. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing all sublists with product 8.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using the modulo operator to wrap around the list indices, ensuring that sublists can span from the end to the beginning of the list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=364))
