Message(id='msg_01UAKwTJFYyoGk5txZjAHuPU', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    result = []\n    \n    for start in range(n):\n        for end in range(start, start + n):\n            sublist = []\n            product = 1\n            \n            for i in range(start, end + 1):\n                index = i % n\n                sublist.append(lst[index])\n                product *= lst[index]\n            \n            if product == -9:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It takes a circular list `lst` as input.\n\n2. It initializes an empty `result` list to store the sublists that have a product of -9.\n\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting index of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending index of the sublist.\n\n4. For each potential sublist:\n   - It creates an empty `sublist` and initializes the `product` to 1.\n   - It iterates through the elements of the sublist, using modulo `n` to wrap around the circular list.\n   - It appends each element to the `sublist` and multiplies the `product`.\n\n5. If the `product` of the sublist is equal to -9, it adds the `sublist` to the `result`.\n\n6. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing all sublists with a product of -9.\n\nThe function handles the circular nature of the list by using the modulo operator `% n` to wrap around the list indices. This ensures that sublists can span across the end and beginning of the list.\n\nIf no sublists with a product of -9 are found, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(nÂ³), where n is the length of the input list.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=482))
