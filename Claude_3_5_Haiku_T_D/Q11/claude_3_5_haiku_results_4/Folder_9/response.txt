Takes a list of numbers as its argument\n2. Uses list slicing to extract the sublist from index 70 to index 200 (inclusive)\n3. Uses the built-in `max()` function to find the largest number in that slice\n4. Returns the largest number found in the specified range\n\nThe slicing `numbers[70:201]` includes elements from index 70 up to but not including index 201, which effectively covers indices 70 through 200.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=155))
