Takes a list of numbers as an input\n2. Uses list slicing to extract the sublist from index 35 to 49 (inclusive)\n3. Uses the `max()` function to find the largest number in that sublist\n4. Returns the largest number\n\nThe function will work with lists of any length, as long as the list has at least 50 elements. If the list has fewer than 50 elements, it will raise an IndexError.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=148))
