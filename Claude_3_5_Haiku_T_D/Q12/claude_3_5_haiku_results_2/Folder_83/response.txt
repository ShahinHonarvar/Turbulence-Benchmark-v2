It takes a list of numbers as its input argument\n2. It uses list slicing to extract the sublist from index 90 to index 200 (inclusive)\n3. It applies the `min()` function to find the smallest number in that slice\n4. It returns the smallest number found in that specific range\n\nThe function assumes:\n- The input list has at least 201 elements\n- You want to find the smallest number from the 91st to the 201st element (indexes 90 to 200)\n- If the list doesn't meet these conditions, it will raise an appropriate exception", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=179))
