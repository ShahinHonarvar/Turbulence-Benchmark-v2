It takes a single argument `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of numbers\n2. It uses list slicing `numbers[26:75]` to extract the sublist from index 26 to index 74 (inclusive)\n3. The `min()` function is used to find the smallest number in this sublist\n4. The smallest number is then returned\n\nThe function will work with lists of integers or floating-point numbers, and it assumes that the input list has at least 75 elements. If the list is shorter, it will raise an IndexError.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=172))
