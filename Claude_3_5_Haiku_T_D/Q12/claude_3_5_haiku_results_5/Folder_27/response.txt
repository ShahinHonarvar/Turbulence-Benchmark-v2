Takes a list of numbers as its argument\n2. Uses list slicing to extract the sublist from index 62 to index 92 (both inclusive)\n3. Uses the `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in that sublist\n\nNote that `numbers[62:93]` creates a slice that includes indices 62 through 92, which meets the requirement of "from index 62 to index 92, both inclusive".', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=157))
