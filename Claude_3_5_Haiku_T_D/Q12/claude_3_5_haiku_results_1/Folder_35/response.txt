Takes a list of numbers as an input\n2. Uses list slicing from index 43 to 87 (exclusive, which means inclusive of index 86)\n3. Applies the `min()` function to find the smallest number in that slice\n4. Returns the smallest number from that range\n\nThe function will work with any list of numbers that has at least 87 elements. If the list is shorter, it will raise an `IndexError`.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=149))
