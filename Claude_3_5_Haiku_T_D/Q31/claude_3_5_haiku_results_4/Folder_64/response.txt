It defines an inner function `is_perfect` that checks if a number is perfect by:\n   - Returning False if the number is less than or equal to 1\n   - Calculating the sum of its proper divisors (numbers that divide the number evenly, excluding the number itself)\n   - Checking if the sum of divisors equals the original number\n2. It checks if the list has more than 1 element\n3. If it does, it returns the result of `is_perfect` for the number at index 1\n4. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, it returns False\n\nA perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=313))
