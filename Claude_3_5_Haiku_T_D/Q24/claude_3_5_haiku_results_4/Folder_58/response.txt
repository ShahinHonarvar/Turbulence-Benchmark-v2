Message(id='msg_01HaN9o9WhDvrz3rAuquH9gs', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    total = 0\n    for divisor in range(403, 515):\n        if n % divisor == 0:\n            total += divisor\n    return total\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a positive integer `n` as its argument\n2. Initializes a `total` variable to 0 to accumulate the sum of divisors\n3. Iterates through the range from 403 to 514 (inclusive)\n4. Checks if each number in the range is a divisor of `n` using the modulo operator\n5. If a number is a divisor, it is added to the `total`\n6. Returns the final sum of divisors within the specified range\n7. If no divisors are found in the range, it will return 0 by default\n\nThe function covers all the requirements:\n- It finds divisors between 403 and 514 (both inclusive)\n- It sums only the divisors that fall within this range\n- It returns 0 if no divisors are found in the specified range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=130, output_tokens=274))
