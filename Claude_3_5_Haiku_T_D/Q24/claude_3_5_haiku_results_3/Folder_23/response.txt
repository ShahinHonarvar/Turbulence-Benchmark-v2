Message(id='msg_01Jy5Vjg6ZFXMMEugZGetsiJ', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(num):\n    total = 0\n    for divisor in range(18, 53):\n        if num % divisor == 0:\n            total += divisor\n    return total\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a positive integer `num` as its argument\n2. Initializes a `total` variable to 0 to accumulate the sum of divisors\n3. Iterates through the range of numbers from 18 to 52 (inclusive)\n4. Checks if each number in the range is a divisor of `num` by using the modulo operator\n5. If a number is a divisor, it is added to the `total`\n6. Returns the `total` sum of divisors, which will be 0 if no divisors are found in the specified range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=130, output_tokens=214))
