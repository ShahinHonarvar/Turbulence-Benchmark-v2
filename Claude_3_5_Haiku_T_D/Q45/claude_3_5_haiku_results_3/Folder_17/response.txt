Extract only the alphabetic characters from indices 2 to 6 (inclusive) of the input string, converting them to lowercase.\n\n2. Create an empty set `palindromes` to store the unique palindromes.\n\n3. Define a backtracking function `backtrack` that:\n   - Adds the current arrangement to `palindromes` if it's a palindrome of at least length 4\n   - Recursively tries all possible letter arrangements by selecting each letter and creating new arrangements\n\n4. Call the backtracking function with an empty initial string and the extracted letters.\n\n5. Return the set of palindromes found.\n\nThe function works by systematically generating all possible letter arrangements and checking if they form palindromes of at least length 4.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=199, output_tokens=346))
