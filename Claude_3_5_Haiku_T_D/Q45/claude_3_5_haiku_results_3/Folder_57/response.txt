Extract only the alphabetic letters between indices 2 to 5 (inclusive) in lowercase.\n2. Use a recursive backtracking approach to generate all possible arrangements of these letters.\n3. For each arrangement that is at least 5 characters long and has an odd length:\n   - Check if the arrangement is a palindrome\n   - If it is, add it to the set of palindromes\n4. Return the set of unique palindromes.\n\nThe function handles case-insensitivity by converting letters to lowercase during extraction.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=199, output_tokens=298))
