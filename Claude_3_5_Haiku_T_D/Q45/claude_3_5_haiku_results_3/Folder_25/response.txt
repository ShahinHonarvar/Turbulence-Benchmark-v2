Extract the English letters between indices 1 and 4 (inclusive), converting them to lowercase.\n2. Use a backtracking approach to generate all possible palindromes from these letters.\n3. Create a set `palindromes` to store unique palindromes.\n4. The `backtrack` function recursively builds palindrome candidates:\n   - If the current string is a palindrome and at least 3 characters long, add it to the set.\n   - Otherwise, continue generating new permutations by adding letters.\n5. Return the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function handles all requirements, including case-insensitivity and generating palindromes of at least 3 characters long.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=199, output_tokens=317))
