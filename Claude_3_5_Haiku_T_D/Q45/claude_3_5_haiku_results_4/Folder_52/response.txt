Extract only alphabetic characters from the first 8 characters of the input string (0 to 7 inclusive), converting them to lowercase.\n\n2. Use a backtracking approach to generate all possible arrangements of the letters.\n\n3. During backtracking:\n   - If the current arrangement is at least 6 characters long and of even length\n   - Check if the arrangement is a palindrome\n   - If it is a palindrome, add it to the result set\n\n4. Return the set of unique palindromes\n\nThe function handles case-insensitivity by converting letters to lowercase during processing, ensures palindromes are at least 6 characters long, and only considers letters between indices 0 and 7.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=199, output_tokens=332))
