It uses Python's `itertools.combinations()` function to generate all possible subsets of size 64 from the input set.\n2. The `sum()` function with a generator expression counts the number of such subsets.\n3. It works for any input set, regardless of its original size.\n4. If the input set has fewer than 64 elements, it will return 0 as no 64-element subsets can be formed.\n5. It's efficient as it doesn't actually create the subsets, just counts them.\n\nThe function takes advantage of the combination formula that calculates how many ways you can choose 64 elements from a set, which is equivalent to the number of unique 64-element subsets.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=228))
