The function takes a set `s` as an argument, but does not actually use the set in this case, as the number of zero-length subsets is always 1, regardless of the original set's contents.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=120))
