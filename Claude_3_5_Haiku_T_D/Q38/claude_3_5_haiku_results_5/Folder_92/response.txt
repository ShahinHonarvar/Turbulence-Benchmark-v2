Regardless of the input set's size or content, there is exactly one subset of length 0, which is the empty set itself.\n\nThis implementation follows the specification by:\n1. Taking a set of elements as an argument\n2. Returning the number of subsets of length 0\n3. Always returning 1, since the empty set is a subset of any set\n\nThe function will work for any input set, whether it's empty, contains a few elements, or contains many elements.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=180))
