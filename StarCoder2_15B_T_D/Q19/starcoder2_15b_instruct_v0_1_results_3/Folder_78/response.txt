ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code that satisfies the given text specification, you need to understand what the specification means. In this case, the specification asks to write a function called `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all integers in the list that are not divisible by 36.\n\nThe function should only return integers that are not divisible by 36, and the integers should be from index 10 to index 55, both exclusive, of the list that was passed as an argument. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's how you could implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    result = []\n    for num in nums[10:55]:\n        if num % 36!= 0:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function, `all_ints_not_div_by_num`, takes a list of integers as an argument. It then iterates through the list, from index 10 to index 55, and checks if each integer is divisible by 36. If it is not divisible by 36, it adds that integer to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730514567, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=300, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=458))
