The text specification indicates that you need to write a function called `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by 2 from index 1 to index 6, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(ints_list):\n    result = [num for i, num in enumerate(ints_list) if i >= 1 and i < 6 and num % 2!= 0]\n    return result\n```\n\nThe code defines a function called `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes one argument, `ints_list`, which is a list of integers. It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains all integers from `ints_list` that are not divisible by 2 and are located between indices 1 and 6, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730514401, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=274, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=429))
