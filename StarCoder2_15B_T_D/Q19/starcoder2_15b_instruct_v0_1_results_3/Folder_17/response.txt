The list comprehension will iterate over the list, check if the current integer is divisible by 84, and if it is not, it will be added to the resulting list. To restrict the range of integers to consider, we can use slicing to select a sublist from index 39 to index 57, both exclusive.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function 'all_ints_not_div_by_num':\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(lst):\n    return [x for x in lst[39:57] if x % 84!= 0]\n```\n\nThe list comprehension iterates over the sublist from index 39 to index 57, checking if each integer is not divisible by 84. If it is not, it is added to the resulting list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730514180, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=223, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=381))
