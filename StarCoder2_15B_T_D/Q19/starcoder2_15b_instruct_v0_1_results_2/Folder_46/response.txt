Extract the function name and arguments: The function name is 'all_ints_not_div_by_num' and it takes one argument, a list of integers.\n2. Identify the key steps: The key step is to filter the list of integers for those not divisible by 86 from index 18 to index 60.\n3. Generate the Python code: Here's the Python code that implements the function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(ints):\n    return [x for x in ints[18:60] if x % 86!= 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to filter the given list of integers, `ints`, for those not divisible by 86 from index 18 to index 60. The list comprehension iterates through the specified range of the list, `ints[18:60]`, and checks if each integer, `x`, is not divisible by 86 (`x % 86!= 0`). If it is not divisible, it is added to the resulting list.\n\nNote that the specified range is from index 18 to index 60, both exclusive, meaning that the integers at indices 18 and 60 are not included in the filtering.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730513697, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=307, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=465))
