Understand the requirement: The requirement states that you need to write a function called `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all integers not divisible by 26 from index 62 to index 96, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n2. Break down the requirement into smaller steps: You can break down the requirement into the following steps:\n   - Define a function called `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument.\n   - Iterate over the list of integers.\n   - Check if each integer is divisible by 26.\n   - If the integer is not divisible by 26, append it to a new list.\n   - Return the new list containing all integers not divisible by 26.\n   - If no such integers exist in the specified range, return an empty list.\n3. Write the code: You can write the code for the function `all_ints_not_div_by_num` by following the steps outlined above.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code that meets the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    res = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if num % 26!= 0 and 62 <= i < 96:\n            res.append(num)\n    return res\n```\n\nThe code defines a function called `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument. It iterates over the list of integers, checking if each integer is divisible by 26. If the integer is not divisible by 26 and is within the specified range, it is appended to a new list. Finally, the new list is returned, containing all integers not divisible by 26 from index 62 to index 96, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730514078, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=481, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=639))
