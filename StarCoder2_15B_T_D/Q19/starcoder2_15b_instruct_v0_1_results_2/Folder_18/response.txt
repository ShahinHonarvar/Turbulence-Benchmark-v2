Extract the text specification: The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets. We need to extract the text specification from the given instruction by removing the angle brackets.\n2. Create Python code according to the text specification: The text specification states that we need to write a function called `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by 41 from index 35 to index 98, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n3. Generate Python code: To create Python code that meets the specified requirements, we can use a list comprehension to filter the integers in the given list that are not divisible by 41. We can then use slicing to extract the specified range of integers from the filtered list. If the filtered list is empty, we can return an empty list.\n4. Remove comments: The generated Python code should not contain any comments. We can remove any comments from the generated code by using a regular expression to match and remove any comments from the code.\n5. Delimit Python code: The generated Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. We can surround the generated code with triple backticks to delimit it.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(ints):\n    """\n    Returns the list of all integers not divisible by 41 from index 35 to index 98, both exclusive.\n    If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n    """\n    filtered = [i for i in ints if i % 41!= 0]\n    return filtered[35:98] if filtered else []\n```\n\nThe Python code meets the specified requirements by:\n- Using a list comprehension to filter the integers in the given list that are not divisible by 41.\n- Using slicing to extract the specified range of integers from the filtered list.\n- Returning an empty list if the filtered list is empty.\n- Not containing any comments.\n- Being delimited only by triple backticks.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730513551, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=499, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=657))
