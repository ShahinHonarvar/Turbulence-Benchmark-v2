The list comprehension will iterate over the given list and only include the integers that are not divisible by 49 in the resulting list. The slicing operation `[38:81]` will restrict the range of the list to indices 38 to 81, both exclusive.\n\nThe Python code to solve this problem is:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst[38:81] if num % 49!= 0]\n```\n\nThe list comprehension `[num for num in lst[38:81] if num % 49!= 0]` iterates over the given list `lst` and only includes the integers that are not divisible by 49 in the resulting list.
