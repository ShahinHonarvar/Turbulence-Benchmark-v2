Read the text specification carefully to understand what the function should do.\n2. Extract the relevant information from the specification: The function should take a list of integers as an argument, and return the list of all integers not divisible by 93 from index 45 to index 72, both exclusive.\n3. Write the Python code: The function definition should take a single argument, a list of integers. The function should iterate through the list, and for each integer, check if it is divisible by 93. If it is not divisible by 93, the integer should be added to a new list. The function should return the new list.\n4. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited by triple backticks (```) to indicate that it is a code block.\n5. No comments: The Python code should not contain any comments, as per the specification.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(lst):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        if i >= 45 and i < 72 and lst[i] % 93!= 0:\n            result.append(lst[i])\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers as an argument. It iterates through the list, checking if each integer is divisible by 93. If the integer is not divisible by 93, it is added to the result list. The function returns the result list, which contains all integers not divisible by 93 from index 45 to index 72, both exclusive.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730515735, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=387, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=545))
