ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Extract the text specification: Extract the text specification from the given instructions. In this case, the text specification is "a function called \'all_ints_not_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by -46 from index 22 to index 97, both exclusive".\n2. Understand the requirements: Understand the requirements of the problem by parsing the text specification. In this case, the requirement is to write a function named `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all integers not divisible by -46 from index 22 to index 97, both exclusive.\n3. Write the Python code: Write the Python code based on the requirements. In this case, the function should take a list of integers as an argument. The function should traverse the list from index 22 to index 97, and for each integer, check if it is divisible by -46. If it is not divisible, it should be added to the result list. The function should return the result list.\n4. Verify the code: Verify the code by running it on sample inputs. In this case, you can provide sample inputs and compare the output with the expected output.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(22, 97):\n        if nums[i] % -46!= 0:\n            result.append(nums[i])\n    return result\n```\n\nHere is the code verification:\n\n```python\nnums = [i for i in range(100)]\nresult = all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums)\nexpected = [i for i in range(100) if i % 46!= 0]\nassert result == expected\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730515561, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=452, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=610))
