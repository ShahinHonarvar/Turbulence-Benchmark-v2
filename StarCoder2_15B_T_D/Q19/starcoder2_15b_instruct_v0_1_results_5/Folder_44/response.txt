The problem statement indicates that we need to write a function called `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all integers not divisible by 67 from index 46 to index 91, both exclusive.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `all_ints_not_div_by_num` according to the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [n for n in nums[46:91] if n % 67!= 0]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all integers not divisible by 67 from index 46 to index 91, both exclusive. The list comprehension `[n for n in nums[46:91] if n % 67!= 0]` iterates through the elements of the list `nums` from index 46 to index 91, both exclusive, and filters out those that are divisible by 67.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730515603, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=269, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=427))
