It does this by iterating over all integers from 2 to the integer at index 49 and checking if they divide the integer evenly. If they do, they are added to the set of prime factors, and the integer is divided by the factor. This process continues until all prime factors have been identified.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730582551, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=262, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=384))
