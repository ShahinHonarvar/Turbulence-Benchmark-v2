Here's how we can accomplish this:\n\n```python\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n    num = nums[60]\n    prime_factors = set()\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= num:\n        while num % i == 0:\n            prime_factors.add(i)\n            num //= i\n        i += 1\n    if num > 1:\n        prime_factors.add(num)\n\n    return prime_factors\n```\n\nThe function `prime_factors` takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 60. It first finds the integer at index 60 in the list and initializes a set to store the prime factors. It then iterates from 2 to the square root of the integer, and for each number it checks if it is a divisor of the integer. If it is, it adds it to the set and divides the integer by it. If the integer becomes 1, it exits the loop. If the integer is greater than 1 after the loop, it adds it to the set as the last prime factor. Finally, it returns the set of prime factors.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730582947, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=297, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=419))
