If it is, the divisor is added to the `factors` list and the number is divided by the divisor. Otherwise, the divisor is incremented by 1.\n- The function returns the set of prime factors using `set(factors)`.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730583150, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=272, prompt_tokens=123, total_tokens=395))
