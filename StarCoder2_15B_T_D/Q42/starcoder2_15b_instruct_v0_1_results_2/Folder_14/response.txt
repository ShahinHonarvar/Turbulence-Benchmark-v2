It uses a while loop to check if a number is divisible by any prime number. If it is, the prime number is added to the set of factors and the number is divided by the prime number. This continues until the number is no longer divisible by the prime number. The loop continues to check for the next prime number until the number is 1. The function returns the set of prime factors.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730582588, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=182, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=304))
