It then initializes a list to store the prime factors and a variable to keep track of the current divisor. The while loop continues until the number is 1, which means all prime factors have been found.\n\nThe loop checks if the current divisor is a factor of the number using the modulo operator. If it is, the divisor is added to the list of factors and the number is divided by the divisor. Otherwise, the divisor is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.\n\nFinally, the set() function is used to remove duplicate factors and return the set of prime factors.\n\nNote that this implementation is not optimized for performance and may not be suitable for large numbers.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730583301, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=248, prompt_tokens=123, total_tokens=371))
