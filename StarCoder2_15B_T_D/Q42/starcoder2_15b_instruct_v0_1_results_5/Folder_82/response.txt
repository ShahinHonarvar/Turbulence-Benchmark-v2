To determine the prime factors, the function starts by iterating over all numbers from 2 to the number at index 83. For each number, it continuously divides the number by the current factor as long as it doesn't leave a remainder. Once it reaches the end of the loop, it yields the current factor as a prime factor.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730585546, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=168, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=290))
