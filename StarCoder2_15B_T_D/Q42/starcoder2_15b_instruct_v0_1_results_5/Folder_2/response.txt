The function uses a while loop to iterate over the divisors from 2 to the square root of the number. If a divisor divides the number evenly, it is added to the factors list and the number is reduced by that divisor. Otherwise, the divisor is incremented by 1 until the number is reduced to 1. The set of prime factors is returned by converting the factors list into a set.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730584910, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=205, prompt_tokens=123, total_tokens=328))
