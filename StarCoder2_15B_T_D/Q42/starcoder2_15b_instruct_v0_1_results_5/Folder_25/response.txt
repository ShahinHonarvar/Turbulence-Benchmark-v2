It uses a while loop to continuously divide the number by divisors starting from 2 until it reaches 1. If the number is divisible by a divisor, that divisor is added to the list of prime factors and the number is reduced by that divisor. The divisors are incremented until the number becomes 1, at which point the loop terminates. Finally, the list of prime factors is converted to a set to remove any duplicates and returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730585092, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=234, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=356))
