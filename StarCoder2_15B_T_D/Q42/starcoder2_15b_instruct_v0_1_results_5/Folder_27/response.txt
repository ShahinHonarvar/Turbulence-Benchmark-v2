It then finds the prime factors of this number by dividing it by 2 and checking if it's a factor. If it is, it adds the factor to the list of factors and continues dividing the number by the same factor until it's no longer a factor. If not, it increments the factor by 1 and repeats the process. Finally, it returns the set of prime factors of the number.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730585106, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=187, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=309))
