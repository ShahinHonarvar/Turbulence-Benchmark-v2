The algorithm starts with 2 as the smallest prime number, and continues to check if it divides the integer evenly. If it does, it is added to the set of factors, and the integer is divided by the prime number. This process is repeated until the integer is less than or equal to the square root of itself. Finally, if the integer is greater than 1, it is also added to the set of factors. The function returns the set of prime factors of the integer at index 78.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730585468, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=217, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=339))
