It uses a loop to divide the number by each possible factor starting from 2, and adds the factor to the set of factors when it divides evenly. The loop continues until the number is equal to 1, indicating that all factors have been found.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730583923, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=170, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=292))
