It uses a while loop to iterate over all possible factors of the integer. If a factor is found, it is added to the `prime_factors` list and the integer is divided by the factor. The loop continues until all factors are found. Finally, the `prime_factors` list is converted into a set to remove any duplicates and the set is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730583612, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=241, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=363))
