It uses a while loop to iteratively check if the integer is divisible by each number starting from 2. If it is divisible, the factor is added to the list of factors and the integer is divided by the factor. This process continues until the integer is equal to 1. Finally, the list of factors is converted into a set to remove any duplicates and the set is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730583333, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=193, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=315))
