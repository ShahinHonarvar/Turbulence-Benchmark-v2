Define a function named `prime_factors` with one argument, `nums`, which is a list of positive integers.\n2. Inside the function, retrieve the integer at index 88 from the list using `nums[88]`.\n3. Initialize an empty set called `factors` to store the prime factors of the integer.\n4. Use a loop to iterate over the range from 2 to the square root of the integer, and check whether each number is a divisor of the integer.\n5. If a number is a divisor, add it to the `factors` set. Additionally, check whether the quotient of the integer divided by the divisor is a prime number. If it is, add it to the `factors` set as well.\n6. Return the `factors` set at the end of the function.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements this solution:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n    num = nums[88]\n    factors = set()\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            factors.add(i)\n            quotient = num // i\n            is_prime = True\n            for j in range(2, int(math.sqrt(quotient)) + 1):\n                if quotient % j == 0:\n                    is_prime = False\n                    break\n            if is_prime:\n                factors.add(quotient)\n    return factors\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 88. It iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of the integer and checks whether each number is a divisor. If a number is a divisor, it adds it to the `factors` set. Additionally, it checks whether the quotient of the integer divided by the divisor is a prime number. If it is, it adds it to the `factors` set as well. Finally, it returns the `factors` set.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730583823, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=483, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=605))
