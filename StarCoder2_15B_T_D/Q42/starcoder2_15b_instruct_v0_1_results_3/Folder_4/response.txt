Then, we use a while loop to find all prime factors of that number. We start with 2 as the first prime factor, and incrementally check whether it divides the number. If it does, we add it to the list of factors and continue the process with the resulting quotient. Otherwise, we move on to the next number. Finally, we return the set of prime factors.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730583371, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=184, prompt_tokens=122, total_tokens=306))
