The algorithm starts by initializing the set of prime factors and the initial factor to be checked as 2. It then iterates through the factors until the square of the factor is greater than or equal to the number to check. For each factor, it checks if the number is divisible by the factor. If it is, it adds the factor to the set of prime factors and updates the number to check by dividing it by the factor. If the number is not divisible by the factor, it increments the factor by 1. Finally, it adds the last number to the set of prime factors and returns it.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730583391, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=265, prompt_tokens=123, total_tokens=388))
