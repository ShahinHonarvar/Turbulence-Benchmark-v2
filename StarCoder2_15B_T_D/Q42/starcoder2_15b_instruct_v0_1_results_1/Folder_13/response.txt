Then, we use a while loop to find the prime factors of that number. The while loop continues as long as the square of the current factor is less than or equal to the number. Within the loop, we check if the current factor is a factor of the number using the modulo operator. If it is, we add it to the list of prime factors, and then divide the number by the factor. After the loop, we check if the number is greater than 1, which means it has at least one prime factor that is greater than its square root. If so, we add it to the list of prime factors. Finally, we return the set of unique prime factors using the set() function.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730581789, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=276, prompt_tokens=123, total_tokens=399))
