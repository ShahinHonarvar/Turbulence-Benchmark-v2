Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[773, 429, 264, 521, 413, 799, 310, 486, 595, 926, 515, 288, 771, 631, 256, 928, 1002, 826, 920, 317, 744, 916, 697, 482, 103, 443, 623, 931, 985, 487, 882, 266, 821, 560, 15, 734, 407, 841, 681, 2, 503, 885, 249, 332, 888, 195, 579, 244, 986, 819, 457, 82, 327, 518, 951]


The correct answer was:

7

But the LLM code returned:
1
