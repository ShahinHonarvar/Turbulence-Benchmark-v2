Extract the text specification: Identify the text specification surrounded by angle brackets. In this case, it\'s "Write a function called \'gcf_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 47 and 22."\n2. Translate the text specification into Python code: Map the text specification to Python syntax and constructs. The function name and description suggest it should be a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 47 and 22.\n3. Write the Python code: Translate the text specification into Python code without using comments or triple backticks. The code should be concise and efficient.\n4. Delimit the Python code: Use triple backticks to delimit the Python code.\n\nHere\'s how you can create Python code based on the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    return nums[47] * nums[22]\n```\n\nThe code extracts the text specification from the angle brackets, translates it into Python code, and writes it without using comments or triple backticks. The Python code is delimited by triple backticks.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730544298, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=297, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=424))
