The Euclidean algorithm is a simple and efficient method to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n\n1. Identify the Problem\n    - Write a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 48 and 76.\n2. Understand the Input\n    - The input is a list of positive integers.\n3. Understand the Output\n    - The output is the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 48 and 76.\n4. Understand the Requirements\n    - The function should not contain any comments.\n    - The function should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n5. Design the Solution\n    - We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common factor of two numbers. The Euclidean algorithm is a simple and efficient method to calculate the GCD of two numbers.\n6. Implement the Solution in Python\n    - Here's how we can implement the Euclidean algorithm in Python:\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    a = nums[48]\n    b = nums[76]\n    while b!= 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is a simple and efficient method to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and taking the remainder as the new dividend. This process continues until the remainder becomes zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the GCD of the two numbers.\n\nThe implementation of the Euclidean algorithm in Python is shown in the code snippet. The function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 48 and 76.
