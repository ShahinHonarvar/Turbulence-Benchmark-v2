Define the function `gcf_two_nums` with one parameter, `nums`, which is a list of positive integers.\n2. Find the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 28 and 17 in the list `nums`.\n3. Return the greatest common factor.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    num1 = nums[28]\n    num2 = nums[17]\n    if num1 > num2:\n        smaller = num2\n    else:\n        smaller = num1\n    for i in range(1, smaller + 1):\n        if num1 % i == 0 and num2 % i == 0:\n            gcf = i\n\n    return gcf\n```\n\nThis implementation defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 28 and 17. It finds the greatest common factor by looping through all the numbers from 1 to the smaller of the two numbers and checking if they divide both numbers evenly.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730541845, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=298, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=425))
