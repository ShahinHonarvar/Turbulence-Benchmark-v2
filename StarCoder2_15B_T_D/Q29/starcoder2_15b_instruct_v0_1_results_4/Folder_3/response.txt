Extract the relevant information from the text specification. In this case, the function name is 'gcf_two_nums' and the argument is a list of positive integers.\n2. Write the Python function signature. In this case, the signature is `def gcf_two_nums(nums):`.\n3. Extract the indices 47 and 10 from the list of positive integers. You can use `nums[47]` and `nums[10]` to access the elements at those indices.\n4. Write the code to find the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 47 and 10. You can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCF of two numbers.\n5. Delimit the Python code using triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    a = nums[47]\n    b = nums[10]\n    while b!= 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 47 and 10.
