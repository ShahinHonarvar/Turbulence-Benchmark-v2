It then finds the smaller of the two numbers and iterates from 1 to the smaller number, checking if each number is a factor of both integers. The first number that meets this condition is the greatest common factor.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730543652, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=236, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=365))
