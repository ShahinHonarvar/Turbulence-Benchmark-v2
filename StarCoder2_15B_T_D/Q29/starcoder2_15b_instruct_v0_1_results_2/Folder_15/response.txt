It first checks that the input is a list of at least two positive integers, and then uses a helper function `gcf` to calculate the GCF of the first two integers. The `gcf` function implements the Euclidean algorithm, which recursively calculates the GCF of two numbers by dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. When the remainder is zero, the previous number is the GCF of the two numbers.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730542307, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=267, prompt_tokens=125, total_tokens=392))
