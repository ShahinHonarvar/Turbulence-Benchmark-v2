We can do this by using the Euclidean algorithm, which states that the GCF of two numbers is the same as the GCF of the smaller number and the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number. We can then apply this algorithm recursively until the remainder is zero.\n\nHere is the implementation of the 'gcf_two_nums' function using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    a = nums[90]\n    b = nums[54]\n    if a < b:\n        a, b = b, a\n    while b!= 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730542534, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=166, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=293))
