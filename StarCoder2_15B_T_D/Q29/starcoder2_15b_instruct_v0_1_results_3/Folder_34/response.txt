This algorithm is based on the fact that the GCF of two numbers is the same as the GCF of the smaller number and the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number. We can implement this algorithm recursively, dividing the larger number by the smaller number and repeating the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.\n\nHere's how we can implement the Euclidean algorithm in Python:\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    num1 = nums[60]\n    num2 = nums[64]\n    def gcf(a, b):\n        if a > b:\n            return gcf(a - b, b)\n        elif a < b:\n            return gcf(a, b - a)\n        else:\n            return a\n    return gcf(num1, num2)\n```\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is a efficient and effective way to calculate the GCF of two numbers.
