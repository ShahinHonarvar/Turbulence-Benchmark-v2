We can apply this algorithm repeatedly until the remainder is zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the greatest common factor.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement the function `gcf_two_nums`:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    num1 = nums[28]\n    num2 = nums[67]\n    if num1 < num2:\n        smaller = num1\n        larger = num2\n    else:\n        smaller = num2\n        larger = num1\n    remainder = larger % smaller\n    while remainder!= 0:\n        larger = smaller\n        smaller = remainder\n        remainder = larger % smaller\n    return smaller\n```\n\nThe function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 28 and 67. The Euclidean algorithm is used to find the greatest common factor of two numbers. The function first determines the smaller and larger numbers, then repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common factor.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730543174, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=338, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=465))
