The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    a = nums[83]\n    b = nums[14]\n    while b!= 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is based on the fact that the greatest common divisor of two numbers is the same as the greatest common divisor of the smaller number and the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number. The algorithm repeats this process until the remainder is zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730543344, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=178, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=305))
