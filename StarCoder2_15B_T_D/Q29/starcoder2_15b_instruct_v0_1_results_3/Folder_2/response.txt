Define a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes a single argument, `nums`, which is a list of positive integers.\n2. Extract the integers at indices 372 and 752 from the list using `nums[372]` and `nums[752]`.\n3. Calculate the GCF of the two integers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is implemented in the `math.gcd` function in Python.\n4. Return the calculated GCF as the result of the function.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    num1 = nums[372]\n    num2 = nums[752]\n    gcf = math.gcd(num1, num2)\n    return gcf\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of positive integers as an argument and extracts the integers at indices 372 and 752. It then uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCF of these two integers. Finally, it returns the calculated GCF as the result of the function.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730542843, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=285, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=414))
