Understand the specification: Understand the problem description and the desired output. In this case, write a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 84 and 63.\n2. Break down the problem: Break down the problem into smaller parts or steps that are easier to implement. In this case, you can write a function to find the greatest common factor of two numbers and then call it with the appropriate indices.\n3. Implement the solution: Implement the solution using Python code, without using any comments or other unnecessary elements. In this case, you can use the `gcd` function from the `math` module to find the greatest common factor of two numbers and then call it with the appropriate indices.\n4. Delimit the code: Delimit the code using triple backticks to indicate the start and end of the Python code.\n\nHere's how you can write Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    return gcd(nums[84], nums[63])\n```\n\nThis code will find the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 84 and 63 in the list of positive integers provided as an argument to the `gcf_two_nums` function.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730542885, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=308, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=435))
