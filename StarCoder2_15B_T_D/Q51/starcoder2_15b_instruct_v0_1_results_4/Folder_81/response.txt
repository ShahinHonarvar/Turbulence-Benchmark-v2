ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To accomplish the task, you can use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort each string in the list alphabetically, and then use `collections.Counter()` to count the occurrences of each sorted string. You can then iterate through the list of sorted strings and count the occurrences of each string. Finally, you can check if there are any pairs of anagrams in the list that satisfy the given conditions and return the appropriate boolean value.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef if_contains_anagrams(string_list):\n    sorted_strings = [sorted(s.lower()) for s in string_list]\n    counter = collections.Counter(tuple(s) for s in sorted_strings)\n    for string, count in counter.items():\n        if len(string) >= 3 and count > 79:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of strings as input and returns `True` if there are at most 79 pairs of anagrams in the list that satisfy the given conditions. The function first sorts each string alphabetically using `sorted()` and `lower()`. It then uses `collections.Counter()` to count the occurrences of each sorted string. The function iterates through the list of sorted strings and counts the occurrences of each string. If the length of a string is at least three and the count is greater than 79, the function returns `False`, indicating that there are more than 79 pairs of anagrams in the list. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that there are at most 79 pairs of anagrams in the list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730630768, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=349, prompt_tokens=179, total_tokens=528))
