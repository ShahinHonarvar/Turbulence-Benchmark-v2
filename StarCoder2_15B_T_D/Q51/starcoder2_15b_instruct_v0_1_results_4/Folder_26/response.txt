We will iterate over the words in the list and check if they are anagrams of each other. If they are, we will add them to the dictionary as a pair. Finally, we will check if there are at most 35 pairs of anagrams in the dictionary and return the appropriate boolean value.\n\nHere is the code for the `if_contains_anagrams` function:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = {}\n    for word in words:\n        key = tuple(sorted(word.lower()))\n        if key in anagrams:\n            anagrams[key].append(word)\n        else:\n            anagrams[key] = [word]\n    return len(anagrams) <= 35\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a dictionary called `anagrams` to store the anagrams of the English letters.
