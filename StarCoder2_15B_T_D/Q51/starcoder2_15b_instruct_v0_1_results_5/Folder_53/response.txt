If it\'s not, it creates a new entry with the canonical form as the key and the original string as the value. If it is present, it adds the original string to the existing list of strings associated with that canonical form.\n- Finally, it checks if there are at most 8 pairs of anagrams in the list by checking if the length of the list of strings associated with each canonical form is greater than 1 and counting the number of pairs.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730632071, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=299, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=477))
