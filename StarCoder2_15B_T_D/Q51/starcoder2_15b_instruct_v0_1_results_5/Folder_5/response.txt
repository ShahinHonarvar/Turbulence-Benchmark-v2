ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create the Python code according to the text specification, we need to understand what the text specification requires. The text specification states that we need to create a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns `True` if there are at most 4 pairs of anagrams in the list; otherwise, it should return `False`. The function should only consider anagrams that are the English letters, and it should only consider anagrams that are of length at least 3. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the requirements specified by the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(strings):\n    anagrams = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        key = "".join(sorted(s.lower()))\n        if len(key) >= 3 and key.isalpha():\n            anagrams[key] = anagrams.get(key, 0) + 1\n    return max(anagrams.values(), default=0) <= 4\n```\n\nThe function `if_contains_anagrams` takes a list of strings as an argument and returns `True` if there are at most 4 pairs of anagrams in the list; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function only considers anagrams that are the English letters and are of length at least 3. The function compares the strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nThe function first creates an empty dictionary to store the anagrams. Then, it iterates through each string in the list of strings and creates a key by sorting the letters in the string and converting it to lower case. If the key is at least 3 letters long and contains only English letters, it adds it to the dictionary with a value of 1. If the key already exists in the dictionary, it increments the value by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns `True` if the maximum value in the dictionary is less than or equal to 4, indicating that there are at most 4 pairs of anagrams in the list. Otherwise, it returns `False`.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730631194, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=455, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=633))
