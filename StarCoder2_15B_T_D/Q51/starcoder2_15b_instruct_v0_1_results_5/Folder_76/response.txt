Each key in the dictionary is the sorted version of a word, and the corresponding value is a list of words that are anagrams of the key.\n\nThen, it iterates through the list of words and adds them to the dictionary. If a word is not an anagram (i.e., it is not of length at least three or it contains non-English letters), it is ignored. Otherwise, it is added to the dictionary by sorting the word and using the sorted version as the key.\n\nFinally, it counts the number of anagram pairs by iterating through the values of the dictionary and using the formula `n * (n - 1) / 2` to count the number of pairs for each group. If the total number of pairs is less than or equal to 91, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730632750, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=443, prompt_tokens=179, total_tokens=622))
