To do this, we'll need to consider the following:\n\n1. Anagrams: We need to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other. To do this, we'll first convert both strings to lowercase and remove any non-alphabetic characters. Then, we'll sort the letters in each string and compare them. If they match, we can conclude that the strings are anagrams.\n2. Number of pairs: We need to keep track of the number of pairs of anagrams in the list. We'll use a dictionary to store the anagrams and their frequencies.\n3. Maximum of 8 pairs: We need to check if there are at most 8 pairs of anagrams in the list. If there are more than 8 pairs, we'll return `False`.\n4. Length of at least 3: We need to consider the anagrams of the length of at least 3. We'll filter out the strings that don't meet this requirement.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(strings):\n    def is_anagram(s1, s2):\n        s1 = ''.join(c for c in s1.lower() if c.isalpha())\n        s2 = ''.join(c for c in s2.lower() if c.isalpha())\n        return sorted(s1) == sorted(s2)\n\n    anagrams = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) >= 3:\n            for s2 in strings:\n                if is_anagram(s, s2):\n                    anagrams[s] = anagrams.get(s, 0) + 1\n\n    return max(anagrams.values(), default=0) <= 8\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we define a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a list of strings as an argument. We also define a helper function `is_anagram` that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.\n\nIn the `if_contains_anagrams` function, we first filter out the strings that are less than 3 characters long. Then, we iterate over the list and check if each string is an anagram of any other string. If so, we increment the frequency of that string in the `anagrams` dictionary.\n\nFinally, we check if the maximum frequency of any string in the `anagrams` dictionary is less than or equal to 8. If so, we return `True`, otherwise `False`.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730624406, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=586, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=764))
