ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the specification, you need to create a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a list of strings as an argument. The function should return `True` if there are at most 28 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\nTo determine if there are at most 28 pairs of anagrams, you can use the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each string in the list. Then, you can iterate through the frequencies and check if any of them are greater than 1. If there are more than 28 pairs of anagrams, the function should return `False`.\n\nTo consider the anagrams of the English letters, you can use the `collections.Counter` class again to count the frequency of each letter in each string. Then, you can compare the frequencies of each letter between two strings to determine if they are anagrams.\n\nTo consider the anagrams of the length of at least three, you can filter the list of strings to only include those with a length of at least three before counting the frequencies.\n\nTo compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner, you can convert all strings to lowercase before comparing them.\n\nHere\'s how you can create a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that meets the specification:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef if_contains_anagrams(strings):\n    anagram_freq = Counter()\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) >= 3:\n            anagram_freq.update(["".join(sorted(s.lower()))])\n    return len([freq for freq in anagram_freq.values() if freq > 1]) <= 28\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730626838, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=375, prompt_tokens=179, total_tokens=554))
