Extract the Python code from the text specification: The text specification contains the Python code surrounded by triple backticks. You can use a regular expression to extract the Python code from the text specification.\n2. Remove comments from the Python code: The Python code may contain comments that should be removed. You can use a regular expression to match and remove comments from the Python code.\n3. Create a Python function: The text specification describes a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return `true` if there are at most 21 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return `false`.\n4. Consider only the anagrams of the English letters: The text specification describes that the function should only consider the anagrams of the English letters. You can use a regular expression to match only the anagrams of the English letters.\n5. Consider only the anagrams of the length of at least three: The text specification describes that the function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. You can use a regular expression to match only the anagrams of the length of at least three.\n6. Compare strings in a case-insensitive manner: The text specification describes that the function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner. You can use the `lower()` method to convert the strings to lowercase before comparing them.\n\nHere's an example of how you can create the Python code based on the text specification:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef if_contains_anagrams(strings):\n    anagrams = {}\n    for string in strings:\n        string = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]+', '', string).lower()\n        if len(string) >= 3:\n            anagram_key = ''.join(sorted(string))\n            anagrams[anagram_key] = anagrams.get(anagram_key, 0) + 1\n\n    return len(anagrams) <= 21\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730626280, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=453, prompt_tokens=179, total_tokens=632))
