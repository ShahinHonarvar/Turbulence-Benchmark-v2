ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='The instruction asks you to write a Python function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns `True` if there are at most 5 pairs of anagrams in the list, otherwise returns `False`. An anagram is a word or phrase that is formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, such as "cinema" and "iceman". The function should only consider the anagrams of the English letters, and the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef if_contains_anagrams(words: List[str]) -> bool:\n    """\n    Checks if the list of words contains at most 5 pairs of anagrams. An anagram is a\n    word or phrase that is formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.\n    The function should only consider the anagrams of the English letters, and the anagrams\n    of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a\n    case-insensitive manner.\n    """\n    anagrams = {}\n    for word in words:\n        word = word.lower()\n        key = "".join(sorted(word))\n        if key in anagrams:\n            anagrams[key].append(word)\n        else:\n            anagrams[key] = [word]\n    num_anagrams = 0\n    for key in anagrams:\n        if len(anagrams[key]) >= 3:\n            num_anagrams += len(anagrams[key]) - 2\n    return num_anagrams <= 5\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730627876, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=366, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=544))
