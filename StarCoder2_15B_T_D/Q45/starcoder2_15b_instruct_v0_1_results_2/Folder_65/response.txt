Extract the text between the angle brackets and remove any comments.\n2. Extract the function name, \'palindromes_between_indices\'.\n3. Extract the function arguments, which is a string.\n4. Extract the function return type, which is a set of strings.\n5. Extract the function body, which states that the function should return the set of all palindromes of length at least 5 that can be created from any possible arrangement of English letters in the given string that occur between indices 0 and 6, both inclusive.\n6. Create a function definition in Python using the extracted information.\n7. Implement the function body in Python that meets the given specification.\n8.
