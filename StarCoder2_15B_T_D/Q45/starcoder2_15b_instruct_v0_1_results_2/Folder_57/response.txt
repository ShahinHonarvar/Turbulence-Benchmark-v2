Parse the text specification: Understand the problem and identify the key components that need to be implemented.\n2. Break down the problem: Break down the problem into smaller components or steps that can be implemented individually.\n3. Plan the solution: Define the data structures, algorithms, and functions that will be required to solve the problem.\n4. Write the code: Translate the problem solution into Python code.\n5. Test the code: Validate the correctness of the code by running tests or using a code linter.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    def is_palindrome(s):\n        return s == s[::-1]\n\n    letters = [c for c in string.lower() if c.isalpha()]\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(letters) - 4):\n        for j in range(i + 4, len(letters)):\n            palindromes.add(''.join(letters[i:j + 1]))\n\n    return {p for p in palindromes if is_palindrome(p) and len(p) >= 5}\n```\n\nThis function parses the given string to extract the English letters between indices 2 and 5, both inclusive. It then generates all possible palindromes of length at least 5 by considering all possible combinations of these letters. Finally, it filters out the palindromes that are not at least 5 characters long.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730596057, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=341, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=562))
