Understand the problem: The problem requires us to find palindromes of length at least 4 from a given string that occur between indices 4 to 8, both inclusive.\n2. Break down the problem into sub-problems: We can break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, such as finding palindromes of length at least 4 from a given string and finding palindromes that occur between indices 4 to 8, both inclusive.\n3. Solve the sub-problems: We can solve each sub-problem separately and combine the solutions to form the final solution.\n4. Write the code: We can write the code in Python to solve each sub-problem and combine the solutions to form the final solution.\n5. Test the code: We can test the code by providing different inputs and verifying that the output is correct.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    letters = [letter for letter in string if letter.isalpha()]\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(4, len(letters) - 3):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(letters) + 1):\n            palindrome = ''.join(letters[i:j])\n            if palindrome == palindrome[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(palindrome)\n    return palindromes\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730595571, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=324, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=545))
