Converts all letters in the string to lower case and filters out any non-letter characters.\n2. Iterates over all substrings of length 5 or more that can be formed from the filtered letters.\n3. For each substring, checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version.\n4. If the substring is a palindrome, adds it to the set of palindromes.\n5. Returns the set of all palindromes found.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730595201, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=332, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=553))
