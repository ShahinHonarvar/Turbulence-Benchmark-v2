Then, you can use a recursive function to generate all possible arrangements of the letters. Finally, you can filter out the palindromes of the required length and convert them to a set.\n\nHere\'s how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    letters = re.findall(r\'[a-z]\', string.lower())[5:10]\n\n    def arrangements(letters, arrangement=[]):\n        if len(letters) == 0:\n            return [arrangement]\n        else:\n            return [arrangement + [letter] + a for letter in letters for a in arrangements(letters[:] - {letter})]\n\n    arranged_letters = arrangements(set(letters))\n    palindromes = {"".join(arrangement) for arrangement in arranged_letters if len(arrangement) >= 5 and arrangement == arrangement[::-1]}\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe `re.findall(r\'[a-z]\', string.lower())` expression extracts all lowercase English letters from the given string. The `[5:10]` slice selects the letters between indices 5 and 9, both inclusive.\n\nThe `arrangements` function uses a recursive approach to generate all possible arrangements of the letters. The function takes in a set of letters and an optional arrangement parameter, which is initially empty. If there are no more letters to arrange, it returns the current arrangement. Otherwise, it uses a generator expression to generate all possible arrangements by adding each letter from the set to the current arrangement and recursively calling `arrangements` with the remaining letters.\n\nThe `palindromes` set comprehension filters out the palindromes of the required length from the arranged letters. The `arrangement == arrangement[::-1]` condition checks if the arrangement is the same as its reversed self.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730595094, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=438, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=659))
