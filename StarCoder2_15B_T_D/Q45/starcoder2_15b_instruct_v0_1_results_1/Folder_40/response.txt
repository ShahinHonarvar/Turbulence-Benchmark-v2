Extract the text between the angle brackets: Use regular expressions to extract the text between the angle brackets.\n2. Convert the text to Python code: Convert the text to Python code by replacing specific words with their equivalent Python syntax.\n3. Generate the palindromes: Generate all possible palindromes of length at least 7 from the English letters in the given string that occur between indices 4 and 9, both inclusive.\n4. Form the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner: Form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner by converting all letters to lowercase before checking for palindromes.\n5. Return the set of palindromes: Return the set of all generated palindromes as the output of the function.\n6. Delimit the Python code with triple backticks: Delimit the Python code with triple backticks to indicate the start and end of the code block.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the above steps:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    """\n    Generate all possible palindromes of length at least 7 from the English letters in the given\n    string that occur between indices 4 and 9, both inclusive.\n    """\n    text = re.search(r\'<(.*?)>\', string).group(1)\n    code = text.replace(\'a function\', \'def\').replace(\'that\',\'return\').replace(\'a string\',\'str\')\n    letters = [letter.lower() for letter in string if letter.isalpha() and 4 <= string.index(letter) <= 9]\n    palindromes = {word for word in (\'\'.join(letters[i:j]) for i in range(len(letters)) for j in range(i, len(letters))) if len(word) >= 7 and word == word[::-1]}\n    \n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe code extracts the text between the angle brackets, converts it to Python code, generates all possible palindromes of length at least 7 from the English letters in the given string that occur between indices 4 and 9, both inclusive, and returns the set of palindromes as the output of the function.
