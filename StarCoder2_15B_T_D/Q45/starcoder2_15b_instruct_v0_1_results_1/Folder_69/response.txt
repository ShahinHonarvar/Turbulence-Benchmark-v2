Extract the text specification.\n2. Parse the text specification to extract the required information.\n3. Generate all possible arrangements of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 0 to index 3, both inclusive.\n4. Filter out the palindromes of the length of at least 4 from the generated arrangements.\n5. Form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.\n6. Return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 4 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 0 to index 3, both inclusive.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the above steps:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport itertools\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    text_specification = re.search(r"\\s*(\\S+)\\s*", string).group(1)\n    required_length = int(re.search(r"\\s*(\\d+)\\s*", text_specification).group(1))\n    letters = list(set(re.findall(r"[a-z]", string.lower())))\n    arrangements = itertools.permutations(letters, 4)\n    palindromes = set(letter_arrangement for letter_arrangement in arrangements if len(letter_arrangement) >= required_length and letter_arrangement == "".join(reversed(letter_arrangement)))\n    return palindromes\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730595239, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=329, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=550))
