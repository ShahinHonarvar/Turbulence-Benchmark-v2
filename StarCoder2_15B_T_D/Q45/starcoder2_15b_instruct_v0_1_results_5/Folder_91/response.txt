Filter the characters of the string that fall within the specified range (2 to 6, both inclusive).\n2. Find all possible permutations of the filtered characters.\n3. Create palindromes from each permutation by joining the characters in reverse order to the characters in their original order.\n4. Filter the palindromes to keep only those of length at least 3.\n5. Convert the remaining palindromes to lowercase to form them in a case-insensitive manner.\n6. Return the resulting set of palindromes.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    filtered_chars = [char for char in string if 2 <= string.index(char) <= 6]\n    permutations = set()\n    def find_permutations(chars, permutation):\n        if len(chars) == 0:\n            permutations.add(''.join(permutation))\n        else:\n            for i in range(len(chars)):\n                find_permutations(chars[:i] + chars[i+1:], permutation + [chars[i]])\n    find_permutations(filtered_chars, [])\n    palindromes = set()\n    for permutation in permutations:\n        palindromes.add(permutation + ''.join(reversed(permutation)))\n    palindromes = {palindrome for palindrome in palindromes if len(palindrome) >= 3}\n    return set(palindrome.lower() for palindrome in palindromes)\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as input and returns a set of palindromes formed from any arrangement of English letters in the string that occur between indices 2 and 6, both inclusive. It finds all possible permutations of the filtered characters, creates palindromes from each permutation, filters the palindromes to keep only those of length at least 3, converts them to lowercase, and returns the resulting set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730599489, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=461, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=682))
