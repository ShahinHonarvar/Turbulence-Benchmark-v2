Convert the string to lowercase and remove any non-alphabetical characters.\n2. Iterate over each substring of length 3 from index 4 to the second-last index of the string.\n3. For each such substring, check if it is a palindrome.\n4. If it is a palindrome, add it to the set of palindromes.\n5. Return the set of palindromes.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    string = ''.join([c for c in string.lower() if c.isalpha()])\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(4, len(string) - 2):\n        substring = string[i:i+3]\n        if substring == substring[::-1]:\n            palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis implementation converts the given string to lowercase and removes any non-alphabetical characters. It then iterates over each substring of length 3 from index 4 to the second-last index of the string. For each such substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. If it is a palindrome, it adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730599595, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=363, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=584))
