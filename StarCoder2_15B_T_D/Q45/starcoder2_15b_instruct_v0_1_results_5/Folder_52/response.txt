It then creates a set to store the palindromes. Next, it iterates through all possible windows of length 6 to 7 in the string. For each window, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version. If it is a palindrome, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the set of palindromes is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730599142, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=210, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=431))
