The Python code should not contain any comments, and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the given text specification:\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    letters = [c for c in string if c.isalpha()]\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(2, 10):\n        for j in range(i + 1, 10):\n            for permutation in itertools.permutations(letters, j - i + 1):\n                palindrome = ''.join(permutation).lower()\n                if palindrome == palindrome[::-1] and len(palindrome) >= 6:\n                    palindromes.add(palindrome)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of the length of at least 6 that can be formed from the English letters in the given string that occur between indices 2 and 9, both inclusive. It does this by first converting the given string into a list of letters, and then iterating over all possible combinations of these letters between indices 2 and 9. For each combination, it creates a palindrome by joining the letters together, and then checks if it is a palindrome and has a length of at least 6. If so, it adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730598893, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=339, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=560))
