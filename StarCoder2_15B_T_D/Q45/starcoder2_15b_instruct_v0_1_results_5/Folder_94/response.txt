The function should be called `palindromes_between_indices`.\n2. The function should take one argument, which is a string.\n3. The function should return a set of all palindromes of the length of at least 3 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of English letters in the given string that occur between indices 3 and 4, both inclusive.\n4. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.\n5. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere is a Python function that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    """\n    Returns a set of all palindromes of the length of at least 3 such that each palindrome is created\n    from any possible arrangement of English letters in the given string that occur between indices 3\n    and 4, both inclusive.\n    """\n    palindromes = set()\n    letters = [c for c in string.lower() if c.isalpha()]\n    for i in range(len(letters) - 1):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(letters)):\n            palindrome = letters[i] + letters[j]\n            if len(palindrome) >= 3:\n                palindromes.add(palindrome)\n\n    return palindromes\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730599544, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=340, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=561))
