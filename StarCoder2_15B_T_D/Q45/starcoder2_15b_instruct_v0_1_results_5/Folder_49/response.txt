It achieves this by first filtering out non-alphabetic characters from the string and storing them in a list called `letters`. Then, it iterates through all possible substrings of length at least 3 in the `letters` list using two nested `for` loops. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. If it is a palindrome, it adds its lowercase version to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730599096, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=292, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=513))
