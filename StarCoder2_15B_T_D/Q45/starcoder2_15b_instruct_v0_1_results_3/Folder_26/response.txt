ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n1. Extract the text specification from the given instruction.\n2. Create a Python function called `palindromes_between_indices` that takes a single argument, `string`.\n3. The given `string` may consist of any character.\n4. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 3 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given `string` that occur between index 4 to index 6, both inclusive.\n5. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given `string` that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.\n6. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.\n7. Delimit the Python code with triple backticks.\n\nHere\'s how you can solve this problem using Python:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    """\n    Returns the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 3 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 4 to index 6, both inclusive.
