If no such palindromes can be formed, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere is the implementation of `palindromes_between_indices`:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(s):\n    letters = re.findall(r"[a-z]", s.lower())\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(i, 10):\n            palindrome = letters[i:j+1] + letters[i:j+1][::-1]\n            palindromes.add("".join(palindrome))\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as input and extracts the English letters from it using regular expressions. It then iterates through all possible substrings of the letters between indices 5 and 9 and creates palindromes from each substring. The resulting palindromes are added to a set to remove duplicates and returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730598480, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=284, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=505))
