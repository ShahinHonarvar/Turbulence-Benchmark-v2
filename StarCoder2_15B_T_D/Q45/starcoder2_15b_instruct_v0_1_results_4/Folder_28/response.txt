We can then filter out any palindromes of the specified length and return them as a set.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    letters = [c for c in string.lower() if c.isalpha()]\n    palindromes = {"".join(letters[i:j]) for i in range(1, 6) for j in range(i, 6)}\n    return {p for p in palindromes if len(p) >= 4 and p == p[::-1]}\n```\n\n- The first line of the code defines a function called `palindromes_between_indices` that takes one argument, `string`.\n- The second line of the code creates a list called `letters` that contains all the English letters in the given string that occur between indices 1 and 5, both inclusive. The list comprehension uses the `isalpha()` method to check if the character is an English letter and the `lower()` method to convert it to lowercase.\n- The third line of the code creates a set called `palindromes` that contains all possible combinations of the letters in the `letters` list. The set comprehension uses two nested `for` loops to iterate over the indices of the `letters` list and uses the `join()` method to create each combination as a string.\n- The fourth line of the code returns a set comprehension that filters the `palindromes` set to only include palindromes of the specified length and the `== p[::-1]` condition checks if the string is a palindrome.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730597760, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=392, prompt_tokens=221, total_tokens=613))
