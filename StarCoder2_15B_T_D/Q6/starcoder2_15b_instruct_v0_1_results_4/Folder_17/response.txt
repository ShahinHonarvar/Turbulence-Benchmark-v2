Understand the text specification: Inspect the text specification and identify the requirements, such as the function name, arguments, and return value.\n2. Translate into Python code: Convert the requirements into Python code by following the syntax and semantics of Python.\n3. Ensure correctness: Execute the Python code to validate its correctness and adherence to the specification.\n\nHere\'s how you can create the Python code based on the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_neg_ints_exclusive(ints):\n    assert isinstance(ints, list), "ints must be a list"\n    assert all(isinstance(x, int) for x in ints), "ints must contain only integers"\n    return [x for x in ints[62:96] if x < 0]\n```\n\nThe Python code is delimited only by triple backticks. It consists of a function definition called `all_neg_ints_exclusive` that takes a single argument, `ints`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The function returns a list of all negative integers from index 62 to index 96, both exclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730476749, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=276, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=424))
