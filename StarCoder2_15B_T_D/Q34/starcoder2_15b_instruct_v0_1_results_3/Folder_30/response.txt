In this case, the text specification states that you need to write a function called `find_original_set` that takes exactly 78 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nHere's how you could create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    original_set = set.union(*args)\n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis function takes in 78 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. It then finds the union of all the given sets using `set.union`, which returns a new set containing all the elements from all the input sets.
