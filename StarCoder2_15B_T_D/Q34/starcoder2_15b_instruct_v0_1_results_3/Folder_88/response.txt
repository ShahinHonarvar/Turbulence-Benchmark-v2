The first step is to define a function called `find_original_set` that takes exactly 27 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n2. The second step is to define a variable called `original_set` and assign it to an empty set.\n3. The third step is to iterate through each of the given arguments and add them to the `original_set` variable.\n4. The fourth step is to return the `original_set` variable.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    original_set = set()\n    for arg in args:\n        original_set |= arg\n    return original_set\n```\n\nThe `find_original_set` function takes 27 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. It creates an empty set called `original_set`, and then uses the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to add each argument to the `original_set`. Finally, it returns the `original_set` variable, which contains the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730558986, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=261, prompt_tokens=134, total_tokens=395))
