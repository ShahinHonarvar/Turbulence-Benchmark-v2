The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(set1, set2):\n    return set1 | set2\n```\n\nThe function `find_original_set` takes two arguments, `set1` and `set2`, which are both sets of integers. It returns the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nThe implementation uses the set union operator `|` to combine the two sets `set1` and `set2` into a single set. This ensures that the returned set contains all the elements from both sets without duplicates.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730558645, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=181, prompt_tokens=133, total_tokens=314))
