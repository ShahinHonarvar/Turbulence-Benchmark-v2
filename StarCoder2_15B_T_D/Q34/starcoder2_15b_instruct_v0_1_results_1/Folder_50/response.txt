The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nTo achieve this, we can leverage the following properties:\n\n- The function must take exactly 99 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n- The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the function `find_original_set`:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    assert len(args) == 99, "The function must take exactly 99 distinct arguments"\n    assert all(isinstance(arg, set) for arg in args), "Each argument must be a set of integers"\n    smallest_set = set.union(*args)\n    return smallest_set\n```\n\nThe function `find_original_set` takes in 99 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers.
