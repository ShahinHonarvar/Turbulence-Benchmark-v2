The function should be called `find_original_set`.\n2. The function should take exactly 77 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n3. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nBased on these specifications, we can write the following Python code, using the `set.union` method to combine the sets:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set.union(*args)\n```\n\nThe code uses the `set.union` method to combine the sets. The `*` operator is used to unpack the arguments, and the `set.union` method takes a variable number of arguments and returns a new set that contains all the elements from the input sets.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730557693, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=237, prompt_tokens=134, total_tokens=371))
