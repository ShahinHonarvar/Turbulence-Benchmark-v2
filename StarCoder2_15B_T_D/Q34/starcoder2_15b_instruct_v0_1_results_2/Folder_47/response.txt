ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the provided text specification, we can deduce that we need to write a function called `find_original_set` that takes exactly 77 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use Python\'s built-in `set` data type and set operations. We can iterate over the given arguments and compute the union of all the sets, which will result in the smallest set that contains each of the given arguments.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `find_original_set`:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    if len(args)!= 77:\n        raise ValueError("Expected exactly 77 arguments")\n    for arg in args:\n        if not isinstance(arg, set):\n            raise TypeError("Expected a set of integers as an argument")\n    original_set = set()\n    for arg in args:\n        original_set |= arg\n\n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis function takes 77 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. It iterates over the arguments and computes the union of all the sets, which results in the smallest set that contains each of the given arguments.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730558204, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=274, prompt_tokens=134, total_tokens=408))
