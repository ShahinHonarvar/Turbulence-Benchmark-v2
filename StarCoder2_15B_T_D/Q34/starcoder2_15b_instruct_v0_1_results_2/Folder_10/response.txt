ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we need to understand the text specification. The given text specification tells us that we need to create a function called `find_original_set` that takes exactly 92 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    assert len(args) == 92, "The function must take exactly 92 distinct arguments"\n    assert all(isinstance(arg, set) for arg in args), "Each argument must be a set of integers"\n    original_set = set.union(*args)\n    return original_set\n```\n\nThe `find_original_set` function takes in 92 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function then uses the `set.union` method to combine all the sets into a single set. This combined set will contain all the integers that are present in any of the given sets. The function then returns this combined set as the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730558019, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=263, prompt_tokens=134, total_tokens=397))
