It uses the `union` method to combine the two sets into a new set, `original_set`. The `union` method returns a new set containing all elements that are present in either of the two input sets. Since the function is supposed to return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it, the `original_set` is the smallest set that satisfies this requirement.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730559637, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=185, prompt_tokens=133, total_tokens=318))
