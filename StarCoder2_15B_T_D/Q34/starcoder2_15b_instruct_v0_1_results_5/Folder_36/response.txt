Identify the given information:\n    - A function called 'find_original_set' is defined.\n    - The function takes exactly 714 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n    - The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n2. Understand the problem:\n    - The function takes 714 distinct sets as input.\n    - The function should return the smallest set that contains all of the given sets as subsets.\n3. Create the Python code:\n    - The Python code should not contain any comments.\n    - The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nThe Python code for the function 'find_original_set' can be written as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    return set.union(*args)\n```\n\nThe function 'find_original_set' takes any number of arguments, each of which is a set of integers. It returns the union of all the given sets.
