The goal is to return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it. We can implement this as follows:\n\n1. The function `find_original_set` takes in 23 distinct arguments, which are sets of integers.\n2. The function creates an empty set `original_set` to store the smallest set.\n3. The function iterates over each of the given arguments, and for each argument `arg`:\n   1. If `original_set` is empty, it is initialized to `arg`.\n   2. Otherwise, `original_set` is updated to be the intersection of itself and `arg`.\n4. The function returns `original_set` as the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `find_original_set` in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    original_set = set()\n    for arg in args:\n        if not original_set:\n            original_set = arg\n        else:\n            original_set &= arg\n    return original_set\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730559670, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=267, prompt_tokens=134, total_tokens=401))
