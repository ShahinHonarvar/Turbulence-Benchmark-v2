The function takes 46 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n\nTo implement this function, we can use the built-in `set` data type in Python to represent the sets of integers. Since we need to find the smallest set that contains all the given sets, we can start by taking the union of all the given sets and then iteratively remove elements from the union set until it satisfies the requirement.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the `find_original_set` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    union_set = set.union(*args)\n    for element in union_set:\n        if not all(element in s for s in args):\n            union_set.remove(element)\n\n    return union_set\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730559598, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=206, prompt_tokens=134, total_tokens=340))
