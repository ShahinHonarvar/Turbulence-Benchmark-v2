ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code according to the text specification, you should:\n\n1. Understand the specification: The specification states that a function called `insert_before_character` is to be written that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with \'Q\' inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of\'m\'.\n\n2. Translate the specification into Python code: The function can be implemented using string manipulation techniques. The function can iterate through the characters of the input string and insert \'Q\' immediately preceding any occurrences of\'m\'.\n\n3. Generate the Python code: To generate the Python code, you can use a loop to iterate through the characters of the input string and insert \'Q\' when the current character is\'m\'.\n\n4. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited by triple backticks to denote the start and end of the code block.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(s):\n    result = ""\n    for c in s:\n        if c ==\'m\':\n            result += "Qm"\n        else:\n            result += c\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730546754, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=242, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=371))
