The function `insert_before_character` is defined to take one argument, a string, and return a string that is identical except that character 'h' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character '5'.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement the function `insert_before_character`:\n\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(s: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    for c in s:\n        result.append(c)\n        if c == '5':\n            result.append('h')\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each character in the input string and appends it to the result list. If the current character is '5', it also appends 'h' to the result list. Finally, it joins the characters in the result list to form the final string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730546229, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=193, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=322))
