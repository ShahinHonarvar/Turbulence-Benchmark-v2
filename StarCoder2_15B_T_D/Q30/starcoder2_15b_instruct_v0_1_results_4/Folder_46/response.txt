If it is, the character \'W\' is added to the new string before the \'6\'. Otherwise, the current character is added to the new string. The function returns the new string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730546344, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=202, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=331))
