In this case, the specification is to write a function called `insert_before_character` that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with the character \'o\' inserted immediately before any occurrences of the character \'F\'.\n\nHere\'s how you could create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(string):\n    """\n    Insert the character \'o\' immediately before any occurrences of the character \'F\' in a string.\n    """\n    new_string = \'\'\n    for char in string:\n        if char == \'F\':\n            new_string += \'o\'\n        new_string += char\n    return new_string\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `insert_before_character` that takes a string as an argument. It then iterates through the characters in the string and checks if each character is equal to \'F\'. If it is, it inserts the character \'o\' before it. The function returns the new string with the character \'o\' inserted.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730546401, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=229, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=358))
