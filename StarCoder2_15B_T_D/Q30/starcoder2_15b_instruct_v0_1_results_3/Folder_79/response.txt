ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create the Python code, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the specification: The specification states that you need to create a function called `insert_before_character` that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with the character \'E\' inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of the character \'E\' in the original string.\n2. Write the code: The Python code should not contain any comments, so you can write the code directly. You can use string methods like `find` and `replace` to find and replace the character \'E\' in the original string.\n3. Delimit the code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks, so you can use triple backticks to delimit the code.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(string):\n    """\n    Insert character \'E\' immediately preceding any occurrences of character \'E\' in the given string.\n    """\n    return string.replace(\'E\', \'EE\')\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `insert_before_character` that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with the character \'E\' inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of the character \'E\' in the original string. It uses the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of the character \'E\' with the string \'EE\', which inserts the character \'E\' immediately preceding any occurrences of the character \'E\' in the original string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730546039, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=315, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=444))
