Initialize an empty string to store the modified string.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input string.\n3. If the current character is `r`, insert `1` before it in the modified string.\n4. Append the current character to the modified string.\n5. Return the modified string.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(string):\n    modified_string = ""\n    for character in string:\n        if character == "r":\n            modified_string += "1"\n        modified_string += character\n    return modified_string\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the input string. If the current character is `r`, `1` is inserted before it in the modified string. The current character is then appended to the modified string. Finally, the modified string is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730544843, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=240, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=369))
