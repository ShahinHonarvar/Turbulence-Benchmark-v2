ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the given text specification, we can reason about the desired functionality of the function `insert_before_character`. This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical to the input except that the character `\'s\'` has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of the character `\'H\'`.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this behavior:\n\n```python\ndef insert_before_character(text: str) -> str:\n    """\n    Inserts the character\'s\' immediately preceding any occurrences of the character \'H\' in the input string.\n    """\n    output = []\n    for character in text:\n        if character == \'H\':\n            output.append(\'s\')\n        output.append(character)\n    return \'\'.join(output)\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each character in the input string, and if the character is `\'H\'`, it inserts `\'s\'` immediately before it in the output. Otherwise, it appends the character to the output. Finally, it joins the characters in the output list and returns the resulting string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730545104, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=226, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=355))
