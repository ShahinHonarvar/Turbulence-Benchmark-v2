In this case, the text specification states that we need to write a function called `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all even integers from index 29 to index 93, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nThe following is an example of Python code that fulfills the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(ints):\n    return sum(i for i in ints[29:94] if i % 2 == 0)\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730504616, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=155, prompt_tokens=147, total_tokens=302))
