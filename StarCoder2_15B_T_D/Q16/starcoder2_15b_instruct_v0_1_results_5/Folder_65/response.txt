Define the function `sum_even_ints_inclusive` with one parameter, `nums`.\n2. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of even integers.\n3. Loop over the list `nums` from index 56 to index 98, both inclusive, using a `for` loop.\n4. Within the loop, check if the current integer is even using the modulo operator (`%`).\n5. If the current integer is even, add it to the `sum` variable.\n6. After the loop, return the `sum` variable.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(56, 99):\n        if nums[i] % 2 == 0:\n            sum += nums[i]\n    return sum\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the list of integers from index 56 to index 98, both inclusive, and checks if each integer is even. If it is, it is added to the `sum` variable. At the end, the `sum` variable is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730506067, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=305, prompt_tokens=147, total_tokens=452))
