Extract the text specification: The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets, so you can use a regular expression or string manipulation techniques to extract it.\n2. Generate the Python code: Based on the text specification, you can generate the Python code that does not contain any comments and is delimited by triple backticks.\n3. Generate the Markdown output: To generate the Markdown output, you can use a template or string formatting techniques to combine the Python code with the triple backticks delimiters.\n\nHere\'s an example of how you can create Python code that does not contain any comments and is delimited by triple backticks, based on the text specification:\n\n```python\nimport re\ntext_specification = "<Write a function called \'if_perfect_num\' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 78 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.>"\ntext_specification = re.sub(r\'<|>\', \'\', text_specification)\npython_code = """\ndef if_perfect_num(lst):\n    def is_perfect_num(num):\n        sum_of_divisors = 0\n        for i in range(1, num):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                sum_of_divisors += i\n        return sum_of_divisors == num\n    return is_perfect_num(lst[78])\n"""\nmarkdown_output = f"""```python\n{python_code}\n```"""\nprint(markdown_output)\n```\n\nThe regular expression `r\'<|>\'` is used to remove the angle brackets from the text specification. The Python code is generated by defining a function `if_perfect_num` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns a boolean value based on the integer at index 78. The function `is_perfect_num` is defined to determine if a number is a perfect number. The Markdown output is generated by combining the Python code with the triple backticks delimiters.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730550787, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=460, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=589))
