For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\nHere's how you could implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(nums):\n    num = nums[69]\n    sum_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, num):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            sum_divisors += i\n    return sum_divisors == num\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730548095, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=193, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=322))
