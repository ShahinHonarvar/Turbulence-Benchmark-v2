Extract the key information from the text specification. In this case, you are asked to create a function called `if_perfect_num` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns `true` if the integer at index 312 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return `false`.\n2. Generate the Python code that achieves the desired functionality. In this case, you can create a function called `if_perfect_num` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns `true` if the integer at index 312 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return `false`.\n3. Remove any unnecessary comments or additional code. In this case, there are no comments or additional code.\n4. Delimit the Python code using triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(lst):\n    return is_perfect_num(lst[312])\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730547248, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=239, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=369))
