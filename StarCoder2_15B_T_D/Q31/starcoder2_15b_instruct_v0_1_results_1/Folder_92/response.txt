For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `if_perfect_num` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(nums):\n    if nums[0] <= 0:\n        return False\n    sum_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, nums[0] // 2 + 1):\n        if nums[0] % i == 0:\n            sum_divisors += i\n    return sum_divisors == nums[0]\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730547848, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=224, prompt_tokens=128, total_tokens=352))
