It takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns `True` if the integer at index 74 is a perfect number, otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThe second function `is_perfect_num` is a helper function that determines whether a given number is a perfect number. It calculates the sum of its factors and returns `True` if the sum is equal to the number itself, otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nNote that this is just a sample implementation to demonstrate the creation of Python code according to the text specification. You might need to adjust the implementation based on the specific requirements of the problem.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730547306, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=240, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=369))
