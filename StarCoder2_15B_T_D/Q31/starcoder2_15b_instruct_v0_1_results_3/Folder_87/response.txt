A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730549343, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=204, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=333))
