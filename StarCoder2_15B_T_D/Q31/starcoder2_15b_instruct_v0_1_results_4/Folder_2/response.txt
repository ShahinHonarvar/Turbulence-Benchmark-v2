A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its positive divisors, 1, 2, and 3, sum up to 6.\n\nHere is the code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(nums):\n    def is_perfect_num(num):\n        sum_of_divisors = 0\n        for i in range(1, num):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                sum_of_divisors += i\n        return sum_of_divisors == num\n    return is_perfect_num(nums[702])\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `if_perfect_num` that takes a list of positive integers as its argument. It then defines an inner function `is_perfect_num` that checks if a given number is a perfect number. The `is_perfect_num` function iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to the given number, and checks if the number is a divisor of the given number. If it is, it adds it to the sum of divisors. Finally, it returns True if the sum of divisors is equal to the given number, and False otherwise.\n\nThe `if_perfect_num` function then calls the `is_perfect_num` function with the number at index 702 of the given list, and returns the result.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730549478, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=341, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=471))
