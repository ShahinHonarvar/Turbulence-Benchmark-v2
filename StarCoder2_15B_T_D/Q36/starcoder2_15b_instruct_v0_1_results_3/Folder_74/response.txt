The function should remove all occurrences of a specific character from a given range in the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact.\n\nHere's how you could implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for i in range(33, 36):\n        char = chr(i)\n        if char > '>' and char < 'A':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n\n    return string\n```\n\nThe function iterates through the ASCII characters between indices 33 and 36 (exclusive) and checks if the character is greater than '>' and smaller than 'A'. If it is, all occurrences of that character are removed from the string using the `replace` method. The function returns the altered string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730565775, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=192, prompt_tokens=173, total_tokens=365))
