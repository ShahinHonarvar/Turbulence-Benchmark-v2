Define a function called `filter_chars` that takes one argument, `s`, which is the string to be filtered.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string using a for-loop.\n3. Check if the index of the character is between 32 and 84 (exclusive) using `i >= 32 and i < 84`.\n4. If the character is greater than `'m'` and smaller than `'w'`, use the `str.replace` method to remove all occurrences of that character within the string.\n5. Return the altered string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if i >= 32 and i < 84 and'm' < c < 'w':\n            s = s.replace(c, '')\n\n    return s\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730565374, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=225, prompt_tokens=174, total_tokens=399))
