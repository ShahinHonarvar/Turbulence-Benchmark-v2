To achieve this, we use a list to store the new characters and a for loop to iterate through the characters in the input string. If the current character is not between indices 69 and 87 or not between characters '#' and 'L', it is added to the list. Finally, we return the new string by joining the characters in the list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730565294, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=205, prompt_tokens=172, total_tokens=377))
