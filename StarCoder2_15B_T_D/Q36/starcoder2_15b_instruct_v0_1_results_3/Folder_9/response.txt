For each character, we check if its index is between 50 and 92 (exclusive) and if it is greater than 'A' and smaller than 'Q'. If both conditions are met, we remove all occurrences of that character from the string. Otherwise, we append the character to the `result` list. Finally, we join the characters in the `result` list to form the filtered string and return it.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730565353, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=189, prompt_tokens=174, total_tokens=363))
