The function should remove all occurrences of characters within the range of indices 32 to 61 (exclusive) from the given string, but only if the character is greater than `'3'` and smaller than `'D'`.\n\nHere is the implementation of `filter_chars`:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c < '3' or c >= 'D':\n            result.append(c)\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThe function iterates over each character in the given string and checks if it is within the range of indices 32 to 61 (exclusive). If the character is greater than `'3'` and smaller than `'D'`, it is added to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the altered string by joining the characters in the `result` list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730565865, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=215, prompt_tokens=174, total_tokens=389))
