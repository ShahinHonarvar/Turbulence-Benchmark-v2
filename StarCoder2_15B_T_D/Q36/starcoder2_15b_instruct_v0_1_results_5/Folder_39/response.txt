Extract the characters between indices 43 and 59 (both exclusive) from the given string.\n2. Identify the characters to be removed based on their ASCII values.\n3. Iterate over the extracted characters and remove any that fall within the desired range.\n4. Construct a new string with the remaining characters in the same order.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    extracted_chars = string[43:59]\n    to_remove = set()\n    for char in extracted_chars:\n        if ord(char) > ord(\'5\') and ord(char) < ord(\'C\'):\n            to_remove.add(char)\n    result = ""\n    for char in string:\n        if char not in to_remove:\n            result += char\n\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730566824, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=230, prompt_tokens=174, total_tokens=404))
