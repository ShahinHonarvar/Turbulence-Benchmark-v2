Parse the text specification: Identify the function name, the number and types of arguments, and the logic for each character.\n2. Generate Python code: Use the information from the text specification to write the Python function.\n3. Remove comments: The Python code should not contain any comments.\n4. Delimit the code: The Python code should be delimited by triple backticks.\n\nHere is the Python code that follows the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    result = []\n    for char in string:\n        if char > '#' and char < 'T':\n            continue\n        result.append(char)\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as an argument and iterates through each character in the string. If the character is between indices 66 and 90 (both exclusive) and is greater than '#' and smaller than 'T', it is removed from the string. The function returns the altered string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730567077, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=227, prompt_tokens=172, total_tokens=399))
