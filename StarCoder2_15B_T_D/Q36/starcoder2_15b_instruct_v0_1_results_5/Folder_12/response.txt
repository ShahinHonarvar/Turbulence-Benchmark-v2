Define a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string.\n2. Iterate through each character in the string.\n3. If the character is between indices 32 and 84 (both exclusive) and is greater than'm' and smaller than 'w', remove all occurrences of that character from the string.\n4. Return the altered string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    filtered_string = ''\n    for char in string:\n        if (32 < ord(char) < 84) and (char >'m') and (char < 'w'):\n            filtered_string += char\n    return filtered_string\n```\n\nThe function 'filter_chars' takes a string as input and iterates through each character in the string. If the character is between indices 32 and 84 (both exclusive) and is greater than'm' and smaller than 'w', it removes all occurrences of that character from the string. The function returns the altered string.\n\nNote that the function uses the 'ord' function to convert the character to its ASCII value, which is then used to check if it is between indices 32 and 84.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730566646, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=290, prompt_tokens=174, total_tokens=464))
