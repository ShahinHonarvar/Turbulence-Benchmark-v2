The function iterates over the characters in the input string and checks if each character is within the specified range. If the character is outside the range, it is skipped. Otherwise, it is added to the filtered string. The function returns the filtered string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730567202, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=199, prompt_tokens=175, total_tokens=374))
