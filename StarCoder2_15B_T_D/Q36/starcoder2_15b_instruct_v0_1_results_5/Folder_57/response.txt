For each character, if the index is outside the range 70 to 74 (exclusive) or the character is outside the range \'A\' to \'U\' (exclusive), it is added to the `filtered` string. Otherwise, the character is skipped.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730566971, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=194, prompt_tokens=174, total_tokens=368))
