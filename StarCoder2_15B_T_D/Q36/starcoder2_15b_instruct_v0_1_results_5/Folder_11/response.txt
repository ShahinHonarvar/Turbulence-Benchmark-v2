If the character is greater than 'E' and smaller than '~', it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set. Then, a list comprehension is used to filter out all characters in the string that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, and the filtered list is joined back into a string. The final string is returned as the result.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730566632, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=187, prompt_tokens=173, total_tokens=360))
