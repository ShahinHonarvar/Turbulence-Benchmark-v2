If the character meets these conditions, it is appended to the `filtered` string. Otherwise, it is skipped. At the end, the function returns the `filtered` string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730566661, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=255, prompt_tokens=174, total_tokens=429))
