The text specification states that a function called `filter_chars` is defined that takes one argument, a string. It also states that for each character between indices 90 and 97 (both exclusive) in the given string, if the character is greater than `j` and smaller than `w`, all occurrences of that character should be removed within the string while keeping the order of all characters intact. Finally, the function should return the altered string.\n\nHere is the Python code that corresponds to the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for i in range(90, 97):\n        char = chr(i)\n        if char > 'j' and char < 'w':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```\n\nThe code iterates through each character between indices 90 and 97 (both exclusive) using a `for` loop. For each character, it checks if it is greater than `j` and smaller than `w`. If so, it removes all occurrences of that character from the string using the `replace` method. Finally, it returns the altered string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730566299, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=267, prompt_tokens=174, total_tokens=441))
