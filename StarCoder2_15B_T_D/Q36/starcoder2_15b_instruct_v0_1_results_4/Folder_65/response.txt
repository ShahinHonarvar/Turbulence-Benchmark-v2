For each character, we check if it is between the indices 58 and 82 (both exclusive) using the `ord` function to convert the character to its ASCII value. If the character is greater than `'F'` and smaller than `'O'`, we remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. We use a list to collect the filtered characters and join them back into a string at the end.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730566380, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=189, prompt_tokens=174, total_tokens=363))
