The challenge provides the following steps to follow:\n\n1. Create a function called `filter_chars` that takes one argument, a string.\n2. For each character between indices 56 and 86 (both exclusive) in the given string, if the character is greater than '+' and smaller than 'w', remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact.\n3. Return the altered string.\n\nHere's how you could implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    filtered_string = ''\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if i >= 56 and i < 86 and '+' < c < 'w':\n            continue\n        filtered_string += c\n    return filtered_string\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the characters in the given string and checks if the current character is between indices 56 and 86 (exclusive) and is greater than '+' and smaller than 'w'. If the character meets these conditions, it is skipped and not added to the filtered string. Otherwise, the character is added to the filtered string. Finally, the filtered string is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730566548, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=273, prompt_tokens=172, total_tokens=445))
