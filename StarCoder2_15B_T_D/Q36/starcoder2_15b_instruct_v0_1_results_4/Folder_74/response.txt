It iterates over each character in the string and checks if the character is between the indices 33 and 36 (both exclusive). If the character is greater than \'>\' and smaller than \'A\', the character is skipped and not added to the filtered string. Otherwise, the character is added to the filtered string. The function returns the filtered string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730566418, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=151, prompt_tokens=173, total_tokens=324))
