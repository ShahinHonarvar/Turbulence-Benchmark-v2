Extract the text inside the angle brackets.\n2. Remove all comments from the text.\n3. Remove the triple backticks from the text.\n4. Use the remaining text as the Python code.\n\nHere's an example of how you can create Python code according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    filtered_chars = []\n    for c in s:\n        if not (18 < ord(c) < 95 and ord('K') < ord(c) < ord('a')):\n            filtered_chars.append(c)\n    return ''.join(filtered_chars)\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the string, and checks if the character is between indices 18 and 95 (both exclusive) and greater than character 'K' and smaller than character 'a'. If the condition is met, the character is appended to the filtered characters list. Finally, the filtered characters are joined together and returned as a string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730566091, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=234, prompt_tokens=174, total_tokens=408))
