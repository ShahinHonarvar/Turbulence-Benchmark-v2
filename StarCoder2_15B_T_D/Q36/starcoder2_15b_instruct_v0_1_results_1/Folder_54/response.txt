If the condition is true, the character is not included in the filtered string.\n- If the character is not greater than `)` and smaller than `P`, or if the index is not between 18 and 38, the character is appended to the `filtered_string`.\n- The function returns the filtered string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730564393, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=272, prompt_tokens=172, total_tokens=444))
