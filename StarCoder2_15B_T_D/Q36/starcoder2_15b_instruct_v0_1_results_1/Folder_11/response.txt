It iterates through each character in the string and checks if the character is between indices 86 and 93 (both exclusive) and greater than character 'E' and smaller than character '~'. If the condition is satisfied, the character is skipped and not added to the filtered string. Otherwise, the character is added to the filtered string. Finally, the function returns the filtered string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730564112, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=156, prompt_tokens=173, total_tokens=329))
