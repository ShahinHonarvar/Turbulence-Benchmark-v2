If the character is between indices 1 and 6 (exclusive) and is greater than \',\' and smaller than \'f\', it is removed from the string. Otherwise, it is added to the filtered string. Finally, the filtered string is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730565245, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=129, prompt_tokens=170, total_tokens=299))
