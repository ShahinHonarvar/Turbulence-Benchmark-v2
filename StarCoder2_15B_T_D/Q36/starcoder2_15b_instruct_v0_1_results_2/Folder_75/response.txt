For each character, we check if it is greater than '&' and smaller than 'M'. If it is, we remove all occurrences of that character from the string using the `str.replace()` method.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    for i in range(46, 74):\n        if s[i] > '&' and s[i] < 'M':\n            s = s.replace(s[i], '')\n    return s\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a for loop to iterate through the characters between indices 46 and 74 (exclusive).
