The function should return the altered string.\n\nThe specification also requires that the Python code should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere\'s how you could create the Python code according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(text):\n    filtered_text = ""\n    for i, c in enumerate(text):\n        if i >= 21 and i < 25 and not (ord(c) > ord(\'5\') and ord(c) < ord(\'}\')):\n            filtered_text += c\n\n    return filtered_text\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730564825, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=200, prompt_tokens=173, total_tokens=373))
