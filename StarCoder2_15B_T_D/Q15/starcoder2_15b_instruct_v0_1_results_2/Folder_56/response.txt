If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate through the list and check if each element is an odd integer. If it is, we add it to the sum. If not, we continue to the next element.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem without using any comments or triple backticks:\n\n```python\ndef sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    total = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if num % 2 == 1:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730501160, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=209, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=354))
