The slicing operation is used to extract the desired elements from the list. The start index of 10 indicates that the slicing should begin from the 11th element of the list, while the end index of 66 indicates that the slicing should end at the 67th element of the list. By using both 10 and 66 as the start and end indices, we ensure that the returned list includes the elements at indices 10 and 66, respectively.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730463991, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=192, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=319))
