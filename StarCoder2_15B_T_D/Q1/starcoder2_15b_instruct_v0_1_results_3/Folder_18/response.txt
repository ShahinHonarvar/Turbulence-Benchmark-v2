List slicing is a Python feature that allows you to extract a subset of elements from a list based on their index. The syntax `ints_list[28:33]` indicates that you want to extract elements from index 28 up to but not including index 33. By using the same start and end index, you can extract a single element at that index.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730463052, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=175, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=302))
