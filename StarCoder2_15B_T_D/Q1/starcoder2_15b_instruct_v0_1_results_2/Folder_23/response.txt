The syntax for slicing in Python is `list[start:stop]`, where `start` is the index of the first element to include and `stop` is the index of the first element to exclude. By using `28:41` as the slice, you can select the elements from index 28 to index 40, both inclusive.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730462626, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=187, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=314))
