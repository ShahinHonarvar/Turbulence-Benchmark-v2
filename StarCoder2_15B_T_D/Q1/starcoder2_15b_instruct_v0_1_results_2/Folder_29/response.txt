The function uses the list slicing syntax to select the required elements from the list.\n\nYou can test your code with the provided assertions to verify that the function works correctly:\n\n```python\nints_list = [i for i in range(100)]\nresult = all_ints_inclusive(ints_list)\nassert result == list(range(19, 93))\nints_list = [i for i in range(50)]\nresult = all_ints_inclusive(ints_list)\nassert result == list(range(19, 93))\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730462666, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=347, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=474))
