The slice notation in Python uses the syntax `[start:stop]`, where `start` is the index of the first element to include in the slice, and `stop` is the index of the first element to exclude from the slice. By using `91` as the `start` index and `100` as the `stop` index, we can obtain a slice that includes all elements from index 91 to index 99, both inclusive.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730462568, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=160, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=287))
