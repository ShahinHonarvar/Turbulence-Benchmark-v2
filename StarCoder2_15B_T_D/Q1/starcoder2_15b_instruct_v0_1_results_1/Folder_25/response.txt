Define the function `all_ints_inclusive` with one argument, `ints_list`, which is a list of integers.\n2. Use list slicing to extract the required elements from the list. List slicing in Python is a powerful feature that allows you to select a specific range of elements from a list.\n3. Return the sliced list from the function.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(ints_list):\n    return ints_list[75:89]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all elements from index 75 to index 88, both inclusive. List slicing is used to extract the required elements from the list, and the resulting sliced list is returned from the function.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730462173, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=233, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=360))
