Understand the text specification: In this case, the text specification is "a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 21 to index 97, both inclusive."\n2. Translate the text specification into code: You can translate the text specification into a Python function called `all_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all elements from index 21 to index 97, both inclusive.\n3. Write the code: You can write the Python function using list slicing to extract the required elements from the list.\n4. Test the code: You can test the `all_ints_inclusive` function with different lists to verify that it returns the expected elements from index 21 to index 97, both inclusive.\n\nHere is the code that you can use to create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return lst[21:98]\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `all_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all elements from index 21 to index 97, both inclusive. It uses list slicing to extract the required elements from the list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730462387, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=310, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=437))
