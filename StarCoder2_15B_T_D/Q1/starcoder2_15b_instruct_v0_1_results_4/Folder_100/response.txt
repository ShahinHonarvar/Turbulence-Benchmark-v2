The slice is obtained by using the list slicing syntax `my_list[start:end]`, where `start` is the index of the first element to include in the slice and `end` is the index of the first element to exclude from the slice. In this case, `start` is 70 and `end` is 85, since the slice should include the elements from index 70 to index 84.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730463813, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=175, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=302))
