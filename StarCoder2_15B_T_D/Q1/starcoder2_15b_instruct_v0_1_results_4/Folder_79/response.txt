Understand the text specification: In this case, the text specification is "Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 6 to index 6, both inclusive."\n2. Extract the information: From the text specification, you can extract the following information:\n    - Function name: all_ints_inclusive\n    - Function arguments: One argument, a list of integers\n    - Function behavior: Return the list of all elements from index 6 to index 6, both inclusive\n3. Write the Python code: Based on the information you extracted, you can write the following Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return nums[6:7]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all elements from index 6 to index 6, both inclusive.\n\n4. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nTo create Python code according to the text specification, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.
