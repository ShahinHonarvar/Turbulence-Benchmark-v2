ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code according to the given text specification, you need to understand the requirement. The requirement states that you need to write a function called `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 94 that exist in the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nYou can create the Python code using the `re` module to find all the palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 94 in a case-insensitive manner using the following regular expression: `r'(?i)([a-z]{94,})(\\1)'`. The regular expression uses the `(?i)` flag to match in a case-insensitive manner, the `([a-z]{94,})` pattern to match a palindrome of the length greater than or equal to 94 consisting of only English letters, and the `\\1` backreference to match the same palindrome in reverse order.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):\n    return set(re.findall(r'(?i)([a-z]{94,})(\\1)', string))\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730651148, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=327, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=511))
