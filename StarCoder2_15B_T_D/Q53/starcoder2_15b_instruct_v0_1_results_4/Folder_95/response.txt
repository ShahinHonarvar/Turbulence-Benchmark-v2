The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner, meaning it should not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\nHere's how you could implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(string) - 34):\n        for j in range(i + 35, len(string) + 1):\n            substring = string[i:j]\n            if substring == substring[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe function `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` takes a string as an argument and iterates over all substrings of length greater than or equal to 35. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. If the substring is a palindrome, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` iterates over all substrings of length greater than or equal to 35 in the given string.
