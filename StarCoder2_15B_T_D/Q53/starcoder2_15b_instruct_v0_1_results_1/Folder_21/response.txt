We can then filter out the palindromes that consist of only English letters and convert them to a set.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):\n    """\n    Finds all palindromes of length at least 112 in the given string\'s\'.\n    Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n    """\n    palindromes = re.findall(r\'(?i)(\\w{112,})\', s)\n    return {p for p in palindromes if p == p[::-1]}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a regular expression to find all palindromes of length at least 112 in the given string. The regular expression `(?i)(\\w{112,})` matches a sequence of at least 112 English letters, ignoring the case. The `findall` function then returns a list of all matching palindromes.\n\nWe then filter out the palindromes that consist of only English letters by checking if the palindrome is equal to its reversed self. Finally, we convert the filtered palindromes to a set to remove any duplicates.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730641900, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=293, prompt_tokens=185, total_tokens=478))
