Extract the function name and parameters from the text specification.\n2. Extract the minimum length of the palindromes to be found.\n3. Extract the requirement that the palindromes should only consist of English letters.\n4. Extract the requirement that the palindromes should be of length greater than or equal to 11.\n5. Extract the requirement that the function should return an empty set if no such palindromes exist in the given string.\n6. Extract the requirement that the function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nThe Python code should not contain any comments, so we should not include any comments in our code. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks, so we should not include any additional backticks in our code.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(string) - 11):\n        for j in range(i + 11, len(string) + 1):\n            substring = string[i:j]\n            if substring.lower() == substring[::-1].lower():\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a nested loop to iterate over all possible substrings of length at least 11 in the given string. For each such substring, we check if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. If it is a palindrome, we add it to the set of palindromes. Finally, we return the set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730643264, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=383, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=567))
