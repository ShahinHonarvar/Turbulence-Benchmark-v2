Write a function called `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes one argument, a string.\n2. Find all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 96 in the given string.\n3. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n4. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set.\n5. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's how you can write the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):\n    result = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - 96):\n        for j in range(i + 96, len(s) + 1):\n            substring = s[i:j]\n            if substring == substring[::-1] and substring.isalpha():\n                result.add(substring)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 96 that exist in the given string. The function iterates over all substrings of length greater than or equal to 96 in the given string and checks if they are palindromes. A substring is considered a palindrome if it is the same when read backwards. The function also checks if each substring consists only of English letters. If so, the substring is added to the result set. Finally, the function returns the result set, which contains all the palindromes of length greater than or equal to 96 in the given string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730643460, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=383, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=567))
