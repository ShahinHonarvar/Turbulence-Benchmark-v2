Create a function called `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes one argument, a string.\n2. Inside the function, define a regular expression pattern that matches all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 45 that consist of only English letters.\n3. Use the `re` module to find all matches of the pattern in the given string.\n4. Convert the matches to a set and return it.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):\n    pattern = r'\\b[A-Za-z]{45,}\\b'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, string)\n    return set(matches)\n```\n\nThe regular expression pattern, `r'\\b[A-Za-z]{45,}\\b'`, matches all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 45 that consist of only English letters. The `\\b` metacharacters indicate word boundaries, ensuring that the matched palindromes are not part of longer words. The `[A-Za-z]` character class matches any English letter, including both uppercase and lowercase letters. The `{45,}` quantifier specifies that the matched palindromes must be of length greater than or equal to 45.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730641638, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=315, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=499))
