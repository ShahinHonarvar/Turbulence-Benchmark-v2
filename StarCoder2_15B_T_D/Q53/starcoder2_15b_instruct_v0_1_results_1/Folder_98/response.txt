To do this, we will use regular expressions to find all palindromes in the given string and then filter out those that are less than 6 characters long.\n\nHere is the Python function:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):\n    pattern = r"(?)=([a-zA-Z]{6,})"\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, s, re.IGNORECASE)\n    return {match[1].lower() for match in matches}\n```\n\nThe regular expression pattern `r"(?)=([a-zA-Z]{6,})"` consists of the following parts:\n\n- `(?)`: This is a positive lookbehind assertion that ensures that the characters before the palindrome are not the same as the characters after the palindrome.\n- `=`: This is a literal equal sign that serves as a delimiter between the characters before the palindrome and the characters after the palindrome.\n- `([a-zA-Z]{6,})`: This is a capturing group that matches one or more English letters (both uppercase and lowercase) that are at least 6 characters long.\n\nThe regular expression pattern is used with `re.findall` to find all palindromes in the given string. The `re.IGNORECASE` flag is used to make the match case-insensitive.\n\nThe function returns a set of all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 6 that exist in the given string. Each palindrome in the set is lowercased to ensure consistency.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730643751, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=392, prompt_tokens=183, total_tokens=575))
