Parse the text specification: Parse the text specification to understand the requirements of the Python code. In this case, the specification states that the Python code should not contain any comments, and it should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n2. Create Python code: Create Python code that meets the requirements specified in the text specification. In this case, the specification states that the Python code should be a function called 'palindrome_of_length_at_least_n' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 90 that exist in the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n3. Verify the code: Verify that the created Python code meets the requirements specified in the text specification. In this case, the specification states that the Python code should not contain any comments, and it should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):\n    s = s.lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        for j in range(i + 90, len(s) + 1):\n            substring = s[i:j]\n            if substring == substring[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730649259, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=366, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=550))
