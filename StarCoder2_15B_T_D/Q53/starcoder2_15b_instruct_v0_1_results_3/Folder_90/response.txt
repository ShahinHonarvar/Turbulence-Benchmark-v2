ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use regular expressions to find all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 140 in the given string. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. To find palindromes, we can use the following regular expression: `(?<=^.{140,})(.+?)\\1(?=.*$)`\n\nThis regular expression matches palindromes of length greater than or equal to 140 by using the following parts:\n- `(?<=^.{140,})`: Asserts that the current position in the string is preceded by at least 140 characters from the start of the string.\n- `(.+?)`: Matches and captures any non-empty sequence of characters (lazy) into group 1.\n- `\\1`: Matches the same text that was captured by group 1.\n- `(?=.*$)`: Asserts that the current position in the string is followed by zero or more characters (including newlines) and then the end of the string.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):\n    pattern = re.compile(r"(?<=^.{140,})(.+?)\\1(?=.*$)", re.IGNORECASE)\n    return set(pattern.findall(string))\n```\n\nThe `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` function takes a string as input and returns a set of palindromes of length greater than or equal to 140 that exist in the string. The regular expression `(?<=^.{140,})(.+?)\\1(?=.*$)` is used to find these palindromes. The `re.IGNORECASE` flag is used to make the matching case-insensitive.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730649103, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=401, prompt_tokens=185, total_tokens=586))
