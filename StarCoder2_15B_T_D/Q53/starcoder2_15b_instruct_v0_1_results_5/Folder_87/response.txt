ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="You need to write a Python function called `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 18 that exist in the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):\n    string = string.lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        for j in range(i + 18, len(string) + 1):\n            substring = string[i:j]\n            if substring == substring[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible substrings of length at least 18 in the given string. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. If it is a palindrome, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the set of palindromes is returned.\n\nNote that the `lower()` method is used to convert the string to lowercase before finding the palindromes, which is necessary for a case-insensitive search.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730652915, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=324, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=508))
