The function should only consider palindromes that consist of English letters and find them in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):\n    string = string.lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(string) - 32):\n        for j in range(i + 33, len(string) + 1):\n            if string[i:j] == string[i:j][::-1] and string[i:j].isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(string[i:j])\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe function `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length at least 33 that exist in the string. It first converts the string to lowercase and initializes a set to store the palindromes. Then, it iterates over the string from left to right, starting from the 33rd character. For eachsubstring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with the reversed version of itself. If the substring is a palindrome and consists of only English letters, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730652809, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=357, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=541))
