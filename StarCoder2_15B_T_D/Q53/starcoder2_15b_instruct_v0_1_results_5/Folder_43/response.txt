ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code based on a text specification, you need to understand the specification. In this case, the specification requires you to create a function called `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes a string as an argument and returns a set of palindromes of length greater than or equal to 49 that exist in the string. Palindromes should only consist of English letters and should be found in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):\n    palindromes = set()\n    string_lowercase = string.lower()\n    for i in range(len(string_lowercase) - 49):\n        for j in range(i + 49, len(string_lowercase)):\n            substring = string_lowercase[i:j + 1]\n            if substring == substring[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes a string as an argument. It then converts the string to lowercase and iterates over all substrings of length at least 49. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If it is a palindrome, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the set of palindromes is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730652269, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=320, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=504))
