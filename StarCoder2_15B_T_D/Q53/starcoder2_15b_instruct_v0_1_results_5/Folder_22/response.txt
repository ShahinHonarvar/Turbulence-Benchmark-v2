Understand the text specification: Read and understand the text specification carefully to identify the requirements and constraints. This will help in crafting the Python code.\n2. Create the function: Start by creating the function called `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes one argument, a string.\n3. Find palindromes: Use a regular expression to find all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 97 in the given string.\n4. Filter English letters: Use a regular expression to filter out palindromes that consist only of English letters.\n5. Case-insensitive matching: Make the palindrome matching case-insensitive by using a regular expression flag.\n6. Return the set of palindromes: Return the set of palindromes found in the given string. If no palindromes are found, return an empty set.\n\nHere\'s how you can create the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):\n    palindromes = set()\n    pattern = re.compile(r\'(?i)(\\b[a-z]{97,}\\b)\', flags=re.I)\n    matches = pattern.findall(string)\n    for match in matches:\n        if match.lower() == match[::-1].lower():\n            palindromes.add(match)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nYou can validate this code by running the following test cases:\n\n```python\ntest_data = [\n    ("This is a test string with a palindrome of length 97: NagarniN", {"NagarniN"}),\n    ("This is a test string with no palindromes of length 97", set()),\n    ("This is a test string with a palindrome of length 96: Nagarni", set()),\n    ("This is a test string with a palindrome of length 98: NagarniNN", set()),\n    ("This is a test string with a palindrome of length 97: NagarniNN", set()),\n]\nfor string, expected_output in test_data:\n    assert palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string) == expected_output\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730651995, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=518, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=702))
