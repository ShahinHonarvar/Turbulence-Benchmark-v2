In this case, the specification says that you should create a function called `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 95 that exist in the string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters, and if no such palindromes exist, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's how you could create the Python code based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(text):\n    n = 95\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(text) - n + 1):\n        window = text[i:i+n]\n        reversed_window = window[::-1]\n        if window.lower() == reversed_window.lower():\n            palindromes.add(window)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function called `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes a string as an argument. We then set the minimum length of the palindromes we want to find to 95. We iterate over the string and check if each substring of length 95 is a palindrome. We use the `lower()` method to convert the substring and its reverse to lowercase before comparing them. If they are equal, we add the substring to the `palindromes` set. Finally, we return the `palindromes` set.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730651832, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=368, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=552))
