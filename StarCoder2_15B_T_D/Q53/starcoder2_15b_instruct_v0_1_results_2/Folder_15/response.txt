The regular expression should match palindromes that consist of at least 4 characters, which can be done by using a lookahead assertion to check if the first four characters are the same as the last four characters. To ensure that the palindrome consists of only English letters, we can use a word boundary to ensure that the palindrome is surrounded by non-word characters.\n\nHere is the Python function that uses regular expressions to find all palindromes of length at least 4 in a given string:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):\n    pattern = r'\\b(?=((\\w)\\2{3,}\\2)(\\2{3,}\\2)*)\\1\\b'\n    return set(re.findall(pattern, string, flags=re.IGNORECASE))\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730644000, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=208, prompt_tokens=183, total_tokens=391))
