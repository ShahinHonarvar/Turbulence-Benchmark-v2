We use a regular expression pattern, `\\b[a-z]{55,}\\b`, to match such palindromes. The pattern matches a word boundary, followed by at least 55 lowercase English letters, followed by another word boundary. We use the `re.findall` function to find all matches of this pattern in the given string.\n\nAfter finding the matches, we iterate through them and add those that are actually palindromes to the `palindromes` set. We check if a match is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.\n\nFinally, we return the set of palindromes found in the given string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730643790, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=299, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=483))
