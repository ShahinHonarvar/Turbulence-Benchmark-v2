ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code that follows the given specification, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the specification: The given specification states that we need to write a function called `if_decimal_is_divisible` that takes a binary representation of a non-negative decimal integer as an argument. The function should return `True` if the decimal integer corresponding to the given binary string is divisible by the 97th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. Convert binary to decimal: To determine whether a decimal integer is divisible by a number, we need to convert the binary representation to a decimal integer. We can do this by iterating over the binary string and multiplying each digit by its corresponding power of 2.\n\n3. Determine divisibility: To determine whether the decimal integer is divisible by the 97th number in the Fibonacci sequence, we can use the following approach:\n   - Generate the first 97 Fibonacci numbers using a dynamic programming approach.\n   - Iterate over the Fibonacci numbers to find the first number that is greater than or equal to the decimal integer.\n   - If the decimal integer is divisible by the found Fibonacci number, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\n\n4. Generate Fibonacci numbers: To generate the first 97 Fibonacci numbers, we can use the following approach:\n   - Initialize `fib[0]` and `fib[1]` to 0 and 1, respectively.\n   - Iterate over the remaining indices from 2 to 97, computing each Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous two numbers.\n   - Store the computed Fibonacci numbers in the `fib` array.\n\n5. Divisibility check: To check if the decimal integer is divisible by the found Fibonacci number, we can use the modulo operator (`%`) to determine the remainder of the division. If the remainder is 0, the integer is divisible; otherwise, it is not divisible.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_string):\n    decimal_integer = 0\n    for i, digit in enumerate(binary_string):\n        decimal_integer += int(digit) * (2 ** (len(binary_string) - 1 - i))\n\n    fib = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, 97):\n        fib.append(fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2])\n\n    for fib_number in fib:\n        if fib_number >= decimal_integer:\n            break\n\n    return decimal_integer % fib_number == 0\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The `if_decimal_is_divisible` function takes a binary string as an argument and returns `True` if the decimal integer corresponding to the binary string is divisible by the 97th number in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n- The `decimal_integer` variable is initialized to 0 and is used to store the decimal equivalent of the given binary string. The binary string is iterated over and each digit is converted to its decimal value, which is added to `decimal_integer`.\n- The `fib` array is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1. The remaining 95 Fibonacci numbers are computed and stored in the `fib` array using a dynamic programming approach.\n- The `fib_number` variable is initialized to 0 and is used to store the first Fibonacci number that is greater than or equal to the decimal integer. The `fib` array is iterated over and the first number that is greater than or equal to `decimal_integer` is assigned to `fib_number`.\n- The function returns `True` if the decimal integer is divisible by `fib_number`; otherwise, it returns `False`.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730617870, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=844, prompt_tokens=183, total_tokens=1027))
