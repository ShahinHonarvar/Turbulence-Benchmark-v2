The function should convert the binary representation to its corresponding decimal integer, which can be done by using the `int` function with the base set to 2.\n\nTo determine if the decimal integer is divisible by the 120th number in the Fibonacci sequence, the function should calculate the 120th number in the sequence using the Binet's formula. The Binet's formula is given by the following equation:\n\n`F_n = (phi^n - psi^n) / sqrt(5)`\n\nwhere `phi` is the golden ratio and `psi` is its opposite. The golden ratio can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n`phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2`\n\nThe function should then calculate the 120th number in the Fibonacci sequence using the Binet's formula and check if the decimal integer is divisible by it.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_representation):\n    decimal_integer = int(binary_representation, 2)\n    phi = (1 + 5**0.5) / 2\n    psi = (1 - 5**0.5) / 2\n    fibonacci_120 = (phi**120 - psi**120) / 5**0.5\n    if decimal_integer % fibonacci_120 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThe function `if_decimal_is_divisible` takes a binary representation of a non-negative decimal integer as an argument and returns `True` if the corresponding decimal integer is divisible by the 120th number in the Fibonacci sequence, otherwise `False`. It uses the Binet's formula to calculate the 120th number in the Fibonacci sequence and checks if the decimal integer is divisible by it.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730617710, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=501, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=685))
