From the text specification, we know that we need to write a function called `if_decimal_is_divisible` that takes one argument, a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer. In the given binary representation, the most significant digit appears first. The function should return `True` if the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 118th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it should return `False`. The first number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence is 0.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_representation: str) -> bool:\n    decimal_integer = int(binary_representation, 2)\n    fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1]\n    for _ in range(117):\n        fibonacci_sequence.append(fibonacci_sequence[-1] + fibonacci_sequence[-2])\n    return decimal_integer % fibonacci_sequence[118] == 0\n```\n\nThe `if_decimal_is_divisible` function takes a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer as input and returns `True` if the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 118th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function first converts the binary representation string to a decimal integer using the `int()` function with the `base` parameter set to `2`. Then, it calculates the 118th number in the Fibonacci sequence using a loop that updates the sequence as we go. Finally, it uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the decimal integer is divisible by the 118th number in the Fibonacci sequence. If the remainder is 0, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730618072, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=566, prompt_tokens=184, total_tokens=750))
