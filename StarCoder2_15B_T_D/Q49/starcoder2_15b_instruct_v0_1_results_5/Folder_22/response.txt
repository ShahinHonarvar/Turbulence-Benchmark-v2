Extract the key information from the text specification:\n   - "binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer": This indicates that the input will be a string representing a non-negative decimal integer in binary format.\n   - "20th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence": This indicates that you need to find the 20th number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n   - "divisible by the 20th number in the Fibonacci sequence": This indicates that you need to check if the decimal integer corresponding to the binary representation string is divisible by the 20th number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. Determine the required Python function:\n   - "function called \'if_decimal_is_divisible\'": This indicates that you need to create a Python function called `if_decimal_is_divisible`.\n   - "take one argument": This indicates that the function should take one argument.\n   - "return true if the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 20th number in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it should return false": This indicates that the function should return `True` if the decimal integer is divisible by the 20th number in the Fibonacci sequence, and `False` otherwise.\n3. Generate the Python code:\n   - "Python code should not contain any comments": This indicates that the generated Python code should not include any comments.\n   - "Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks": This indicates that the generated Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere\'s how you can create the Python code according to the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_representation):\n    """\n    Check if a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer is divisible by the 20th number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n    """\n    decimal_integer = int(binary_representation, 2)\n    fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, 20):\n        fibonacci_sequence.append(fibonacci_sequence[i - 1] + fibonacci_sequence[i - 2])\n    if decimal_integer % fibonacci_sequence[19] == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730618315, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=521, prompt_tokens=183, total_tokens=704))
