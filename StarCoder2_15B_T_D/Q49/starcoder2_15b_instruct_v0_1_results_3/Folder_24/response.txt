ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we need to first understand the binary representation of the given number and how it is related to the decimal number. Then, we can use the fact that the 56th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 158907, which is divisible by 56. We can check if the given number is divisible by 56 by converting it to decimal and checking if the decimal representation is divisible by 56.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the solution:\n```python\ndef if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_representation):\n    decimal_number = int(binary_representation, 2)\n    return decimal_number % 56 == 0\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730616446, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=157, prompt_tokens=183, total_tokens=340))
