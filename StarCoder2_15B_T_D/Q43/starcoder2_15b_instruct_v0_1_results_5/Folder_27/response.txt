If it's not divisible by any number, it's a prime number.\n\nThe list comprehension iterates through the list of numbers and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function. It also checks if the index of the number is between 11 and 11, both inclusive. The resulting list is sorted and returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730589702, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=276, prompt_tokens=159, total_tokens=435))
