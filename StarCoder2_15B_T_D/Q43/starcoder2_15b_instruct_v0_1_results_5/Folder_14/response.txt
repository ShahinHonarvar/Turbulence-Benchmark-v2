You can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers in a range. The function should return the sorted list of prime numbers.\n\nHere's how you could implement the function using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(numbers):\n    is_prime = [True] * len(numbers)\n    for i in range(2, int(len(numbers) ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            for j in range(i * i, len(numbers), i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n    primes = []\n    for i in range(10, 67):\n        if is_prime[i] and numbers[i] > 1:\n            primes.append(numbers[i])\n    primes.sort()\n\n    return primes\n```\n\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm works by iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the length of the list. For each number, it marks its multiples as not prime (by setting their corresponding indices in the `is_prime` list to `False`). This helps avoid iterating through the entire list for each number, improving efficiency.\n\nThe function then iterates through the numbers from index 10 to index 66 and checks if they are prime (by checking if their corresponding indices in the `is_prime` list are `True` and if they are greater than 1). It adds the prime numbers to the `primes` list and sorts the list in ascending order.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730589571, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=381, prompt_tokens=159, total_tokens=540))
