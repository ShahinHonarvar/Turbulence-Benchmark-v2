Create a function that determines if a number is prime. A number is prime if it is not divisible by any number other than itself or 1.\n2. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and filters out the prime numbers.\n3. Call the filter function with a list of numbers from 459 to 781 and return the result.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, num):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef find_primes_between_indices(nums):\n    result = []\n    for num in nums:\n        if is_prime(num):\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n\nnums = list(range(459, 782))\nprimes = find_primes_between_indices(nums)\n```\n\nThe `is_prime` function checks if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the number itself. If it is not divisible by any number, it is prime.\n\nThe `find_primes_between_indices` function takes a list of numbers and iterates through it, calling the `is_prime` function on each number. If the number is prime, it is added to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned.\n\nIn the end, we create a list of numbers from 459 to 781 and call the `find_primes_between_indices` function with it. The result is a list of prime numbers from index 459 to index 781.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730587338, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=395, prompt_tokens=161, total_tokens=556))
