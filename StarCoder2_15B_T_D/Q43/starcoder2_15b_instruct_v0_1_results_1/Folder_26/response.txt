We can use the slicing feature of Python lists to extract the required sublist from the given list.\n\nHere is the Python code that fulfills the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(numbers):\n    """Find the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 23 to index 48, both inclusive."""\n    sublist = numbers[23:50]\n    primes = []\n    for num in sublist:\n        is_prime = True\n        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_prime:\n            primes.append(num)\n    return sorted(primes)\n```\n\nThis function `find_primes_between_indices` takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 23 to index 48, both inclusive. It first extracts the required sublist from the given list using list slicing. It then iterates over the sublist and checks if each number is prime by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to its square root. If it is prime, it is added to the `primes` list. Finally, the `primes` list is sorted and returned as the result.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730585896, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=333, prompt_tokens=159, total_tokens=492))
