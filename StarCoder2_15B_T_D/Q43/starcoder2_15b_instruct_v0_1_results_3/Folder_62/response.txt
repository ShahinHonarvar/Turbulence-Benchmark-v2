Define a function called `find_primes_between_indices` that takes one argument, a list of integers.\n2. Create an empty list to store the prime numbers.\n3. Iterate through the list of integers and check if each integer is a prime number.\n4. If the integer is a prime number, add it to the list of prime numbers.\n5. Sort the list of prime numbers in descending order.\n6. Return the list of prime numbers.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(numbers):\n    primes = []\n    for i, number in enumerate(numbers):\n        if i < 29 or i > 97:\n            continue\n        is_prime = True\n        for j in range(2, number):\n            if number % j == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_prime:\n            primes.append(number)\n    primes.sort(reverse=True)\n    return primes\n```\n\nThis implementation defines a function called `find_primes_between_indices` that takes a list of integers as an argument. It iterates through the list and checks if each integer is a prime number by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to itself. If it is a prime number, it is added to the list of prime numbers. The list of prime numbers is then sorted in descending order and returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730588117, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=328, prompt_tokens=159, total_tokens=487))
