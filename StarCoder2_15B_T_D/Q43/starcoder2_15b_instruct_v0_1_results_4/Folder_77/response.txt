Understand the text specification\nThe text specification provides detailed instructions on how to write a function called `find_primes_between_indices` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 287 to index 928, both inclusive, in ascending order.\n\n2. Write the function\nThe function `find_primes_between_indices` should take a list of integers as an argument and return the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 287 to index 928, both inclusive, in ascending order.\n\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(numbers):\n    primes = []  # List to store prime numbers\n    for number in numbers:  # Iterate over the list of integers\n        is_prime = True  # Assume the number is prime\n        for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):  # Check for divisibility\n            if number % i == 0:\n                is_prime = False  # Number is not prime\n                break\n        if is_prime and 287 <= numbers.index(number) <= 928:\n            primes.append(number)  # Add prime number to the list\n\n    return sorted(primes)  # Return the sorted list of prime numbers\n```\n\n3. Determine the range of indices to search for prime numbers\nThe function `find_primes_between_indices` takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 287 to index 928, both inclusive, in ascending order.\n\n4. Create a list of all prime numbers within the specified range\nThe function iterates over the list of integers and checks each number for divisibility by all numbers smaller than its square root. If the number is not divisible by any number smaller than its square root, it is considered a prime number.\n\n5. Sort the list of prime numbers in ascending order\nThe function uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the list of prime numbers in ascending order.\n\n6. Return the sorted list of prime numbers\nThe function returns the sorted list of prime numbers from index 287 to index 928, both inclusive.\n\n7. Write tests to ensure the function works as expected\nTo ensure the function works as expected, we can write tests that check the prime numbers in the specified range and the order of the returned list.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730589239, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1100, prompt_tokens=161, total_tokens=1261))
