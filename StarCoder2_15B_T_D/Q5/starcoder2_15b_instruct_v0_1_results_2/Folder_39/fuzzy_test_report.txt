Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[312, 130, -26, -240, -105, 341, 513, -88, 442, 91, 531, 454, 12, 448, -275, -217, 401, -440, -26, 5, 450, -209, -264, 252, 438, -73, 202, 281, 121, -31, -266, 283]


The correct answer was:

[-209, -264, -73, -31, -266]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
