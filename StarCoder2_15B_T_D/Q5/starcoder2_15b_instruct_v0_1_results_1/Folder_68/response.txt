Identify the function name and parameters: The function name is 'all_neg_ints_inclusive' and it takes a single parameter, a list of integers.\n2. Understand the task: The task is to return a list of all negative integers from index 0 to index 8, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n3. Write the Python code: Here's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_neg_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    result = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if num < 0 and i >= 0 and i <= 8:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the list of integers using a for loop. For each integer, it checks if it is negative and if its index is within the specified range. If both conditions are met, the integer is added to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.\n\nNote that the function does not contain any comments and is delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nThe triple backticks (```) are used to delimit the code block. They indicate that the code is written in Python and should not be treated as a comment. The function name, 'all_neg_ints_inclusive', and the parameter, 'nums', are defined in the code. The function takes a single parameter, a list of integers, and returns a list of all negative integers from index 0 to index 8, both inclusive.
