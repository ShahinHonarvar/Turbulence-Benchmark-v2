Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[44, 184, 52, -26, -112, 113, 8, -275, 333, 105, 438, -209, -198, 281, 345, -88, 404, 454, -431, -240, -288, 12, 476, -61, 283, 241, -217, 5, 335, 442, 510, -26, 252, -462, 202, -264, 513, -58, -8, 121, 83, 130, 450, 74, 341, 53, -340, -73, 56, -535, 407, 227, -266, 448, 91, 514, -193, 312, 96, 401, 531, -282, -549, -105, -127, -440, -31, 357]


The correct answer was:

[-193, -282, -549, -105, -127, -440, -31]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
