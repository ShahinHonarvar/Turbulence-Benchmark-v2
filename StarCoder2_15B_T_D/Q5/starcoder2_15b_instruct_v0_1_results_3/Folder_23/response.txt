If it is, we add it to the result list. To ensure that we only consider the range from 52 to 71, we can use a counter variable that starts at 0 and is incremented after each element is checked. We keep track of the counter and add the element to the result list only if the counter is between 52 and 71.\n\nHere is the Python code, delimited by triple backticks:\n\n```python\ndef all_neg_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    result = []\n    counter = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if num < 0 and 52 <= counter <= 71:\n            result.append(num)\n        counter += 1\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730473367, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=193, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=341))
