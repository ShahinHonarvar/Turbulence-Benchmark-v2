Define a function called `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` with one parameter, `numbers`, which is a list of integers.\n2. Initialize a variable called `sum_divisible` to 0. This variable will store the sum of all integers divisible by either -6 or 4 from index 0 to index 1.\n3. Use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the `numbers` list.\n4. Inside the for loop, check whether the current element is divisible by either -6 or 4. You can use the modulo operator (%) to check if the element is divisible by a particular number.\n5. If the current element is divisible by either -6 or 4, add it to `sum_divisible`.\n6. After the for loop, return `sum_divisible`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(numbers):\n    sum_divisible = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % -6 == 0 or num % 4 == 0:\n            sum_divisible += num\n    return sum_divisible\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730510309, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=319, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=476))
