Check if the list is empty. If it is, return 0 immediately.\n2. Iterate through the list, keeping track of the index using a for loop.\n3. Check if the current integer is divisible by either -1 or 13 using the modulo operator (%).\n4. If the integer is divisible by either -1 or 13, add it to a running total.\n5. Return the running total once the loop is complete.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):\n    total = 0\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if num % -1 == 0 or num % 13 == 0:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the list of integers, checking if each integer is divisible by either -1 or 13. If it is, it is added to a running total. The running total is returned once the loop is complete. If the list is empty, the function returns 0 immediately.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730510938, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=303, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=461))
