Create an empty list to store the integers divisible by either 67 or 15.\n2. Iterate through the given list of integers.\n3. For each integer, check if it is divisible by either 67 or 15.\n4. If it is divisible by either 67 or 15, add it to the list of integers.\n5. After iterating through the entire list, sum the integers in the list and return the result.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function with Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(ints_list):\n    ints_div_by_either = []\n    for i in range(len(ints_list)):\n        if i >= 46 and i <= 91 and (ints_list[i] % 67 == 0 or ints_list[i] % 15 == 0):\n            ints_div_by_either.append(ints_list[i])\n    return sum(ints_div_by_either)\n```\n\nThe `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all the integers in the list that are divisible by either 67 or 15 and are located between indices 46 and 91, inclusive. The function iterates through the list of integers and checks if each integer is divisible by either 67 or 15 using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is, the integer is added to the list of integers divisible by either 67 or 15. After iterating through the entire list, the function sums the integers in the list and returns the result.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730509938, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=426, prompt_tokens=161, total_tokens=587))
