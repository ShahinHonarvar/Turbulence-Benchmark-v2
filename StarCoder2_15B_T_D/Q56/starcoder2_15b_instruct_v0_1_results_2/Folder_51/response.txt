In this case, you want to find all substrings of length 96, which means that the substring must be 96 characters long.\n\nTo iterate over a string, you can use a for loop or the built-in `enumerate()` function. The `enumerate()` function returns a tuple containing the index and the character at that index for each iteration.\n\nTo check if a substring has no duplicate characters, you can use a set to store the characters that have already been seen. If the length of the set is less than the length of the substring, it means that there was at least one duplicate character.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `all_substring_of_size_n` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    substrings = []\n\n    for i in range(len(s) - 95):\n        substring = s[i:i+96]\n        if len(set(substring)) == len(substring):\n            substrings.append(substring)\n\n    return substrings\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the string, taking substrings of length 96. For each substring, it checks if it has no duplicate characters by converting it to a set and comparing the length of the set to the length of the substring. If they are equal, it means there are no duplicate characters, and the substring is added to the `substrings` list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730667797, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=380, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=546))
