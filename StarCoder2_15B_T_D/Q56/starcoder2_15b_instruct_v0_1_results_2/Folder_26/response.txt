Extract the substring length from the text specification: In the given text specification, we are instructed to return all distinct substrings of length 33. We can extract this value as a variable `substring_length` for later use.\n2. Define the function: We define a function called `all_substring_of_size_n` that takes a single argument `string` and returns a list of all distinct substrings of length `substring_length` with no duplicate characters.\n3. Generate all substrings: We can use a nested loop to generate all substrings of length `substring_length` from the given `string`. The outer loop iterates over all possible starting indices, and the inner loop iterates over all possible ending indices.\n4. Check for duplicates: We use a set to store the distinct substrings we encounter. If a substring has already been added to the set, we ignore it.\n5. Return the list of distinct substrings: We can return the list of distinct substrings by converting the set to a list.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\nsubstring_length = 33\n\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(string):\n    distinct_substrings = set()\n    for start in range(len(string) - substring_length + 1):\n        for end in range(start + substring_length, len(string) + 1):\n            substring = string[start:end]\n            if len(set(substring)) == substring_length:\n                distinct_substrings.add(substring)\n    return list(distinct_substrings)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a nested loop to generate all substrings of length `substring_length` from the given `string`. The outer loop iterates over all possible starting indices, and the inner loop iterates over all possible ending indices. For each substring, we check if it has no duplicate characters by comparing the length of the substring to the length of the set of its characters. If they are equal, it means that the substring has no duplicate characters, and we add it to the set of distinct substrings. Finally, we return the list of distinct substrings by converting the set to a list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730667567, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=501, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=667))
