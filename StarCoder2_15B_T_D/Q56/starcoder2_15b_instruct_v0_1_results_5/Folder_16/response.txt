The problem requires you to find all distinct substrings of length 124 with no duplicate characters in a given string. The substrings should be distinct, meaning they should be unique and not repeated.\n\nHere's how you can write the Python code that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    n = 124\n    substrings = set()\n    for i in range(len(s) - n + 1):\n        substring = s[i:i+n]\n        if len(substring) == len(set(substring)):\n            substrings.add(substring)\n    return list(substrings)\n```\n\nThe code starts by setting the substring length `n` to 124. It then iterates through the given string `s` and extracts substrings of length `n`. It checks if the substring contains duplicate characters by comparing the length of the substring with the length of the set of its characters. If there are no duplicates, the substring is added to the `substrings` set. Finally, the code returns the list of all distinct substrings found.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730669926, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=260, prompt_tokens=167, total_tokens=427))
