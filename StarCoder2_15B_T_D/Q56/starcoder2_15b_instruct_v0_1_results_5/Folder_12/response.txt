Extract the text specification: The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets and provides a clear instruction for the Python function. In this case, the specification states that the function should return the list of all distinct substrings of the length equal to 47 with no duplicate characters.\n2. Break down the specification into small steps: The specification can be broken down into smaller steps, such as finding all substrings of a given length, checking for duplicates, and returning the result as a list.\n3. Write the Python code: The Python code should be concise and efficient, without any unnecessary comments or explanations. It should be delimited only by triple backticks to ensure that it is properly formatted.\n\nHere's the Python code that follows the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(string):\n    substrings = []\n    n = 47\n    for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):\n        substring = string[i:i+n]\n        if len(set(substring)) == n:\n            substrings.append(substring)\n    return substrings\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as input and returns a list of all distinct substrings of length `n` (in this case, 47) with no duplicate characters. The function iterates over all possible substrings of the given string, checks if each substring has no duplicate characters, and adds it to the list of substrings if it meets the criteria. Finally, it returns the list of substrings.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730669889, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=338, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=504))
