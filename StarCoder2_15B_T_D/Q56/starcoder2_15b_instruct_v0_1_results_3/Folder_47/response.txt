We can achieve this by using a sliding window approach. The sliding window will move over the string, and for each window, we will check if it satisfies the criteria. If so, we will add it to the result list.\n\nHere's how we can implement this using Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    result = []\n    n = 91\n    for i in range(len(s) - n + 1):\n        window = s[i:i+n]\n        if len(window) == len(set(window)):\n            result.append(window)\n    return result\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a sliding window of size `n` to iterate over the string. For each window, we check if it satisfies the criteria by comparing the length of the window to the length of the set of its characters. If they are equal, it means that the window has no duplicate characters, and we add it to the result list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730668564, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=243, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=409))
