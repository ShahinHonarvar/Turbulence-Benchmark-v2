Extract the text specification: The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets. We need to extract the text specification from the given instruction.\n2. Understand the requirement: The requirement is to write a function called `all_substring_of_size_n` that takes one argument which is a string. The function should return the list of all distinct substrings of the length equal to 36 with no duplicate characters. If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function should return an empty list. The order of the substrings in the returned list does not matter.\n3. Create the Python code: We will create the Python code according to the requirement. The Python code should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the requirement:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(string):\n    substrings = []\n    n = 36\n    for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):\n        substring = string[i:i+n]\n        if len(substring) == n and len(set(substring)) == n:\n            substrings.append(substring)\n\n    return substrings\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The function `all_substring_of_size_n(string)` takes one argument, `string`, which is a string.\n- The variable `substrings` stores the list of all distinct substrings of the length equal to `n` with no duplicate characters.\n- The variable `n` stores the length of the substring.\n- The for loop iterates over the string, starting from index 0 to `len(string) - n + 1`.\n- Inside the loop, we extract the substring of length `n` starting from index `i`.\n- We check if the length of the substring is equal to `n` and if it contains no duplicate characters by comparing the length of the substring with the length of the set of the substring.\n- If both conditions are met, we add the substring to the `substrings` list.\n- Finally, we return the `substrings` list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730668681, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=475, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=641))
