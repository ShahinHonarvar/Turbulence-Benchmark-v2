The sliding window will move over the string, extracting substrings of length 30 one at a time. To check if a substring is valid (i.e., contains no duplicate characters), you can use a set to keep track of the characters seen so far. If the set's size is 30, it means all characters are unique and the substring is valid.\n\nHere's how you can write the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    n = 30\n    substrings = []\n    for i in range(len(s) - n + 1):\n        window = s[i:i+n]\n        if len(set(window)) == n:\n            substrings.append(window)\n\n    return substrings\n```\n\nThe `all_substring_of_size_n` function takes a string as input and returns a list of all distinct substrings of length 30 with no duplicate characters. The function uses a sliding window approach to extract substrings from the input string. For each window, it checks if all characters are unique by adding them to a set. If the set's size is 30, it means all characters are unique and the substring is valid. The valid substrings are added to the `substrings` list, and the function returns the list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730666672, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=303, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=469))
