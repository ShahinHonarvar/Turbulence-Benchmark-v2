The function name is 'all_substring_of_size_n', which suggests that it should return all substrings of a given length. The argument is a string, so we can use string slicing to extract substrings of a specific length. The length of the substrings should be 8, which is specified in the text specification. Additionally, the substrings should have no duplicate characters, which means they should be distinct. Finally, the function should return an empty list if no such substrings exist in the given string.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    n = 8  # length of substrings\n    substrings = set()  # use a set to store distinct substrings\n    for i in range(len(s) - n + 1):\n        substring = s[i:i+n]\n        if len(substring) == len(set(substring)):\n            substrings.add(substring)\n    return list(substrings)\n```\n\nThe code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the given string and extract substrings of length `n`. It uses a `set` to store distinct substrings. The `if` condition checks if the substring contains duplicate characters by comparing the length of the substring to the length of the set of characters in the substring. If there are no duplicates, the substring is added to the `set` of substrings. Finally, the code returns the list of substrings by converting the `set` to a `list`.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730669512, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=352, prompt_tokens=165, total_tokens=517))
