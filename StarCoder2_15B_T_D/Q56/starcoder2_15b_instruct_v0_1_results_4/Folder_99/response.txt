The problem is to find all distinct substrings of length 110 with no duplicate characters in a given string. The substrings should be distinct, meaning that they should be unique and not repeated.\n\nHere's the code that meets the specification:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(string):\n    substrings = []\n    for i in range(len(string)-109):\n        substring = string[i:i+110]\n        if len(set(substring)) == len(substring):\n            substrings.append(substring)\n    return substrings\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a for loop to iterate over all possible substrings of length 110 in the given string. For each substring, we check if it contains no duplicate characters by comparing the length of the substring with the length of the set of its characters. If they are equal, it means that the substring contains no duplicate characters, and we add it to the list of substrings. Finally, we return the list of substrings.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730669790, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=241, prompt_tokens=167, total_tokens=408))
