Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[91, -26, -266, 283, -209, -240, 454, -549, 438, 130, -264, 442, 184, -26, -88, 357, -31, -217, -8, 401, -440, 121, 202, -73, 341, -535, 12, 241, 531, 53, 5, 335, 312, 513, 448, 404, -275, -112, 281, -105, 252, 450]


The correct answer was:

[531, 53, 5, 335, 513, -275, 281, -105]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
