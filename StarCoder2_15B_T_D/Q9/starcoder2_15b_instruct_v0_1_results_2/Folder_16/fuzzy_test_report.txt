Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-107, -505, 157, -492, 370, 362, -421, -358, 417, -309, -506, 346, -341, -102, 464, -488, -28, 336, 314, -5, -78, 465, 449, 43, -73, 530, -546, -82, -532, 230, -96, -498, -121, 100, 248, 227, 391, -491]


The correct answer was:

[227, 391]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
