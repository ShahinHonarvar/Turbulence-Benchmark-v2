Define the function `find_largest_num(nums)` with one parameter, `nums`, which is a list of numbers.\n2. Create a variable `largest` and assign it to the first element of the list, `nums[0]`.\n3. Create a `for` loop that iterates over the elements of the list, `nums`, from index 15 to index 39, both inclusive.\n4. Inside the loop, check if the current element is greater than `largest`. If it is, assign the current element to `largest`.\n5. After the loop, return the `largest` element.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_num(nums):\n    largest = nums[0]\n    for i in range(15, 40):\n        if nums[i] > largest:\n            largest = nums[i]\n    return largest\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the elements of the list, `nums`, from index 15 to index 39, both inclusive, and checks if each element is greater than the current `largest` element. If an element is greater than `largest`, it is assigned to `largest`. At the end of the loop, the function returns the `largest` element.\n\nNote that you can also use the built-in function `max()` to find the maximum element in a list:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_num(nums):\n    return max(nums[15:40])\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the built-in function `max()` to find the maximum element in the specified range of the list, `nums`.\n\nThe function `find_largest_num(nums)` takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the largest element from index 15 to index 39, both inclusive. It iterates over the elements of the list from index 15 to index 39, both inclusive, and checks if each element is greater than the current largest element. If an element is greater than the current largest element, it is assigned to the `largest` variable. At the end of the loop, the function returns the `largest` element, which is the largest element from index 15 to index 39, both inclusive.\n\nHere's an example of how you can test the function:\n\n```python\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]\nassert find_largest_num(nums) == 40\nnums = [100, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 91, 90, 89, 88, 87, 86, 85, 84, 83, 82, 81, 80, 79, 78, 77, 76, 75, 74, 73, 72, 71, 70, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61]\nassert find_largest_num(nums) == 90\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730490124, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=906, prompt_tokens=125, total_tokens=1031))
