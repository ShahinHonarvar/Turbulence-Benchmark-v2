Define a function called `find_largest_num` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of numbers.\n2. Inside the function, create a variable `largest` and set it to the first element of the list `nums`.\n3. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the list `nums` from index 31 to 34, both inclusive.\n4. Inside the loop, compare the current element with the variable `largest`. If the current element is larger than `largest`, update `largest` to the current element.\n5. After the loop, return the value of `largest`.\n6. Outside the function, use triple backticks to delimit the Python code.\n\nHere's how we can implement this using Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_num(nums):\n    largest = nums[0]\n    for i in range(31, 35):\n        if nums[i] > largest:\n            largest = nums[i]\n    return largest\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we define a function called `find_largest_num` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of numbers. We initialize a variable `largest` and set it to the first element of the list `nums`. Then, we use a `for` loop to iterate over the list `nums` from index 31 to 34, both inclusive. Inside the loop, we compare the current element with the variable `largest`. If the current element is larger than `largest`, we update `largest` to the current element. After the loop, we return the value of `largest`, which is the largest element from index 31 to 34, both inclusive.
