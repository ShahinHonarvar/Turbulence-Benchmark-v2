Identify the function name and its arguments: The function name is 'find_largest_num' and it takes a single argument, a list of numbers.\n2. Understand the task: The function is supposed to find the largest element from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive, from a list of numbers.\n3. Write the Python code: You can write the Python code to find the largest element from index 90 to index 200 using the following steps:\n   - Define the function 'find_largest_num' that takes one argument, 'numbers', which is a list of numbers.\n   - Slice the 'numbers' list to extract the elements from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive.\n   - Use the built-in function'max' to find the largest element from the sliced list.\n   - Return the largest element.\n4. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. You can use the triple backticks to delimit the Python code.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code based on the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_num(numbers):\n    sliced_list = numbers[90:201]\n    largest_num = max(sliced_list)\n    return largest_num\n```\n\nThe Python code defines a function called 'find_largest_num' that takes a single argument, 'numbers', which is a list of numbers. The function slices the 'numbers' list to extract the elements from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive, and then finds the largest element from the sliced list using the built-in function'max'. Finally, the function returns the largest element.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730490959, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=396, prompt_tokens=126, total_tokens=522))
