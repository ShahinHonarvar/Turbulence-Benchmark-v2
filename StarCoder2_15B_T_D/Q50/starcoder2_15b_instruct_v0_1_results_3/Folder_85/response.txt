If the canonical form is already in the `anagrams` dictionary, the string is added to the list of values for that canonical form. Otherwise, a new key-value pair is created with the canonical form as the key and the string as the first value in the list.\n- The function returns `True` if there are at least 73 pairs of anagrams in the list, where each pair consists of two strings that are anagrams of each other. The `filter` function is used to filter out the canonical forms that have a length less than 3, and the `len` function is used to count the number of remaining canonical forms.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730621756, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=381, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=547))
