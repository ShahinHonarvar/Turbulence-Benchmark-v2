Loop through the list of strings and convert each string to lowercase.\n2. Create a dictionary to store the anagrams. The keys will be sorted strings and the values will be lists of strings that are anagrams of each other.\n3. Loop through the list of strings again and sort each string. Then, check if the sorted string is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, append the original string to the list associated with the key. Otherwise, create a new key-value pair with the sorted string as the key and the original string as the value.\n4. Loop through the values of the dictionary and check if any of the lists have a length of at least three. If so, add 1 to a `count` variable for each list that meets this condition.\n5. At the end of the function, return `True` if `count` is greater than or equal to 85, and `False` otherwise.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(strs):\n    lowercase_strs = [s.lower() for s in strs]\n    anagrams = {}\n    for s in lowercase_strs:\n        sorted_s = "".join(sorted(s))\n        if sorted_s in anagrams:\n            anagrams[sorted_s].append(s)\n        else:\n            anagrams[sorted_s] = [s]\n    count = 0\n    for anagram_list in anagrams.values():\n        if len(anagram_list) >= 3:\n            count += 1\n    return count >= 85\n```\n\nThe function `if_contains_anagrams` takes a list of strings as an argument and returns `True` if there are at least 85 pairs of anagrams in the list. It converts all strings to lowercase and then loops through the list of strings to find anagrams. Anagrams are stored in a dictionary where the keys are sorted strings and the values are lists of strings that are anagrams of each other. The function then checks if any of the lists in the dictionary have a length of at least three and adds 1 to a `count` variable for each list that meets this condition. Finally, it returns `True` if `count` is greater than or equal to 85, and `False` otherwise.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730620042, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=550, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=716))
