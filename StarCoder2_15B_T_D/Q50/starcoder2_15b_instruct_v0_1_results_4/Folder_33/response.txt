ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='An anagram is a word or phrase that is formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. In this instruction, you are asked to create a Python function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns `True` if there are at least 140 pairs of anagrams in the list; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function should only consider anagrams of length at least three and should compare strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere is how you could implement such a function:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(strings):\n    anagrams = set()\n    for word in strings:\n        word = word.lower() # Convert word to lowercase\n        if len(word) >= 3: # Only consider anagrams of length at least three\n            sorted_word = "".join(sorted(word)) # Sort the letters of the word\n            if sorted_word in anagrams:\n                return True # Return True if an anagram is found\n            anagrams.add(sorted_word)\n    return False # Return False if no anagrams were found\n```\n\nThe function `if_contains_anagrams` takes a list of strings as an argument. It iterates over each word in the list, converts it to lowercase, and sorts the letters of the word. If the sorted word is already in the `anagrams` set, it means there is an anagram in the list. If the sorted word is not in the `anagrams` set, it adds it to the set. Finally, the function returns `True` if an anagram is found, or `False` if no anagrams were found.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730622205, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=358, prompt_tokens=167, total_tokens=525))
