Extract the text specification: Extract the text specification from the given instruction. In this case, it is "Write a function called \'if_contains_anagrams\' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 98 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner."\n\n2. Write the Python code: Write the Python code based on the extracted text specification. In this case, it is to write a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return `true` if there are at least 98 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return `false`. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\n3. Ensure that the Python code follows the specifications: Verify that the Python code follows the specifications in the text specification.\n\n4. Delimit the Python code with triple backticks: Delimit the Python code with triple backticks to indicate the start and end of the Python code.\n\nHere\'s how you can write the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(strings):\n    anagrams = {}\n    for s in strings:\n        key = \'\'.join(sorted(s.lower()))\n        if len(s) >= 3:\n            if key in anagrams:\n                anagrams[key].append(s)\n            else:\n                anagrams[key] = [s]\n    return len(anagrams) >= 98\n```\n\nThis function first creates a dictionary to store the anagrams. It then iterates over the given list of strings and checks if each string is an anagram. An anagram is defined as a string that has the same characters as another string, regardless of their order. The function checks if the string has at least three characters, and if so, it adds it to the dictionary with the sorted characters as the key.\n\nFinally, the function checks if there are at least 98 pairs of anagrams in the dictionary by checking if the length of the dictionary is greater than or equal to 98. If there are, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730622825, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=542, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=708))
