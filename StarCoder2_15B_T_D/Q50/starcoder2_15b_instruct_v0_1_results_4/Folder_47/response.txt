It creates a dictionary to store the anagrams and their canonical forms. The canonical form of a string is the string after sorting its characters in ascending order. For example, the canonical form of "cat" is "act". The function then checks if the canonical form of a string is already in the dictionary. If it is, the string is added to the list of anagrams for that canonical form; otherwise, a new list is created for the canonical form and the string is added to it. The function then counts the number of pairs of anagrams in the dictionary by iterating over the canonical forms. A pair of anagrams is counted if the number of anagrams for a canonical form is at least 3. The function returns `True` if the number of pairs of anagrams is at least 47; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThe function `if_contains_anagrams` takes a list of strings as an argument.
