It achieves this by first creating groups of anagrams by sorting each string and placing them in a dictionary. The dictionary maps the sorted string to a list of strings that are anagrams of each other. Next, it iterates over the anagram groups and checks if the length of any group is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it means there are at least 2 pairs of anagrams in the group. Finally, it checks if the length of any of the strings in the group is at least 3, indicating that it is an anagram of length at least 3. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns True, indicating that there are at least 276 pairs of anagrams of length at least three in the list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730622681, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=419, prompt_tokens=167, total_tokens=586))
