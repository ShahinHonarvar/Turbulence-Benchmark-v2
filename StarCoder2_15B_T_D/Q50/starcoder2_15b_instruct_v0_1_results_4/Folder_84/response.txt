It then creates an empty dictionary called `anagrams`. The function then iterates over each string in the list and sorts its characters alphabetically. If the sorted string is already in the `anagrams` dictionary, it appends the original string to the list associated with that key. Otherwise, it creates a new list with the original string as its only element and associates it with the sorted string as the key.\n\nFinally, the function returns `True` if there are at least 108 pairs of anagrams in the list, and `False` otherwise. It does this by summing the length of each list in the `anagrams` dictionary and subtracting 1 from it. If the total is at least 108, there are at least 108 pairs of anagrams in the list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730622707, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=366, prompt_tokens=167, total_tokens=533))
