The function creates a dictionary where the keys are the canonical forms of the strings and the values are the number of times each canonical form appears in the list. It then checks if there are at least 65 keys in the dictionary with a value of at least 2, indicating that there are at least 65 pairs of anagrams in the list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730622121, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=307, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=473))
