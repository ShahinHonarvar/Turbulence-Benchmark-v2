ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code according to the text specification, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Parse the specification and extract the information: In this case, the specification states that we need to write a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a list of strings as an argument. The function should return `true` if there are at least 52 pairs of anagrams in the list; otherwise, it should return `false`. An anagram is a word or phrase that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, such as "cinema" and "iceman". The function should only consider anagrams of length at least three.\n\n2. Translate the specification into Python code: We can use Python\'s built-in functions and data types to implement the function. For example, we can use lists, dictionaries, and sets to store and organize the strings, and use string manipulation functions to compare and check for anagrams.\n\n3. Write the Python code without any comments: The Python code should be clear and concise, without any unnecessary comments. Comments can be distracting and make the code less readable.\n\n4. Delimit the Python code using triple backticks: To indicate the start and end of the Python code, we can use triple backticks to delimit the code block. This is a common convention in documentation and code sharing platforms, such as GitHub and Stack Overflow.\n\nHere\'s an example of how we can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(strings):\n    anagrams = {}\n    for string in strings:\n        key = "".join(sorted(string.lower()))\n        if len(string) >= 3:\n            if key in anagrams:\n                anagrams[key].append(string)\n            else:\n                anagrams[key] = [string]\n    return len(anagrams) >= 52\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730621977, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=400, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=566))
