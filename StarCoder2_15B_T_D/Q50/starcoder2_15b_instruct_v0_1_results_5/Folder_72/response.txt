ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="Based on the instruction, we want to write a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns `True` if there are at least 55 pairs of anagrams in the list, otherwise it should return `False`. The function should only consider anagrams of length at least three and should compare strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nTo achieve this, we can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Create a new function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a list of strings as an argument.\n2. Within the function, create a new list called `filtered_words` to store the filtered words of length at least three.\n3. Iterate over the input list of strings and for each string, check if it is of length at least three. If it is, add it to the `filtered_words` list.\n4. Create a new list called `sorted_words` to store the sorted versions of the words in `filtered_words`.\n5. Iterate over the `filtered_words` list and for each word, create a sorted version of the word and add it to the `sorted_words` list.\n6. Create a dictionary called `word_counts` to store the counts of each sorted version of a word.\n7. Iterate over the `sorted_words` list and for each sorted version of a word, increment its count in the `word_counts` dictionary.\n8. Create a new list called `anagram_counts` to store the counts of each anagram in the list.\n9. Iterate over the `word_counts` dictionary and for each key-value pair, if the count of the sorted version of a word is greater than or equal to 55, add the count to the `anagram_counts` list.\n10. Return `True` if the length of the `anagram_counts` list is greater than or equal to 55, otherwise return `False`.\n11. Test the function with various lists of strings and verify that it returns the correct result.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(words):\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if len(word) >= 3]\n    sorted_words = [sorted(word.lower()) for word in filtered_words]\n    word_counts = {}\n    for word in sorted_words:\n        word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1\n    anagram_counts = [count for count in word_counts.values() if count >= 55]\n    return len(anagram_counts) >= 55\n```\n\nThe function `if_contains_anagrams` takes a list of strings as an argument and returns `True` if there are at least 55 pairs of anagrams in the list, otherwise it returns `False`. The function filters the list to only include words of length at least three, sorts the words in a case-insensitive manner, counts the sorted versions of the words, and returns `True` if there are at least 55 pairs of anagrams in the list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730623514, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=687, prompt_tokens=166, total_tokens=853))
