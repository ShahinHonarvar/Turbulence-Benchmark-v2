It creates an empty dictionary called `anagrams`. It then loops through each string in the list, converts it to lowercase, sorts its letters, and concatenates them into a key. It checks if the key is already in the dictionary. If it is, it appends the string to the list associated with that key. If the key is not in the dictionary, it creates a new key-value pair with the key and a list containing the string. It then loops through the keys in the dictionary and checks if the length of the list associated with each key is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, it returns True. If the length of the list associated with any key is less than 3, it returns False.\n\nThe function `if_contains_anagrams` checks if there are at least 115 pairs of anagrams in the given list of strings. It does this by grouping anagrams together using a dictionary, where the keys are the sorted strings and the values are the list of strings that are anagrams of each other. It only considers anagrams of length at least three, and it compares the strings in a case-insensitive manner. The function returns True if there are at least 115 pairs of anagrams, and False otherwise.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730623672, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=384, prompt_tokens=167, total_tokens=551))
