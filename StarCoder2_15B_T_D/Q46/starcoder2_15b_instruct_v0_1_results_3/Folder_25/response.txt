Extract the elements at indices 32, 54, and 13 from the list.\n2. Find the greatest common factor of the three elements using a loop or a built-in function.\n3. Return the greatest common factor as the output of the function.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `gcf_three_nums` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    num1 = nums[32]\n    num2 = nums[54]\n    num3 = nums[13]\n    gcf = num1  # Initialize the GCF to the first element\n    for i in range(2, min(num1, num2, num3) + 1):\n        if num1 % i == 0 and num2 % i == 0 and num3 % i == 0:\n            gcf = i\n    return gcf\n```\n\nIn the `gcf_three_nums` function:\n- The function takes a list of positive integers as an argument.\n- It extracts the elements at indices 32, 54, and 13 from the list.\n- It finds the greatest common factor of the three elements by checking divisibility by all numbers smaller than or equal to the smallest element.\n- It returns the greatest common factor as the output of the function.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730601166, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=352, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=483))
