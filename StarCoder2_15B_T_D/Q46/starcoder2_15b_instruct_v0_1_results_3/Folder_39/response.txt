Write a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of positive integers.\n2. Inside the function, extract the elements at indices 85, 36, and 54 using list indexing.\n3. Write a helper function called `gcd` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n4. Write a helper function called `lcm` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns the least common multiple of the two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = a * b // gcd(a, b)`.\n5. Write a helper function called `lcm_multiple` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of numbers, and returns the least common multiple of all the numbers in the list using the `lcm` function and a `reduce` operation.\n6. Calculate the greatest common factor of the three numbers by taking the least common multiple of the three numbers and dividing the product of the three numbers by the least common multiple.\n7. Return the greatest common factor as the output of the `gcf_three_nums` function.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    a = nums[85]\n    b = nums[36]\n    c = nums[54]\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b!= 0:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\n    def lcm_multiple(nums):\n        from functools import reduce\n        return reduce(lcm, nums)\n\n    lcm_abc = lcm_multiple([a, b, c])\n    return lcm_abc // a // b // c\n```\n\nThe `gcf_three_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as input and extracts the elements at indices 85, 36, and 54. It then calculates the greatest common factor of the three numbers by taking the least common multiple of the three numbers and dividing the product of the three numbers by the least common multiple. The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, and the `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = a * b // gcd(a, b)`. The `lcm_multiple` function calculates the least common multiple of multiple numbers using the `lcm` function and a `reduce` operation.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730601285, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=630, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=761))
