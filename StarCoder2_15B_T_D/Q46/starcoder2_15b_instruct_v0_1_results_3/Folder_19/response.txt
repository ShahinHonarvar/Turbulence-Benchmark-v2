Define a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of positive integers.\n2. Inside the function, retrieve the elements at indices 40, 15, and 99 using list slicing.\n3. Use the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to find the greatest common factor of the three elements.\n4. Return the result of the `reduce` function.\n5. Outside the function, use triple backticks to delimit the Python code.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    a, b, c = nums[40], nums[15], nums[99]\n    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y // math.gcd(x, y), [a, b, c])\n```\n\nThe `reduce` function takes a function and a list as arguments and applies the function repeatedly to the elements of the list, reducing the list to a single value. In this case, the function is a lambda function that uses the `math.gcd` function to find the greatest common factor of two numbers. The `reduce` function is used to find the greatest common factor of the three elements at indices 40, 15, and 99.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730601082, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=358, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=489))
