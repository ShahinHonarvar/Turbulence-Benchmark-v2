Extract the code from the text specification. In this case, the code is `gcf_three_nums`.\n2. Generate Python code that meets the requirements. In this case, the code should:\n    - Define a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers.\n    - Extract the elements at indices 7, 6, and 8 from the list.\n    - Calculate the greatest common factor of the extracted elements.\n3. Format the code properly. In this case, the code should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n4. Test the code to ensure it meets the requirements.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    """\n    Returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 7, 6, and 8 in a list of positive integers.\n    """\n    num_1 = nums[7]\n    num_2 = nums[6]\n    num_3 = nums[8]\n    gcf = num_1\n\n    while gcf!= num_2 and gcf!= num_3:\n        gcf -= 1\n\n    return gcf\n```\n\nThis function extracts the elements at indices 7, 6, and 8 from a list of positive integers and calculates the greatest common factor of the extracted elements. The function iteratively decrements the first element until it finds a number that is divisible by both the second and third elements, which is the greatest common factor.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730601409, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=352, prompt_tokens=128, total_tokens=480))
