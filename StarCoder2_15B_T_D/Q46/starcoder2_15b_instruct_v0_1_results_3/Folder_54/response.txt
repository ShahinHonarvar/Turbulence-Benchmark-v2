Then, it finds the smallest of these numbers (the greatest common factor of all of them) and checks if it is the greatest common factor by dividing it into all three numbers. The loop continues until it finds the greatest common factor.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730601370, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=258, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=389))
