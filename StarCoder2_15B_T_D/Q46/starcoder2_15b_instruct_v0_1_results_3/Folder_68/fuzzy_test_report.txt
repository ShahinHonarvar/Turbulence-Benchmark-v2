Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[9326, 1034, 4180, 1932, 8118, 7365, 7738, 6220, 3440, 7994, 465, 6387, 7091, 9953, 35, 7298, 4364, 3749]


The correct answer was:

2

But the LLM code returned:
1

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

[7579, 4206, 2589, 5113, 4049, 7838, 3033, 4766, 5834, 8269, 2282, 4618, 2290, 1554, 4105, 8726, 9862, 2408]
