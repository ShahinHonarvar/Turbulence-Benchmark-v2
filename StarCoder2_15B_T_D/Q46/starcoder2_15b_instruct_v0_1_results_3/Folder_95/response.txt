From the text specification, we know that we need to write a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 87, 20, and 36.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    gcf = nums[87]\n    for i in range(86, 19, -1):\n        if nums[i] < gcf:\n            gcf = nums[i]\n    return gcf\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we start by initializing the `gcf` variable to the value of the element at index 87. Then, we loop from index 86 to 20, and for each index, we check if the element at that index is less than `gcf`. If it is, we update `gcf` to the value of the element at that index. Finally, we return the `gcf` value.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730601633, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=243, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=374))
