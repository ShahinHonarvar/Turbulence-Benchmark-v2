The instruction states that we are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets and we need to create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nThe text specification states that we need to create a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 20, 35 and 74.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `gcf_three_nums`:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    num_20 = nums[20]\n    num_35 = nums[35]\n    num_74 = nums[74]\n    gcf = num_20\n    for i in range(2, min(num_20, num_35, num_74) + 1):\n        if num_20 % i == 0 and num_35 % i == 0 and num_74 % i == 0:\n            gcf = i\n    return gcf\n```\n\nThe function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 20, 35 and 74. It does this by first extracting the elements at indices 20, 35 and 74 from the list. Then it finds the greatest common factor of these elements by dividing them by all the numbers from 2 to the minimum of the three elements.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730602033, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=358, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=489))
