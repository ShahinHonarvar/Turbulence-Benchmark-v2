Define a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of positive integers.\n2. Calculate the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 10, 55, and 36 using the `math.gcd` function, which returns the greatest common divisor of two or more integers.\n3. Return the calculated greatest common factor.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement this in Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return math.gcd(nums[10], nums[55], nums[36])\n```\n\nThis Python code defines a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of positive integers.
