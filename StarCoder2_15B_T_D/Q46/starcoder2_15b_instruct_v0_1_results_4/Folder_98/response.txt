The instructions say that we need to write a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 8, 2, and 1.\n\nThe greatest common factor (GCF) of three numbers is the largest positive integer that divides evenly into all three numbers. We can use the `math` module to find the GCF of two numbers using the `gcd` function.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `gcf_three_nums` according to the text specification:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    gcf_8_and_2 = math.gcd(nums[8], nums[2])\n    return math.gcd(gcf_8_and_2, nums[1])\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730602406, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=214, prompt_tokens=128, total_tokens=342))
