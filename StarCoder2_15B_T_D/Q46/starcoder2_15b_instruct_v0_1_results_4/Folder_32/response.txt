We start by assigning the elements at indices 20, 43, and 95 to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. Then, we implement the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCF of `a` and `b`. This is done by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one until the two numbers become equal. The GCF of `a` and `b` is then stored in the variable `a`. We then repeat the same process to find the GCF of `a` and `c`. The GCF of `a` and `c` is then returned as the result of the function.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730601907, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=255, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=386))
