It is a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of positive integers. The function returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 990, 671, and 711 in the list `nums`. The `gcd` function is used to calculate the greatest common factor of three numbers.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730602183, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=224, prompt_tokens=134, total_tokens=358))
