Read the text specification carefully to understand what the function is supposed to do.\n2. Extract the key information from the text specification, such as the function name, parameter name, and indices of the list elements.\n3. Write the Python function code that performs the desired function based on the extracted information.\n4. Ensure that the Python code conforms to the given specification, including the function name, parameter name, and the indices of the list elements.\n5. Remove any comments or unnecessary code from the Python function code.\n6. Enclose the Python function code within triple backticks to delimit the code block.\n\nHere's an example of how you can create Python code based on a given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    a = nums[25]\n    b = nums[76]\n    c = nums[57]\n    while b!= 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    gcd = a\n    while c!= 0:\n        gcd, c = c, gcd % c\n    return gcd\n```\n\nThis Python function, `gcf_three_nums`, takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 25, 76, and 57. The function first assigns the elements at those indices to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. It then uses Euclid's Algorithm to find the greatest common factor of `a` and `b`, and stores it in `gcd`. It then uses a modified version of Euclid's Algorithm to find the greatest common factor of `gcd` and `c`. Finally, it returns the greatest common factor of `a`, `b`, and `c`.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730602357, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=397, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=528))
