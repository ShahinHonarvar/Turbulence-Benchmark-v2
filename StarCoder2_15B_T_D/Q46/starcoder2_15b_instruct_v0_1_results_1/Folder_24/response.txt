The `gcf` function is a helper function that finds the greatest common factor of two numbers. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCF.\n\nThe `gcf_three_nums` function first calculates the GCF of the elements at indices 37 and 43 by calling the `gcf` function. Then, it passes the result and the element at index 18 to the `gcf` function to find the GCF of the three numbers.\n\nThe `gcf` function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCF of two numbers. It recursively calculates the GCF by dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. The GCF is the last non-zero remainder.\n\nThe Python code does not contain any comments because the text specification does not require them. The code is delimited only by triple backticks because the text specification does not require any other delimiters.\n\nThe instruction provided the following text specification:\n\n> Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 18, 37 and 43.\n\nTo satisfy this text specification, I created a Python function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 18, 37, and 43.\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCF of two numbers, which is implemented as a separate function called `gcf`.
