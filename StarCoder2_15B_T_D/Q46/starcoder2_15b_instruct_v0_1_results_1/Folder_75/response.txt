Then, it finds the minimum of the three numbers using the `min()` function and stores it in the variable `min_num`. Next, it iterates over all numbers from `min_num` to 1 in decreasing order and checks if each number is a divisor of all three numbers. If a number satisfies this condition, it means that it is the GCF of the three numbers and is returned as the result.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730600160, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=300, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=431))
