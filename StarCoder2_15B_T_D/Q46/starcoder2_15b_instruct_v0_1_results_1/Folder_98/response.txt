The instruction is to write a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 8, 2, and 1. The specification is to write the Python code without any comments and to use triple backticks to delimit the code.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(numbers):\n    return gcd(numbers[8], gcd(numbers[2], numbers[1]))\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use the `gcd` function from the `math` module to find the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 8, 2, and 1. The `gcd` function takes two arguments and returns the greatest common divisor of those two numbers. To find the greatest common factor of three numbers, we can use the `gcd` function repeatedly.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730600322, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=210, prompt_tokens=128, total_tokens=338))
