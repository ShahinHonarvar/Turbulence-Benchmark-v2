The function first extracts the elements at these indices and assigns them to variables a, b, and c, respectively. It then finds the smallest of these three elements (smaller) and iterates through all the numbers from smaller to 1. For each number, it checks if it is a common factor of all three numbers by checking if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0 and c % i == 0. If it is, it returns the common factor as the greatest common factor. If no common factor is found, it returns 1.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730600548, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=254, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=385))
