It then extracts the elements at indices 912, 170, and 500 and assigns them to variables a, b, and c, respectively.\n\nThe function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCF of a and b, storing it in the gcf variable. The Euclidean algorithm is a method to find the GCF of two numbers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one until they become equal.\n\nThe function then uses the Euclidean algorithm again to find the GCF of gcf and c. The GCF of the three numbers is then returned as the result of the function.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730600977, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=306, prompt_tokens=134, total_tokens=440))
