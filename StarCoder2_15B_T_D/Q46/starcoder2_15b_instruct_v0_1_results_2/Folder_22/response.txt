Read the text specification: Understand the problem described in the text specification. In this case, the problem is to write a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 27, 85 and 51.\n\n2. Break down the problem: Identify the key steps involved in solving the problem. In this case, the key steps are to calculate the greatest common factor of three numbers and to extract the elements at indices 27, 85 and 51 from a list.\n\n3. Write the code: Use Python syntax to implement the solution. Make sure to follow the specifications provided in the text specification. In this case, the specification is to write a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 27, 85 and 51.\n\n4. Test the code: Verify that the code meets the requirements specified in the text specification. You can use simple test cases to check that the function returns the correct output for different inputs. In this case, you can test the function with a list of positive integers and verify that it returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 27, 85 and 51.\n\n5. Delimit the code: Surround the code with triple backticks to indicate the start and end of the Python code.\n\nHere is an example of how you can create Python code based on a text specification:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    num1 = nums[27]\n    num2 = nums[85]\n    num3 = nums[51]\n    gcf = num1\n    for i in range(2, min(num2, num3) + 1):\n        if num2 % i == 0 and num3 % i == 0:\n            gcf = i\n    return gcf\n```\n\nThis function `gcf_three_nums` takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 27, 85 and 51. The function starts by extracting the elements at indices 27, 85 and 51 from the list. It then calculates the greatest common factor of the three numbers using a loop that iterates from 2 to the minimum of the two other numbers. The function returns the greatest common factor as the result.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730600492, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=561, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=692))
