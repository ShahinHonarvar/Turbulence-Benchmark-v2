This is because the function is only called with a list of positive integers, so the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 56, 88, and 51 will always be `nums[56]`.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730603098, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=199, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=330))
