We can apply this algorithm repeatedly until the remainder is zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the GCF.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    a = nums[20]\n    b = nums[35]\n    c = nums[74]\n    gcf = min(a, b, c)\n    while gcf!= 0:\n        if a % gcf == 0 and b % gcf == 0 and c % gcf == 0:\n            break\n        gcf -= 1\n\n    return gcf\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730602770, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=197, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=328))
