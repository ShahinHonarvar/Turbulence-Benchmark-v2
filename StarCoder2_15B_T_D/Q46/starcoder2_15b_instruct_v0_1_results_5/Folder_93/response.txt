The `reduce` function takes a function and a list and applies the function to the first two elements of the list, then applies the function to the result and the next element, and so on, until there is only one element left.\n\nIn our case, we want to find the greatest common factor of three numbers, so we can use the `reduce` function with the `gcd` function from the `math` module, which finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The `gcd` function is already defined in the `math` module, so we don't need to write it ourselves.\n\nHere's how we can implement this using `reduce` and `gcd`:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    return reduce(gcd, nums[25], nums[76], nums[57])\n```\n\nThe `reduce` function takes the `gcd` function as the first argument and the list of numbers as the remaining arguments. It applies the `gcd` function to the first two elements of the list, then applies the `gcd` function to the result and the next element, and so on, until there is only one element left. This is how we find the greatest common factor of the three numbers.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730603089, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=320, prompt_tokens=131, total_tokens=451))
