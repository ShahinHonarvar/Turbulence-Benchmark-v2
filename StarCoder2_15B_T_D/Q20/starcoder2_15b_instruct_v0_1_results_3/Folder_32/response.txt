In this case, the text specification says that we need to write a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 4th smallest number from index 59 to index 74, both inclusive.\n\nHere's how we can create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    sorted_nums = sorted(nums[59:75])\n    return sorted_nums[3]\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of distinct numbers. We then use the built-in `sorted` function to sort the list from index 59 to index 74, both inclusive. We then return the 4th smallest number from the sorted list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730517148, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=224, prompt_tokens=136, total_tokens=360))
