The instruction says that we need to write a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as an argument and returns the 10th smallest number from index 11 to index 24, both inclusive.\n\nThe instruction also specifies that the Python code should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    nums.sort()\n    return nums[10]\n```\n\nThe `find_n_th_smallest_num` function takes a list of distinct numbers as an argument and sorts them in ascending order. It then returns the 10th smallest number from the sorted list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730517122, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=193, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=330))
