The function should take a list of distinct numbers as input.\n2. The function should return the 10th smallest number from a given list.\n3. The function should be able to handle cases where the list is empty or the length of the list is less than 10.\n4. The function should be able to handle cases where the index range is out of bounds.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    sublist = nums[127:849]\n    sorted_sublist = sorted(sublist)\n    if len(sorted_sublist) >= 10:\n        return sorted_sublist[9]\n    else:\n        return None\n```\n\nThe function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 10th smallest number from index 127 to index 848, both inclusive. It handles cases where the list is empty or the length of the list is less than 10 by returning `None`. It also handles cases where the index range is out of bounds by making sure the sublist is within the bounds of the original list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730517231, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=329, prompt_tokens=139, total_tokens=468))
