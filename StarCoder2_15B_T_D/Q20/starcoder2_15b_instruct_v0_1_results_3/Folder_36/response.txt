Sort the list of distinct numbers in ascending order.\n2. Find the index of the 5th smallest number from index 291 to 312.\n3. Return the number at the found index.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n    index = 296\n    return sorted_nums[index]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 5th smallest number from index 291 to 312, both inclusive. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The function first sorts the list of distinct numbers in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.\n2. It then finds the index of the 5th smallest number from index 291 to 312 by adding 291 to the index of the 5th smallest number relative to the entire list (which is 4).\n3. Finally, it returns the number at the found index by accessing it from the sorted list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730517172, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=285, prompt_tokens=138, total_tokens=423))
