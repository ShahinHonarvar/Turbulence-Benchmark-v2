Here's how you can reason about this problem:\n\n1. Extract the relevant portion of the list: Since the input list is sorted, you can extract the relevant portion by slicing the list from index 32 to index 61, both inclusive. This will give you a sublist that contains the 14th smallest number.\n2. Find the 14th smallest number: You can find the 14th smallest number by sorting the sublist in ascending order and selecting the 14th element.\n3. Return the 14th smallest number: Return the 14th smallest number from the sorted sublist as the output of the function.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements the function `find_n_th_smallest_num`:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    sublist = nums[32:62]\n    sublist.sort()\n    return sublist[13]\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730516812, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=257, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=394))
