Parse the text specification: In this case, you are given a function specification that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 5th smallest number from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive.\n2. Generate the Python code: Based on the function specification, you need to write a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 5th smallest number from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive.\n3. Delimit the Python code: Since the text specification is surrounded by triple backticks, you need to delimit the Python code with triple backticks as well.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code based on the given text specification:\n\n```python\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n    return sorted_nums[4]\n```\n\nThe `find_n_th_smallest_num` function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 5th smallest number from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive. The function first sorts the list using the `sorted` function. Then, it returns the 5th element from the sorted list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730517511, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=293, prompt_tokens=134, total_tokens=427))
