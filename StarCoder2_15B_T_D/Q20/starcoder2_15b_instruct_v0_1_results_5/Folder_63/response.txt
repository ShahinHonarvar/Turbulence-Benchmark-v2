However, the instruction specifies that the list is a "list of distinct numbers", which means that there are no duplicate numbers in the list. This means that we can skip the sorting step and directly select the 5th smallest number from the list.\n\nHere\'s how you can write the Python code for the given instruction:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(input_list):\n    return sorted(input_list[33:40])[4]\n```\n\nThe `sorted()` function sorts the list in ascending order, so the 5th smallest number is at index 4. The `input_list[33:40]` slice selects the elements from index 33 to 39, both inclusive.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730518349, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=194, prompt_tokens=136, total_tokens=330))
