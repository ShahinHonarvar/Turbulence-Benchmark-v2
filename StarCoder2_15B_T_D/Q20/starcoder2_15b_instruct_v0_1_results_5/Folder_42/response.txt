The input is a list of distinct numbers, and the output is the 6th smallest number from index 58 to index 82, both inclusive.\n\nNext, we need to write the Python code to solve this problem. Here's how we can do it:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    return sorted_numbers[58:83][5]\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730518235, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=172, prompt_tokens=136, total_tokens=308))
