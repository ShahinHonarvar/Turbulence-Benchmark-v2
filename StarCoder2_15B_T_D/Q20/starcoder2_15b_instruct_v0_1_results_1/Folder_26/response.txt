Understand the instruction: The instruction specifies that the function should take a list of distinct numbers as input and return the 10th smallest number from index 11 to index 24, both inclusive.\n2. Create the function: The function should be named 'find_n_th_smallest_num', take a list of distinct numbers as input, and return the 10th smallest number from index 11 to index 24, both inclusive.\n3. Implement the function: The function should sort the list of distinct numbers, then select the 10th smallest number from index 11 to index 24, both inclusive.\n4. Test the function: The function should be tested with various input lists of distinct numbers to verify that it works correctly.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function 'find_n_th_smallest_num':\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n    return sorted_nums[10]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 10th smallest number from index 11 to index 24, both inclusive. The function first sorts the list of distinct numbers using the built-in `sorted` function. Then, it returns the 10th smallest number from the sorted list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730516121, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=315, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=452))
