In this case, the specification is to "insert character \'q\' immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'j\'".\n\nHere\'s how you could create Python code based on this text specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    """\n    Insert character \'q\' immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'j\'.\n    """\n    new_string = ""\n    for char in string:\n        new_string += char\n        if char == "j":\n            new_string += "q"\n    return new_string\n```\n\nThe Python code defines a function called `insert_after_character` that takes a string as an argument. It iterates through each character in the string and adds it to a new string. If the character is \'j\', the function adds \'q\' to the new string. The function returns the new string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730551491, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=205, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=335))
