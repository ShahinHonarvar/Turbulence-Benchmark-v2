In this case, the specification is to write a function called `insert_after_character` that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'H\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character\'\'.\n\nHere\'s how we can create Python code to implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    result = ""\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        result += c\n        if c == " ":\n            result += "H"\n    return result\n```\n\nThe code iterates through the string, checking for spaces. If a space is encountered, the character \'H\' is inserted immediately succeeding the space. The resulting string is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730551052, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=172, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=301))
