In this case, the specification is straightforward: Write a function called `insert_after_character` that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character `K` has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character `\' \'`.\n\nHere\'s how you could create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    """\n    Insert character \'K\' after any occurrences of character\'\' in the given string.\n    """\n    return string.replace(\' \', \'K\')\n```\n\nThis function uses the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of the character `\' \'` with the character `\'K\'`. The `replace` method returns a new string with the replacements made, which is then returned by the function.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730551121, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=182, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=311))
