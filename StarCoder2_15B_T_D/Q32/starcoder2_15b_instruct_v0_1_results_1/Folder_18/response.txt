This can be done using the `re.sub` function, which allows us to specify a regular expression pattern and a replacement string.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef insert_after_character(string: str) -> str:\n    """\n    Inserts the character \'l\' immediately succeeding any occurrences of the character \'K\' in the given string.\n    """\n    pattern = r\'K\'\n    replacement = r\'Kl\'\n    return re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a regular expression pattern `r\'K\'` to find all occurrences of the character \'K\' in the given string. The replacement string `r\'Kl\'` specifies that the character \'l\' should be inserted immediately succeeding each occurrence of \'K\'. The `re.sub` function is used to perform the replacement, and the resulting string is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730551106, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=232, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=362))
