The specification states that we need to write a function called `insert_after_character` that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'u\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'F\'.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    """Insert \'u\' after \'F\' in a string."""\n    result = \'\'\n    for char in string:\n        result += char\n        if char == \'F\':\n            result += \'u\'\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each character in the input string and appends it to the `result` string. If the character is \'F\', it also appends \'u\' to the `result` string. Finally, the function returns the `result` string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730553146, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=199, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=329))
