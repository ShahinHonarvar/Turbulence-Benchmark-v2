This function allows you to substitute a pattern with a replacement string in a given string. In this case, you can use the pattern 'O' to match any occurrences of the character 'O' in the input string, and use the replacement string 'OO' to insert the character 'O' after each occurrence.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    return re.sub('O', 'OO', string)\n```\n\nThe `re.sub` function takes three arguments: the pattern to match, the replacement string, and the string to search. In this case, the pattern is the character 'O', and the replacement string is 'OO', which inserts the character 'O' after each occurrence of 'O' in the input string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730553223, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=196, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=326))
