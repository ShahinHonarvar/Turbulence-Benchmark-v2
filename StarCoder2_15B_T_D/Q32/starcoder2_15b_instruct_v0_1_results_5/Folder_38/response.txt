ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create the Python code according to the text specification, we need to understand the text specification. The text specification states that we need to create a function called `insert_after_character` that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'6\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'X\'. This means that the function needs to find all occurrences of \'X\' in the input string and insert \'6\' immediately after each occurrence.\n\nHere\'s how we can create the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    """\n    Insert \'6\' after every occurrence of \'X\' in the input string\n    """\n    characters = list(string)\n    for i, c in enumerate(characters):\n        if c == \'X\':\n            characters.insert(i + 1, \'6\')\n    return \'\'.join(characters)\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730553188, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=198, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=328))
