ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the input string and insert the character \'U\' after every occurrence of \'S\'. To do this efficiently, we can use a list to store the characters of the output string and insert the character \'U\' after every occurrence of \'S\'.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(input_string: str) -> str:\n    """\n    Returns a string that is identical except that character \'U\' has been inserted\n    immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'S\'.\n    """\n    output_chars = []\n\n    for char in input_string:\n        output_chars.append(char)\n        if char == \'S\':\n            output_chars.append(\'U\')\n\n    return \'\'.join(output_chars)\n```\n\nThis implementation iterates through the input string and appends each character to the output list. If the current character is \'S\', the character \'U\' is also appended to the output list. Finally, the output list is joined into a string and returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730552249, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=228, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=358))
