Identify the requirement: The function `insert_after_character` is required to take a string as input and return a new string with the character 'K' inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character''.\n2. Create the function: Begin by creating an empty function definition for `insert_after_character`.\n3. Define the parameters: Specify the parameter(s) of the function, which in this case is a single string argument.\n4. Implement the logic: Use a loop to iterate through the input string and check for the presence of character''. If found, insert character 'K' immediately succeeding it.\n5. Return the result: Finally, return the modified string as the result of the function.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code that meets the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    result = ''\n    for char in string:\n        result += char\n        if char =='':\n            result += 'K'\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the input string and checks for the presence of character''. If found, it inserts character 'K' immediately succeeding it. The resulting string is returned as the result of the function.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730552609, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=279, prompt_tokens=129, total_tokens=408))
