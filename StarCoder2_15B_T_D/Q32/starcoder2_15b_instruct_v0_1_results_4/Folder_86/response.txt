The text specification states that we need to create a function called `insert_after_character` that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'Q\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'O\'.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    """\n    Insert a character after another character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The modified string with \'Q\' inserted after \'O\'.\n    """\n    modified_string = ""\n    for char in string:\n        modified_string += char\n        if char == \'O\':\n            modified_string += \'Q\'\n    return modified_string\n```\n\nThe function `insert_after_character` takes a string as an argument and returns a modified string where \'Q\' is inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of \'O\'. The function iterates over each character in the input string and appends it to the modified string. If the current character is \'O\', \'Q\' is also appended to the modified string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730552918, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=261, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=391))
