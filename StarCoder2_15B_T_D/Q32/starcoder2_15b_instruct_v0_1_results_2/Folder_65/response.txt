Iterate over each character in the input string: Use a for loop to iterate over the characters in the input string.\n2. Check if the current character is '6': Use an if statement to check if the current character is '6'.\n3. Insert '9' after the current character: When the current character is '6', insert '9' after it by concatenating the current character, '9', and the next character.\n4. Append the current character to the result string: If the current character is not '6', simply append it to the result string.\n5. Return the result string: After the loop, return the result string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    result = ''\n    for i in range(len(string) - 1):\n        if string[i] == '6':\n            result += '69'\n        else:\n            result += string[i]\n    result += string[-1]\n    return result\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730551833, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=264, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=394))
