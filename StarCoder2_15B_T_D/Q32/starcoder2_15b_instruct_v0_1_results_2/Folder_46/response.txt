The function name, \'insert_after_character\', suggests that it should insert a character after another character. The argument, a string, indicates that the function should work with strings. The character \'W\' should be inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'6\'.\n\nHere\'s how you could create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    """\n    Insert character \'W\' after character \'6\' in a string.\n    """\n    return string.replace(\'6\', \'6W\')\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with \'W\' inserted after every occurrence of \'6\'. The `replace` method is used to perform the substitution, replacing \'6\' with \'6W\'.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730551730, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=183, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=313))
