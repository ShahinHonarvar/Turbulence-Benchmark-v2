Define the function signature, which includes the function name, parameter name, and return type.\n2. Define the function body, which includes the logic for inserting the character \'o\' after each occurrence of character \'F\'.\n3. Define the function documentation, which includes a short description of what the function does and the expected input and output.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string: str) -> str:\n    """\n    Insert a character after each occurrence of another character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The modified string with the character \'o\' inserted after each occurrence of \'F\'.\n    """\n    result = ""\n    for char in string:\n        if char == "F":\n            result += char + "o"\n        else:\n            result += char\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function `insert_after_character` takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'o\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'F\'. The function iterates through each character in the input string, checks if the character is \'F\', and inserts \'o\' after it if it is. If the character is not \'F\', it is added to the result string as-is. The function then returns the result string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730551795, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=346, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=476))
