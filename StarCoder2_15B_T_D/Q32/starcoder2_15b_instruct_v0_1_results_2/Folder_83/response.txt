In this case, the function is supposed to insert the character \'e\' immediately succeeding any occurrences of the character \'E\' in a given string.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `insert_after_character`:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(string: str) -> str:\n    result = ""\n    for char in string:\n        if char == "E":\n            result += "Ee"\n        else:\n            result += char\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function `insert_after_character` takes a string as input and returns a new string with the character \'e\' inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of the character \'E\'. It iterates through each character in the input string and checks if it is equal to \'E\'. If it is, it appends both \'E\' and \'e\' to the result string. Otherwise, it appends the current character to the result string. Finally, it returns the resulting string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730551927, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=227, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=357))
