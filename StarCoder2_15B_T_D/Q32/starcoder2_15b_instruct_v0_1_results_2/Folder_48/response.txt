The specification says that you should write a function called `insert_after_character` that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character 'U' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character 'S'.\n\nTo implement this function, you can use Python's `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of 'S' in the input string with 'SU'.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code in accordance with the specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(s):\n    return s.replace('S', 'SU')\n```\n\nThe `replace()` method replaces all occurrences of the specified character in the input string with the desired character. In this case, the character is 'S', and the desired character is 'SU'.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730551748, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=182, prompt_tokens=130, total_tokens=312))
