If there is no such an element, the function should return `None`.\n\nYou said that the numbers in the list are distinct, which means they are all unique. This means that there will be no ties and the second smallest number will be unique as well.\n\nHere's how you could implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n    if len(sorted_nums) < 2 or len(sorted_nums) < 101:\n        return None\n    return sorted_nums[1]\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730499303, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=180, prompt_tokens=147, total_tokens=327))
