Docstrings are used to document a function\'s purpose, arguments, and return value. They are not considered as code and are ignored by the Python interpreter.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specifications:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n    """\n    Find the second smallest element from index 0 to index 2, both inclusive.\n    If there is no such an element, return \'None\'.\n    """\n    smallest = second_smallest = None\n    for num in nums[:3]:\n        if smallest is None or num < smallest:\n            smallest, second_smallest = num, smallest\n        elif second_smallest is None or num < second_smallest:\n            second_smallest = num\n    return second_smallest\n```\n\nThe code starts with a function definition. The docstring describes the function\'s purpose and what it returns. The function takes a list of distinct numbers as input. It then iterates through the list and finds the smallest and second smallest elements. If there is no second smallest element, it returns \'None\'.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730499822, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=251, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=396))
