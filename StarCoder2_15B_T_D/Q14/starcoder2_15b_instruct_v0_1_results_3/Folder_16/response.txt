In this case, the specification states that you need to write a function called `find_second_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 66 to index 77, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return `None`.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n    second_smallest = sorted_nums[66:78][1] if len(sorted_nums) > 77 else None\n\n    return second_smallest\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `find_second_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 66 to index 77, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function returns `None`. The code first sorts the list using the `sorted` function. Then, it slices the sorted list to obtain the elements from index 66 to index 77, both inclusive. If there are fewer than 77 elements in the list, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest element from index 66 to index 77.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730498494, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=303, prompt_tokens=147, total_tokens=450))
