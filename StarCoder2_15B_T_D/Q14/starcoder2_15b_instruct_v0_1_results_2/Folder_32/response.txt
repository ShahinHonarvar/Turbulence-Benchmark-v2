In this case, the function `find_second_smallest_num` is supposed to find the second smallest element from index 32 to 35, both inclusive, in a list of distinct numbers. If there is no such an element, the function should return `None`.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n    second_smallest = sorted_nums[32]\n    if second_smallest == sorted_nums[33]:\n        return second_smallest\n    else:\n        return None\n```\n\nWe first sort the list of numbers using the built-in `sorted` function. Then, we check if the element at index 32 is equal to the element at index 33. If they are equal, then the element at index 32 is the second smallest element from index 32 to 35. Otherwise, there is no such an element, and we return `None`.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730498015, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=247, prompt_tokens=147, total_tokens=394))
