In this case, the specification is to write a function called `all_left_truncatable_prime` that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 89. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.\n\nHere's how you could create Python code based on this specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_left_truncatable_prime(args):\n    numbers = args[0]\n    x = numbers[89]\n    left_truncatable_primes = []\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number < x and is_prime(number) and not contains_zero(number) and are_truncations_prime(number):\n            left_truncatable_primes.append(number)\n    left_truncatable_primes.sort(reverse=True)\n    return left_truncatable_primes\n\ndef is_prime(number):\n    if number < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if number % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef contains_zero(number):\n    return '0' in str(number)\n\ndef are_truncations_prime(number):\n    while number > 0:\n        if not is_prime(number):\n            return False\n        number //= 10\n    return True\n```\n\nThe `all_left_truncatable_prime` function takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument. It then extracts the integer at index 89 and assigns it to the variable `x`. It then iterates through each number in the tuple and checks if it is less than `x`, is prime, does not contain a 0, and all its truncations are prime. If all these conditions are met, the number is added to the `left_truncatable_primes` list. The list is then sorted in descending order and returned.\n\nThe `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by dividing it by all numbers less than its square root. The `contains_zero` function checks if a number contains a 0 by converting it to a string and checking if it contains the digit '0'. The `are_truncations_prime` function checks if all the truncations of a number are prime by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and checking if each result is prime.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730683116, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=594, prompt_tokens=185, total_tokens=779))
