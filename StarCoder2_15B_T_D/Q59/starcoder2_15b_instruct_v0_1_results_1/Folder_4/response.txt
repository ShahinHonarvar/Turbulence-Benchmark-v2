ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create the Python code according to the text specification, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Understand the text specification: The text specification states that we are asked to create a function called `all_left_truncatable_prime` that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 96. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.\n2. Break down the text specification into smaller parts: We can break down the text specification into smaller parts such as the function name, argument type, variable name, and return type.\n3. Determine the algorithm: After understanding the text specification, we can develop an algorithm to solve the problem. We know that we need to find all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. We can use a function to check if a number is a prime number, and then use another function to check if a number is left-truncatable. We can use a for loop to iterate through all numbers less than x and check if they are left-truncatable prime numbers.\n4. Write the Python code: We can write the Python code according to the algorithm we developed. We can use the function `is_prime` to check if a number is a prime number, and then use the function `is_left_truncatable` to check if a number is left-truncatable. We can use a for loop to iterate through all numbers less than x and check if they are left-truncatable prime numbers.\n5. Format the Python code: We can format the Python code to make it easier to read and understand. We can use proper indentation and spacing to make the code more readable. We can also use descriptive variable names and function names to make the code self-explanatory.\n6. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. We can use triple backticks to delimit the Python code.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\n\ndef is_left_truncatable(n):\n    s = str(n)\n    if '0' in s:\n        return False\n    for i in range(len(s) - 1):\n        if not is_prime(int(s[i:])):\n            return False\n    return True\n\n\ndef all_left_truncatable_prime(t):\n    x = t[96]\n    result = []\n    for i in range(2, x):\n        if is_left_truncatable(i):\n            result.append(i)\n    return sorted(result, reverse=True)\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730679792, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=684, prompt_tokens=185, total_tokens=869))
