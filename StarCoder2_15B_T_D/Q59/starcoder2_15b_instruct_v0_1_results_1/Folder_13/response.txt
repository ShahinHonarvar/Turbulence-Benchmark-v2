However, the text specification provided contains angle brackets (`<` and `>`), which are used to delimit HTML tags. To avoid parsing errors, we need to replace the angle brackets with HTML entities (`&lt;` and `&gt;`).\n\nAfter replacing the angle brackets, we can use the `exec` function to execute the text as Python code. In this case, the text specification is a function definition for `all_left_truncatable_prime`, which takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument and returns a list of left-truncatable prime numbers less than the integer at index 784.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```python\ntext_specification = "<Write a function called \'all_left_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 784. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.>"\n\ntext_specification = text_specification.replace("<", "&lt;").replace(">", "&gt;")\n\nexec(text_specification)\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730679937, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=307, prompt_tokens=186, total_tokens=493))
