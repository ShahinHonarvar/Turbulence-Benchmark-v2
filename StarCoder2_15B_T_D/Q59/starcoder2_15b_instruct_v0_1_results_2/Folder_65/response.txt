ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code according to the given text specification, we can use the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime and the `all_left_truncatable_prime` function to generate all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x.\n\nThe `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by looping through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, it is prime.\n\nThe `all_left_truncatable_prime` function takes a tuple of positive integers and returns a list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. Here, x is the integer at index 32. It starts by checking if x is a valid index in the tuple and if it is a prime number. Then, it loops through all the numbers from 2 to x and checks if they are left-truncatable prime numbers. To check if a number is left-truncatable prime, it removes the leading digit and checks if the resulting number is prime. If it is, it adds it to the list of left-truncatable prime numbers. Finally, it returns the sorted list of left-truncatable prime numbers.\n\nHere is how you can create Python code according to the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num > 1:\n        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if num % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):\n    if 32 in tup:\n        x = tup[32]\n        if is_prime(x):\n            left_truncatable_primes = []\n            for i in range(2, x):\n                num = i\n                while num > 0:\n                    if is_prime(num):\n                        left_truncatable_primes.append(i)\n                        break\n                    num //= 10\n            return sorted(left_truncatable_primes)\n    return []\n```\n\nThe `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by looping through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of them.
