Check if the two lists have the same size. If they do not, return an empty set.\n2. Create an empty set to store the elements that occur in both lists.\n3. Iterate over the elements in the first list between index 56 and 82, both inclusive.\n4. For each element, check if it occurs in the second list between index 56 and 82, both inclusive.\n5. If it does, add it to the set of elements that occur in both lists.\n6. Return the set of elements that occur in both lists.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    if len(list1)!= len(list2):\n        return set()\n\n    elements = set()\n\n    for i in range(56, 83):\n        if list1[i] in list2[56:83]:\n            elements.add(list1[i])\n\n    return elements\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730579602, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=276, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=430))
