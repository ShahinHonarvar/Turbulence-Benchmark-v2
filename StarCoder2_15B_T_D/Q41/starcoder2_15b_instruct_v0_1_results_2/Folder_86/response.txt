The function should return a set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 31 and 34, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the `identical_elements` function:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list_1, list_2):\n    return set(list_1[31:35]) & set(list_2[31:35])\n```\n\n[The `set` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set) is used to convert the sublists of `list_1` and `list_2` between indices 31 and 34, both inclusive, into sets. The `&` operator is used to find the intersection of these two sets, which returns a set of all elements that occur in both sets.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730579583, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=243, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=397))
