Check if the two lists are of the same size. If not, return an empty set.\n2. Create an empty set to store the elements that occur in both lists.\n3. Loop through the elements of the first list and check if they are present in the second list. If so, add them to the set.\n4. Return the set of elements that occur in both lists.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    if len(list1)!= len(list2):\n        return set()\n\n    elements = set()\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        if list1[i] in list2:\n            elements.add(list1[i])\n\n    return elements\n```\n\nThis implementation checks if the two lists are of the same size. If not, it returns an empty set. Otherwise, it loops through the elements of the first list and checks if they are present in the second list. If so, they are added to the set of elements that occur in both lists. Finally, the set is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730579639, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=280, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=434))
