We then use the `set` function to convert the sublists of each list between index 29 and index 51, both inclusive, into sets. We then use the `intersection` method to find the elements that occur in both sets.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730580806, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=213, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=367))
