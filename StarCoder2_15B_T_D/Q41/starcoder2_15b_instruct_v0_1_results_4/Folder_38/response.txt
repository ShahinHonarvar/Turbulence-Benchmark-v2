ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='You need to write a function called `identical_elements` that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 22 and index 63, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    if len(list1)!= len(list2):\n        raise ValueError("Lists must be of the same size.")\n\n    result = set()\n    for i in range(22, 64):\n        if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n            result.add(list1[i])\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function takes two lists as inputs and checks if they are of the same size. If they are not, it raises a `ValueError`. Otherwise, it iterates over the elements between index 22 and 63, both inclusive, and checks if they are identical in both lists. If they are, they are added to the result set. Finally, the result set is returned.\n\nNote that the function does not include any comments or docstrings, and the Python code is delimited only by triple backticks.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730580576, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=279, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=433))
