If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `identical_elements` function:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    set1 = set(list1[70:201])\n    set2 = set(list2[70:201])\n    return set1 & set2\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- `list1[70:201]` and `list2[70:201]` extract sublists from index 70 to index 200, both inclusive, from `list1` and `list2`, respectively.\n- `set1 = set(list1[70:201])` creates a set from the extracted sublist of `list1`.\n- `set2 = set(list2[70:201])` creates a set from the extracted sublist of `list2`.\n- `return set1 & set2` returns the intersection of `set1` and `set2`, which is the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 70 and index 200, both inclusive.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730580381, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=331, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=486))
