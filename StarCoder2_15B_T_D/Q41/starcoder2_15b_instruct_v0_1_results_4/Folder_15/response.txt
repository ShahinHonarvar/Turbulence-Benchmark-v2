Validate the input: Check that the two input lists are non-empty and have the same length.\n2. Initialize an empty set to store the common elements.\n3. Iterate over the elements in both lists using a `for` loop.\n4. For each element, check if it occurs in both lists anywhere between index 2 and index 2, both inclusive.\n5. If so, add the element to the set of common elements.\n6. Return the set of common elements.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    if len(list1) == 0 or len(list2) == 0 or len(list1)!= len(list2):\n        return set()\n    common_elements = set()\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        if list1[i] == list2[i] and 2 <= i <= 2:\n            common_elements.add(list1[i])\n\n    return common_elements\n```\n\nThis implementation checks that the two input lists are non-empty and have the same length. It then iterates over the elements in both lists and checks if they are the same and occur anywhere between index 2 and index 2, both inclusive. If so, it adds them to the set of common elements. Finally, it returns the set of common elements.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730580431, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=338, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=490))
