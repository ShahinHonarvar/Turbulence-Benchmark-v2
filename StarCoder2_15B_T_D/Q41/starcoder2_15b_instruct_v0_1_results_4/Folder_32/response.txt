If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere's how we can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    return set(list1[21:98]) & set(list2[21:98])\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments, `list1` and `list2`, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 21 and index 97, both inclusive. The function uses the set intersection operator (`&`) to find the common elements between the two sets created from the slices of the given lists. The slice notation `[21:98]` is used to extract the elements between index 21 and index 97, both inclusive.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730580537, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=239, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=393))
