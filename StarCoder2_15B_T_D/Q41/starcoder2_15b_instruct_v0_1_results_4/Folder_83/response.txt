The function should return the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 90 and index 200, both inclusive.\n2. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    set1 = set(list1[90:201])\n    set2 = set(list2[90:201])\n    return set1.intersection(set2)\n```\n\nThe `set()` function is used to create a set from the list elements between index 90 and index 200, both inclusive. The `intersection()` method is then used to find the common elements between the two sets.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730580886, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=204, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=359))
