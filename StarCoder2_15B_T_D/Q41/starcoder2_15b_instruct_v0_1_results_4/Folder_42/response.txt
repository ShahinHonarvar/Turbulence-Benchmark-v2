If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.\n\nYou can achieve this by using two for loops to iterate through each list and compare the elements at the specified indices. If an element is present in both lists at the specified indices, add it to the `result` set. Finally, return the `result` set.\n\nHere's how you can write the function:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    result = set()\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        if list1[i] == list2[i] and 29 <= i <= 79:\n            result.add(list1[i])\n    return result\n```\n\nNote that the function assumes the two lists are of the same size.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730580602, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=229, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=383))
