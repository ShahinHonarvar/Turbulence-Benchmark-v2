Understand the text specification: Read the text specification carefully to understand the requirements of the function.\n2. Extract information: Identify the function name, arguments, and return value from the text specification.\n3. Write Python code: Create the function in Python without using comments.\n4. Test the code: Test the function with different input values to ensure its correctness.\n\nHere\'s how you can create Python code based on the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list_1, list_2):\n    """Return the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 62 and 63, both inclusive. If no such elements exist, return an empty set."""\n\n    return set(list_1[62:64]) & set(list_2[62:64])\n```\n\nThe function `identical_elements` takes two arguments, `list_1` and `list_2`, which are assumed to be lists of the same size. It returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 62 and 63, both inclusive. If no such elements exist, the function returns an empty set.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730579871, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=280, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=434))
