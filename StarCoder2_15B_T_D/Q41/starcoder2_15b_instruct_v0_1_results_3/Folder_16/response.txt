If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.\n\nTo complete this task, you can use the `set` data structure to store the elements that occur in both lists. You can iterate through the elements of the lists and check if they occur in both lists using the `in` operator. If they occur in both lists, add them to the set.\n\nHere's how you can create the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    common_elements = set()\n    for i in range(33, 37):\n        if list1[i] in list2:\n            common_elements.add(list1[i])\n    return common_elements\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730579780, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=217, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=371))
