We can first check if the lengths of the two lists are equal. If they are not, we can return an empty set. Otherwise, we can slice the lists to extract the sublists between indexes 14 and 64, both inclusive. Then, we can create a set of all elements that occur in both sublists using the intersection operator (&). This set will contain all elements that occur in both lists anywhere between indexes 14 and 64.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    if len(list1)!= len(list2):\n        return set()\n    sublist1 = list1[14:65]\n    sublist2 = list2[14:65]\n    return set(sublist1) & set(sublist2)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first check if the lengths of the two lists are equal.
