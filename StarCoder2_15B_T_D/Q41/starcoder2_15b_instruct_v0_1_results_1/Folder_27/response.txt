Check if the lists are of the same size and return an empty set if they are not.\n2. Create an empty set to store the elements that occur in both lists.\n3. Iterate through the elements of both lists simultaneously.\n4. For each element, check if it occurs in both lists anywhere between index 66 and index 93, both inclusive.\n5. If it does, add it to the set of identical elements.\n6. Return the set of identical elements.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    if len(list1)!= len(list2):\n        return set()\n    identical_elements_set = set()\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        if list1[i] in list2[i] and 66 <= i <= 93:\n            identical_elements_set.add(list1[i])\n\n    return identical_elements_set\n```\n\nThis implementation checks if the given lists are of the same size and iterates through the elements of both lists simultaneously. It checks if each element occurs in both lists anywhere between index 66 and index 93, both inclusive, and adds it to the set of identical elements. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function returns an empty set.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730578652, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=351, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=505))
