The function should return the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 75 and index 85, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    """\n    Returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists\n    anywhere between index 75 and index 85, both inclusive.
