If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere is how you could write this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    set1 = set(list1[12:93])\n    set2 = set(list2[12:93])\n    return set1.intersection(set2)\n```\n\nThe `identical_elements` function takes two lists as arguments. It creates two sets, `set1` and `set2`, from the sublists of each list between index 12 and index 92, both inclusive. The function then returns the intersection of the two sets, which is the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 12 and index 92. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function returns an empty set.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730578508, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=247, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=401))
