Then, we find the intersection of these two sets using the `&` operator to get the elements that occur in both sets. Finally, we return this intersection as the result of the function.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730578990, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=206, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=360))
