The problem specification states that we need to find all contiguous sublists of a circular list of integers such that their product is equal to 537. This means that we need to iterate over the list and compute the product of each sublist. If the product equals 537, we need to add the sublist to the result list.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function 'lists_with_product_equal_n':\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    result = []\n    n = len(circular_list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n + i):\n            sublist = circular_list[i:j]\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n\n            if product == 537:\n                result.append(sublist)\n\n    return result\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730663621, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=230, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=468))
