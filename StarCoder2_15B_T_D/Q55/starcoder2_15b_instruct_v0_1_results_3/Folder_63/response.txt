Create a function with a parameter for the circular list and another for the target product.\n2. Iterate through the list to find sublists that have a product equal to the target product.\n3. Use a nested for loop to iterate through the list and find the sublists.\n4. Check if the product of the sublist is equal to the target product.\n5. Add the sublist to a list of sublists if it has the correct product.\n6. Return the list of sublists.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list, n):\n    sublists = []\n    for i in range(len(circular_list)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(circular_list) + i):\n            sublist = circular_list[i:j]\n            if len(sublist) == len(circular_list):\n                sublist = circular_list[i:] + circular_list[:j % len(circular_list)]\n            if len(sublist) > 0 and len(sublist) <= len(circular_list) and product(sublist) == n:\n                sublists.append(sublist)\n    return sublists\n\ndef product(numbers):\n    result = 1\n    for n in numbers:\n        result *= n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation uses nested for loops to iterate through the list and find all sublists. It checks if the product of the sublist is equal to the target product and adds it to the list of sublists if it is. It also handles circular lists by checking if the sublist is larger than the given list and adjusting it accordingly.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664213, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=412, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=649))
