We can iterate over the circular list and expand the window to find sublists whose product equals 49. We can use a variable to track the product of the sublist and multiply or divide by the element at each iteration. We can also use a variable to track the start index of the sublist.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef list_with_product_equal_n(lst, n):\n    product = 1\n    start = 0\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product *= lst[i]\n        while product > n:\n            product /= lst[start]\n            start += 1\n        if product == n:\n            result.append(lst[start:i + 1])\n\n    return result\n```\n\nIn the code, we iterate over the circular list using `range(len(lst))`. At each iteration, we multiply the product by the element at the current index. If the product is greater than `n`, we divide by the element at the start index and increment the start index. If the product equals `n`, we add the sublist from the start index to the current index to the result list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664174, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=268, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=505))
