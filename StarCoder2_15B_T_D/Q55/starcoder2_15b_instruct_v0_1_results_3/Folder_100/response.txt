This means that the first and last elements of the list are considered adjacent to each other. The function should return a list of sublists where each sublist has contiguous integers that multiply to 48. The size of each sublist can be any size as long as it is less than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates, they should all be included in the returned list. The order of the sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = 48\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        sublist = [lst[i]]\n        product = lst[i]\n        j = (i + 1) % len(lst)\n        while product < n and j!= i:\n            sublist.append(lst[j])\n            product *= lst[j]\n            j = (j + 1) % len(lst)\n        if product == n:\n            result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function iterates over the given list and considers each element as the starting point of a sublist. It then calculates the product of the elements in the sublist until it reaches the end of the list, wrapping around to the beginning if needed. If the product equals `n`, the sublist is added to the result.\n\nThe function returns a list of sublists where each sublist has contiguous integers that multiply to 48. If no such sublist exists, an empty list is returned. If there are duplicates, they are all included in the returned list.
