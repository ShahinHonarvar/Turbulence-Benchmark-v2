ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We can iterate through the given list, and for each index, we can expand the window to include contiguous integers that have a product of -26. We can use a variable to track the product of the integers in the window, and if the product equals -26, we can add the sublist to the result list.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    """\n    Returns a list of sublists of `nums` such that the product of the integers in each sublist is equal to -26.\n    """\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i + len(nums)):\n            index = j % len(nums)\n            product *= nums[index]\n            sublist.append(nums[index])\n            if product == -26:\n                result.append(sublist)\n            elif product == 0:\n                break\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `lists_with_product_equal_n` function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists. It iterates through the given list, and for each index, it expands the window to include contiguous integers that have a product of -26. If the product equals -26, it adds the sublist to the result list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664002, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=336, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=573))
