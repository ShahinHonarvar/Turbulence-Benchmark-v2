ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use a circular list algorithm and a sliding window approach. We can iterate through the list, keeping track of the product of the integers in the current window. If the product equals -56, we add the window to the result list. We can also use a hash table to store the products and their corresponding windows to avoid duplicate sublists.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    """\n    Returns a list of sublists of `nums` such that the product of the integers in each sublist\n    equals -56. Each sublist can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the\n    size of `nums`. If no such sublist exists, returns an empty list. If there are duplicates,\n    they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned\n    list does not matter.\n    """\n    result = []\n    product = 1\n    window = []\n    products = {}\n\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        product *= num\n        window.append(num)\n\n        if product == -56:\n            result.append(window[:])\n\n        if product in products:\n            for j in range(products[product], i):\n                del window[0]\n                product //= nums[j]\n            result.append(window[:])\n\n        products[product] = i\n\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664468, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=330, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=567))
