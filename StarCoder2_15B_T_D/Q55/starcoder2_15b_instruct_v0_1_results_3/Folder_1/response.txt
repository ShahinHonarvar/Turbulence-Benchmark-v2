The outer loop iterates over the list starting from the head, and the inner loop iterates over the list starting from the current index of the outer loop. The sublist is formed by appending the current element of the inner loop to a temporary list. The product is calculated by multiplying the current element of the inner loop to a temporary variable. If the product equals -51, the sublist is added to the result list. If the product becomes 0 or 1, it means that the product can no longer be -51, so the inner loop is broken. The outer loop continues to iterate over the list until all elements have been checked.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730663541, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=282, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=519))
