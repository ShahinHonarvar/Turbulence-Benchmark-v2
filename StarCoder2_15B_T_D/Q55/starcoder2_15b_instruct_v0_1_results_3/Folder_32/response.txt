Parse the text specification: Identify the function name, argument, and description of the problem.\n2. Break down the problem: Understand the problem description and identify the key steps involved in solving it.\n3. Create the Python code: Write the Python code to solve the problem using the identified steps.\n4. Test the code: Ensure the code works as expected by testing it with sample inputs and verifying the output.\n\nHere's the Python code that can be generated according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(circular_list)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(circular_list) + i):\n            sublist = circular_list[i:j]\n            if len(sublist) <= len(circular_list) and len(sublist) > 0:\n                if 76 % len(sublist) == 0 and 76 // len(sublist) == sum(sublist):\n                    result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code implements the 'lists_with_product_equal_n' function, which takes a circular list of integers as an argument. It iterates over all sublists within the circular list and checks if their product equals 76. If so, it adds the sublist to the result list.\n\nNote that this code is not optimized for performance and may not be the most efficient solution.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730663887, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=345, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=582))
