ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We can iterate through the given list and expand the window to include contiguous integers until the product of the integers in the window equals -46. If the product is equal to -46, we add the sublist to the result. If the product is greater than -46, we shrink the window by removing the leftmost element and continue expanding the window. If the product is less than -46, we increase the window size by adding the next element to the right. This process is repeated until the end of the list is reached.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    """\n    Returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list\n    such that their product equals -46. If no such sublist exists, an empty list is returned.\n    """\n    result = []\n    n = len(nums)\n    for i in range(n):\n        product = 1\n        left = i\n        right = i\n        while left < n and right < n:\n            product *= nums[right]\n            if product == -46:\n                result.append(nums[left:right + 1])\n            elif product < -46:\n                right += 1\n            else:\n                product //= nums[left]\n                left += 1\n\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730663964, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=324, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=561))
