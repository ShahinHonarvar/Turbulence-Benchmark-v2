ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, you need to understand the concept of a circular list, which is a list in which the head and tail are adjacent to each other. You also need to understand that the function should return a list of sublists, each of which contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -95.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `lists_with_product_equal_n`:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(list_of_ints):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(list_of_ints)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(list_of_ints) + 1):\n            if j - i > len(list_of_ints):\n                break\n            sublist = list_of_ints[i:j]\n            if len(sublist) <= len(list_of_ints) and 1 not in sublist and -95 % product(sublist) == 0:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n\ndef product(iterable):\n    return 1 if not iterable else iterable[0] * product(iterable[1:])\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- We iterate over all possible sublists of the given list using two nested loops, where the outer loop iterates over the starting index of the sublist and the inner loop iterates over the ending index of the sublist.\n- We use the `product` function to calculate the product of the integers in the sublist.\n- We check if the product of the integers in the sublist equals -95 and the length of the sublist is not greater than the length of the given list.\n- If the conditions are met, we add the sublist to the `result` list.\n- We return the `result` list at the end.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730663796, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=402, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=639))
