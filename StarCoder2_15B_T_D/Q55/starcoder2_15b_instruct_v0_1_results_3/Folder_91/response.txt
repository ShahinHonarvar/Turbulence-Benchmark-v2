The window size can vary from 1 to the size of the list. For each window size, you can use a nested loop to slide the window across the list and find the sublist that has a product equal to 2.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst, n):\n    result = []\n    for window_size in range(1, len(lst) + 1):\n        for i in range(len(lst)):\n            product = 1\n            sublist = []\n            for j in range(i, i + window_size):\n                index = j % len(lst)\n                product *= lst[index]\n                sublist.append(lst[index])\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation iterates through all possible window sizes from 1 to the size of the list and for each window size, it slides the window across the list and finds the sublist with a product equal to 2. If such a sublist is found, it is added to the `result` list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664493, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=265, prompt_tokens=236, total_tokens=501))
