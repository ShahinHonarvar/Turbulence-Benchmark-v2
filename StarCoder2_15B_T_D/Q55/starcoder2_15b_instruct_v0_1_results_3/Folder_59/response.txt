You also need to understand the requirement that the product of the integers in each sublist must be equal to -3.\n\nHere is how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = len(circular_list)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n + i):\n            sublist = circular_list[i:j]\n            if len(sublist) <= n and prod(sublist) == -3:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n\ndef prod(iterable):\n    return 1 if not iterable else iterable[0] * prod(iterable[1:])\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function takes a circular list as an argument and returns a list of sublists. It iterates over all possible sublists of the given list and checks if the product of the integers in the sublist equals -3. If it does, the sublist is added to the result.\n\nThe `prod` function is a recursive function that calculates the product of a list of integers. It returns 1 if the list is empty and otherwise multiplies the first element of the list with the product of the remaining elements.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664161, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=319, prompt_tokens=236, total_tokens=555))
