ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window technique. We can iterate through the given list and maintain a window of contiguous integers that have a product of -91. We can use a variable to track the product of the integers in the window and update it as we move the window forward. If the product equals -91, we have found a sublist that meets the criteria, so we add it to the result list.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    """\n    Returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list\n    such that their product equals -91.\n    """\n    result = []\n    n = len(nums)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        window = []\n        product = 1\n\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            index = j % n\n            window.append(nums[index])\n            product *= nums[index]\n\n            if product == -91:\n                result.append(window[:])\n\n            if product == 0:\n                break\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a sliding window technique to iterate through the given list. We maintain a window of contiguous integers and update the product of the window as we move forward. If the product equals -91, we have found a sublist that meets the criteria, so we add it to the result list. We also break the inner loop if the product becomes zero, as the product of any other integers will never be -91.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665477, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=354, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=591))
