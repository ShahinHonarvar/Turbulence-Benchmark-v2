The function takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -22. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe function iterates over the given list and for each index, it creates sublists by taking all the contiguous elements from the current index to the end of the list. It then checks if the product of the elements in the sublist is equal to -22 and adds it to the result if it is.\n\nThe function also handles the case where the sublist contains a single element. The function returns the list of sublists containing the desired product.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664616, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=331, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=568))
