ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to iterate through the given list. We can start with a window size of 1 and keep increasing it until we find a window that has a product equal to -46. We can use a circular list to handle the wrap-around scenario when the window extends past the end of the list.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    """\n    Returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list\n    such that their product equals -46.\n    """\n    n = len(nums)\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        window_size = 1\n        while window_size <= n:\n            for j in range(n):\n                prod = 1\n                for k in range(j, j + window_size):\n                    prod *= nums[k % n]\n                if prod == -46:\n                    result.append([nums[(j + k) % n] for k in range(window_size)])\n            window_size += 1\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible windows of different sizes. For each window, it calculates the product of the elements and checks if it equals -46. If so, it appends the corresponding sublist to the result. The circular list is handled by using the modulo operator to wrap around the indices.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664963, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=334, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=571))
