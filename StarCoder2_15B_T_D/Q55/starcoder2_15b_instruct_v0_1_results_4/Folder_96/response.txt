The function iterates through all possible sublists of the given list and checks if their product is equal to 0. If a sublist with product equal to 0 is found, it is added to the result list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665504, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=221, prompt_tokens=236, total_tokens=457))
