The sliding window will move forward one position at a time, expanding or shrinking as needed to find the contiguous sublists that have a product of -81.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function using the sliding window approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    """\n    Returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list\n    such that their product equals -81.\n    """\n    result = []\n    start = 0\n    end = 0\n    prod = 1\n\n    while end < len(nums):\n        prod *= nums[end]\n        while prod > -81:\n            prod /= nums[start]\n            start += 1\n\n        if prod == -81:\n            result.append(nums[start:end + 1])\n\n        end += 1\n\n    return result\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a sliding window to find the contiguous sublists that have a product of -81. The sliding window is controlled by two pointers, `start` and `end`, which represent the start and end of the current window. The `prod` variable tracks the product of the elements in the current window.\n\nThe `while` loop in the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function expands or shrinks the window as needed to find the contiguous sublists that have a product of -81. If the current window has a product of -81, we add it to the `result` list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664917, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=367, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=604))
