It first defines a helper function that recursively constructs the sublists and checks if their product is equal to 2. The helper function takes the following arguments:\n\n- `list_of_ints`: The original list of integers.\n- `sublist`: The sublist being constructed.\n- `product`: The product of the integers in the sublist.\n- `index`: The current index in the list being explored.\n- `n`: The target product.\n\nThe helper function returns a list of sublists that satisfy the given condition. If the product of the integers in the sublist equals `n`, it returns the sublist as a list. If the product exceeds `n` or the index exceeds the length of the list, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with two options:\n\n- Option 1: Add the current integer to the sublist and multiply the product by the current integer.\n- Option 2: Do not add the current integer to the sublist and move on to the next integer.\n\nThe `lists_with_product_equal_n` function then calls the helper function with the given list of integers, an empty sublist, a product of 1, an index of 0, and a target product of 2. It adds the given list to itself to make it circular, which allows the function to explore all possible sublists regardless of where the sublist starts in the list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665455, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=533, prompt_tokens=236, total_tokens=769))
