Loop through the list and check if the product of the current sublist equals -18.\n2. If the product equals -18, append the sublist to the result list.\n3. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list.\n4. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    sublist = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        sublist.append(lst[i])\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(len(sublist)):\n            product *= sublist[j]\n        if product == -18:\n            result.append(sublist.copy())\n        if i == len(lst) - 1:\n            sublist.pop(0)\n            i = -1\n    return result\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664709, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=268, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=505))
