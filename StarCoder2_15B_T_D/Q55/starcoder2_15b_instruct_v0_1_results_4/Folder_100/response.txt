This function should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you could do it:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    sublists = []\n    for i in range(len(circular_list)):\n        sublist = []\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, i + len(circular_list)):\n            sublist.append(circular_list[j % len(circular_list)])\n            product *= circular_list[j % len(circular_list)]\n            if product == 48:\n                sublists.append(sublist)\n                break\n            elif product > 48:\n                break\n    return sublists\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the circular list and checks every sublist starting from each index. The sublist is reset after each iteration. The product is calculated for each sublist and checked against 48. If the product is equal to 48, the sublist is added to the list of sublists. If the product is greater than 48, the loop is broken to move on to the next index. The function returns the list of sublists that have a product of 48.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665545, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=296, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=533))
