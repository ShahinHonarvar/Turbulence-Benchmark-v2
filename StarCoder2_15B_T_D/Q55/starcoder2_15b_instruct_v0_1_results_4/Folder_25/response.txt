Read the text specification carefully and understand what the function should do.\n2. Break down the task into smaller steps and craft a solution step by step.\n3. Write Python code to implement the solution.\n4. Test your code with various examples to verify its correctness.\n5. Remove any comments and format the code as desired.\n\nHere is how you could create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    n = -32\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n\n        for j in range(i, len(nums)):\n            product *= nums[j]\n            sublist.append(nums[j])\n\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n\n            if product < n:\n                continue\n            else:\n                break\n    return result\n```\n\nThe code above implements the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes a circular list of integers and returns a list of sublists that have a product of -32. It iterates over the list twice to find all possible contiguous sublists, calculates their product, and appends them to the result if the product is equal to -32. The `break` statement is used to exit the inner loop if the product becomes greater than -32, which implies that the remaining elements in the list cannot contribute to a product of -32.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730664828, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=335, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=572))
