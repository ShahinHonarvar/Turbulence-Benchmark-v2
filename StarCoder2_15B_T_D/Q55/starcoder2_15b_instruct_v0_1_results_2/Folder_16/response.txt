The sublists are checked for their product, and if it equals -837, they are appended to the `sublists` list. Finally, the `sublists` list is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730662680, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=257, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=495))
