It returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals `n`.\n- The function `prod` takes a list as an argument and returns the product of the elements in the list. This function is used to calculate the product of the elements in a sublist.\n- The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` iterates over the indices of the circular list. For each index, it iterates over all the indices from the current index to the index plus the length of the circular list. This ensures that all possible sublists starting at the current index and ending at any index are considered.\n- For each sublist starting at the current index and ending at any index, the function checks if the length of the sublist is greater than zero and less than or equal to the length of the circular list. If the length of the sublist is within the required range, the function checks if the product of the elements in the sublist equals `n`. If both conditions are satisfied, the sublist is added to the result list.\n- The function returns the result list, which contains all the sublists that satisfy the given conditions.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730663036, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=443, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=680))
