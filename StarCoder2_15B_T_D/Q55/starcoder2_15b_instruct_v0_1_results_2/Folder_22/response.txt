Iterate through the given list and keep track of the current product of the integers in the sublist.\n2. If the current product is equal to the given number, add the sublist to the result list.\n3. If the current product is greater than the given number, remove the first integer from the sublist and divide the current product by it.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until either the current product is equal to the given number or the sublist is empty.\n5. After iterating through the entire list, return the result list.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst, n):\n    result = []\n    sublist = []\n    product = 1\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        sublist.append(lst[i])\n        product *= lst[i]\n        while product > n and len(sublist) > 0:\n            product //= sublist.pop(0)\n        if product == n:\n            result.append(sublist[:])\n        if len(sublist) == 0:\n            product = 1\n            sublist = []\n    return result\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730662739, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=299, prompt_tokens=236, total_tokens=535))
