It returns a list of sublists of the given list such that their product is equal to `n`.\n\nThe function iterates over all possible sublists of the given list using nested `for` loops. For each sublist, it calculates its product by multiplying all the integers in the sublist. If the product is equal to `n`, the sublist is added to the `sublists` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `sublists` list, which contains all the sublists of the given list whose product is equal to `n`.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730662698, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=268, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=505))
