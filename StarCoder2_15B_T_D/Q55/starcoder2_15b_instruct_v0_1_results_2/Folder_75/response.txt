The index is wrapped around using `j % len(lst)` to handle the circular list.\n- The variable `current_product` is initialized to 1 and updated with each iteration of the inner loop to calculate the product of the current sublist.\n- The variable `current_sublist` is initialized as an empty list and updated with each iteration of the inner loop to store the current sublist.\n- If the current product equals `n`, the current sublist is appended to `sublists` and the inner loop is broken.\n- If the current product exceeds `n`, the inner loop is broken.\n- The function returns `sublists`, which contains the list of sublists that meet the conditions.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730663278, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=417, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=654))
