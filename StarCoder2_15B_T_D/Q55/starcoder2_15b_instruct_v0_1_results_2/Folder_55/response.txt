We can start with a window size of 1 and keep increasing it until we find a sublist whose product equals -6. The sublists can be of any size as long as they are contained in the given list.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -6\n    result = []\n    for window_size in range(1, len(lst) + 1):\n        for i in range(len(lst)):\n            window = lst[i:i + window_size]\n            if len(window) < window_size:\n                window = lst[:window_size - len(window)] + window\n            if len(window) == window_size and prod(window) == n:\n                result.append(window)\n    return result\n\n\ndef prod(lst):\n    result = 1\n    for num in lst:\n        result *= num\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `lists_with_product_equal_n` function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists. It iterates through all possible window sizes from 1 to the length of the given list and for each window size, it slides the window through the list and checks if the product of the numbers in the window equals -6. If it does, the window is added to the `result` list. The `prod` function is a helper function that calculates the product of a list of numbers.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730663058, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=332, prompt_tokens=236, total_tokens=568))
