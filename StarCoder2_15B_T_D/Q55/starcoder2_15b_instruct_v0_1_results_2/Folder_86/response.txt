ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, you can use a brute-force approach to iterate through all possible sublists of the given list. For each sublist, you can calculate its product and compare it to -779. If the product is equal to -779, add the sublist to the result list.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    n = len(lst)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n+1):\n            sublist = lst[i:j]\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            if product == -779:\n                result.append(sublist)\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation iterates through all possible sublists of the given list. For each sublist, it calculates its product and checks if it is equal to -779. If so, the sublist is added to the result list.\n\nTo test this function, you can use the example you provided:\n\n```python\nlst = [3, 9, 5, 1, 2, 7, -1]\nresult = lists_with_product_equal_n(lst)\nassert result == [[3, 9, 5, 1], [9, 5, 1, 2], [5, 1, 2, 7], [1, 2, 7, -1]]\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730663383, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=339, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=577))
