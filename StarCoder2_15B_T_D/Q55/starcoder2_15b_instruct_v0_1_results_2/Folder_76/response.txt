The sliding window starts at the beginning of the list and expands until the product of the integers in the window is equal to 247. If the product is greater than 247, the window shrinks by removing the first element. This process is repeated until the end of the list is reached.\n\nHere's how you can write the function in Python, using a circular list and a sliding window approach:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = 247\n    result = []\n    window = []\n    product = 1\n    start = 0\n\n    for i, num in enumerate(lst + lst):\n        product *= num\n        window.append(num)\n\n        while product > n:\n            product /= window[0]\n            window.pop(0)\n\n        if product == n:\n            result.append(window[:])\n\n        start += 1\n        if start == len(lst):\n            window = []\n            product = 1\n            start = 0\n\n    return result\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730663289, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=239, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=477))
