Create a function called `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes a list of integers as an argument.\n2. Create a variable called `n` and assign it a value of -23.\n3. Create a variable called `result` and assign it an empty list.\n4. Create a nested for loop that iterates over the indices of the list.\n5. Inside the nested loop, create a variable called `product` and assign it a value of 1.\n6. Create a for loop that iterates over the elements of the list starting from the current index.\n7. Inside the loop, multiply the current element to `product`.\n8. If `product` is equal to `n`, append the current sublist to `result`.\n9. Return `result`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = -23\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(i, len(lst)):\n            product *= lst[j]\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(lst[i:j + 1])\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list of integers as an argument. It iterates over the indices of the list and calculates the product of the contiguous integers starting from the current index. If the product equals -23, the current sublist is appended to the `result` list. The function returns `result`, which contains a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -23.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730662890, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=388, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=625))
