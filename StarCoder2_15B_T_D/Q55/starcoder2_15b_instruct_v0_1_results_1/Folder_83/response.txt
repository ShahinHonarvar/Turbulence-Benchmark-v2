ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this challenge, we can use a sliding window approach to find all sublists that have a product equal to -57. The idea is to start with a window of size 1 and keep increasing it until we find a sublist with the desired product. If the product of the current window is equal to -57, we add it to the result list. If the product is greater than -57, we can move the window to the right to reduce the product. Otherwise, we can move the window to the left to increase the product. This process continues until the entire list is traversed.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = len(circular_list)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        window = [circular_list[i]]\n        product = circular_list[i]\n        j = (i + 1) % n\n        while product!= -57 and j!= i:\n            window.append(circular_list[j])\n            product *= circular_list[j]\n            if product > -57:\n                product /= window.pop(0)\n            else:\n                product /= circular_list[j]\n            j = (j + 1) % n\n        if product == -57:\n            result.append(window)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation starts with a window size of 1 and moves the window to the right until the product of the window is equal to -57. If the product is greater than -57, it moves the window to the left to reduce the product. If the product is less than -57, it moves the window to the right to increase the product. This process continues until the entire list is traversed.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730662326, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=389, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=626))
