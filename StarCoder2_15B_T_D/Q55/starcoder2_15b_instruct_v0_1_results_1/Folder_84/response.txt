Understand the problem specification: From the given text specification, we can understand that we need to write a function called `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes a circular list of integers as an argument and returns a list of sublists such that the product of the integers in each sublist is equal to -906.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller steps: We can break down the problem into smaller steps such as iterating over the given list, checking if the product of the current sublist is equal to -906, and appending the sublist to the result if it satisfies the condition.\n3. Generate Python code: We can generate Python code based on the steps we have defined. We can use a for loop to iterate over the given list, a conditional statement to check if the product of the current sublist is equal to -906, and an append operation to add the sublist to the result.\n4. Delimit the Python code using triple backticks: To delimit the Python code, we can use triple backticks (```) before and after the code.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    sublist = []\n    product = 1\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        sublist.append(lst[i])\n        product *= lst[i]\n        if product == -906:\n            result.append(sublist)\n        if product == 0:\n            sublist = []\n            product = 1\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes a list as an argument. It returns a list of sublists such that the product of the integers in each sublist is equal to -906. The function iterates over the given list, appending each element to a sublist. The product of the elements in the sublist is calculated and compared to -906. If the product is equal to -906, the sublist is added to the result. If the product is 0, the sublist is reset. The function returns the list of sublists that satisfy the condition.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730662349, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=504, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=742))
