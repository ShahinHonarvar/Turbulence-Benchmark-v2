The outer loop starts at the beginning of the list and moves forward one element at a time. The inner loop starts at the current index of the outer loop and moves forward, accumulating the product of the integers it encounters. If the product equals -44, we have found a sublist that meets the requirements. We add the sublist to the result list and break out of the inner loop to continue with the next index of the outer loop. If the product becomes greater than -44, we break out of the inner loop to continue with the next index of the outer loop.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730661970, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=252, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=489))
