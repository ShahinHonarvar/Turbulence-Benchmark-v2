ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='The given text specification describes a function called `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists. The function should find all sublists with contiguous integers whose product equals 714, and each sublist can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    n = len(lst)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n+1):\n            sublist = lst[i:j]\n            if len(sublist) <= n and len(sublist) > 0 and product(sublist) == 714:\n                result.append(sublist)\n\n    return result\n\ndef product(lst):\n    p = 1\n    for x in lst:\n        p *= x\n    return p\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730661822, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=265, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=503))
