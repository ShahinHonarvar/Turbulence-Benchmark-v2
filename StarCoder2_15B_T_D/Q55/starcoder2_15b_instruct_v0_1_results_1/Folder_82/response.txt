We can iterate through the given list and expand the window size, calculating the product of the integers in the window. If the product equals 8, we add the sublist to the result list. We can also use a dictionary to store the sublists and their products to avoid duplicates.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `lists_with_product_equal_n`:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst, n):\n    result = []\n    sublist_products = {}\n    window_size = 1\n    while window_size <= len(lst):\n        for i in range(len(lst)):\n            window_product = 1\n            for j in range(i, i + window_size):\n                window_product *= lst[j % len(lst)]\n            if window_product == n and (i, window_size) not in sublist_products:\n                result.append(lst[i:i + window_size])\n                sublist_products[(i, window_size)] = window_product\n        window_size += 1\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list of integers `lst` and an integer `n` as arguments. It returns a list of sublists such that their product equals `n`. The function uses a sliding window approach to iterate through the list, expanding the window size from 1 to the size of the list. For each window size, it iterates through the list and calculates the product of the integers in the window. If the product equals `n`, it adds the sublist to the result list. It uses a dictionary `sublist_products` to store the sublists and their products to avoid duplicates.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730662308, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=391, prompt_tokens=236, total_tokens=627))
