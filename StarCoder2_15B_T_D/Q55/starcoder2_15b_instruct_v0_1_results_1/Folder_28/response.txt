ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to traverse the circular list. We will keep track of the product of the integers in the current window and the number of elements in the window. If the product of the current window is 85, we will add the window to the result list. If the product is greater than 85, we will shrink the window by removing the first element until the product is less than or equal to 85. We will continue this process until we reach the end of the list.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem according to the given specification:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    n = len(nums)\n    result = []\n    product = 1\n    left, right = 0, 0\n    while right < n:\n        product *= nums[right]\n        while product > 85:\n            product /= nums[left]\n            left += 1\n        if product == 85:\n            result.append(nums[left:right + 1])\n        right += 1\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730661756, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=255, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=492))
