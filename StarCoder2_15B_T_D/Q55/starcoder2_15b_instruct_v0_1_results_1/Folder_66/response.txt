For each sublist, it calculates its product using another nested for loop. If the product equals 78, the sublist is added to the list of sublists.\n\nThe modulo operator is used to handle the circular nature of the list by ensuring that the indices of the elements being multiplied are within the bounds of the list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730662165, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=278, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=515))
