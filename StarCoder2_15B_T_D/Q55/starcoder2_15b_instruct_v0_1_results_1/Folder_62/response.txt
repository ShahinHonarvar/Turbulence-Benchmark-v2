ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use a simple brute-force approach. We can iterate over the given list, and for each index, we can try to find a sublist that starts at that index and has a product of 100. We can do this by iterating over the sublists of all possible lengths starting at that index, and checking if their product is equal to 100. If we find a sublist with a product of 100, we can add it to the result list.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(1, len(lst) + 1):\n            sublist = lst[i:i+j]\n            if len(sublist) > len(lst):\n                sublist = sublist[:len(lst)]\n            if len(sublist) == 0:\n                continue\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            if product == 100:\n                result.append(sublist)\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the indices of the given list, and for each index, it iterates over all possible lengths of sublists starting at that index. It then checks if the product of the sublist is equal to 100. If so, it adds the sublist to the result list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730662117, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=321, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=559))
