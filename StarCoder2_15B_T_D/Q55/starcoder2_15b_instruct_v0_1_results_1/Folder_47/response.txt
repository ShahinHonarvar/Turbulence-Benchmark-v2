ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To solve this problem, we can use a nested loop approach to iterate over the given list and find all sublists that have a product equal to -94. The first loop will iterate over the indices of the list, while the second loop will iterate over the length of the sublist starting from the current index. For each sublist length, we will calculate the product of the contiguous integers and compare it to -94. If it matches, we will append the sublist to the result list. We will also check for duplicates by converting each sublist to a tuple and adding it to a set. Finally, we will return the list of sublists represented by the tuples in the result set.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function 'lists_with_product_equal_n' in Python:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = set()\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(1, len(lst) + 1):\n            sublist = lst[i:i+j]\n            if len(sublist) > 0 and len(sublist) <= len(lst) and 1 == abs(94 // reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, sublist)):\n                result.add(tuple(sublist))\n    return [list(x) for x in result]\n```\n\nThe 'lists_with_product_equal_n' function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -94. The function uses a nested loop approach to iterate over the list and calculate the product of each sublist. If the product matches -94, the sublist is added to the result set. The result set is converted to a list of lists before returning it.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730661926, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=398, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=635))
