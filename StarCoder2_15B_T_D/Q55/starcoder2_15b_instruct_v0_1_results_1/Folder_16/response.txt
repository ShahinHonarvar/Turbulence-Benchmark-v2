It returns a list of sublists where each sublist contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -837. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter. This means that sublists with the same elements but in a different order will be considered the same.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` in Python:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = -837\n    sublists = []\n    for i in range(len(circular_list)):\n        sublist = [circular_list[i]]\n        product = circular_list[i]\n        j = (i + 1) % len(circular_list)\n        while product!= n and j!= i:\n            sublist.append(circular_list[j])\n            product *= circular_list[j]\n            j = (j + 1) % len(circular_list)\n        if product == n:\n            sublists.append(sublist)\n    return sublists\n```\n\nThe function `lists_with_product_equal_n` iterates over the elements of the circular list. For each element, it creates a sublist containing just that element. It then multiplies the element with the next element in the circular list, adding the next element to the sublist. This process continues until the product of the elements in the sublist equals `-837` or we have reached the end of the circular list. If the product equals `-837`, the sublist is added to the list of sublists.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730661634, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=371, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=609))
