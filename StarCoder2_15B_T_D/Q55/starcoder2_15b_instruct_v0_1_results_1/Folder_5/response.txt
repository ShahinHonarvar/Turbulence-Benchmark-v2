The sliding window will move forward one index at a time, and the product of the integers within the window will be calculated. If the product equals -33, the current window will be added to the result list. If the product is greater than -33, the window will be shifted to the right until the product becomes -33 or less. If the product is less than -33, the window will be shifted to the left until the product becomes -33 or greater. This process will continue until the end of the list is reached.\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    result = []\n    window_size = 1\n    product = 1\n    left = 0\n    right = 0\n    while right < len(nums):\n        product *= nums[right]\n        while product > -33:\n            if product == -33:\n                result.append(nums[left:right + 1])\n            product /= nums[left]\n            left += 1\n        right += 1\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730661520, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=240, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=477))
