If no such sublist exists, an empty list is returned. If there are duplicates, they are all included in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730661547, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=200, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=438))
