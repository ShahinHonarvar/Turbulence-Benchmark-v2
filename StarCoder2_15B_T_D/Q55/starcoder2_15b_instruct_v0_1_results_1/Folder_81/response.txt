If the product equals -8, the sublist is added to the list of sublists. If the product becomes greater than -8, the current sublist is no longer a valid solution and the loop is broken. This approach ensures that all sublists with the required product are found, even if there are duplicates.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730662290, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=221, prompt_tokens=236, total_tokens=457))
