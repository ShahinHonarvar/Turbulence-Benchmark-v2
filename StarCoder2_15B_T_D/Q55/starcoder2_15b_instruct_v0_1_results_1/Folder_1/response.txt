The circular list allows us to consider the head and tail as adjacent elements, which simplifies the implementation. We can use a variable `prod` to track the product of the elements in the current window. If the product is -51, we add the current window to the result list. We then slide the window forward one element at a time, updating the product accordingly. If the product becomes 1, we reset the window to start from the next element. This process continues until we reach the end of the list, and we return the list of sublists that have a product of -51.\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    result = []\n    n = len(circular_list)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prod = 1\n        j = i\n        while prod!= -51:\n            prod *= circular_list[j]\n            if prod == -51:\n                result.append(circular_list[i:j + 1])\n            j = (j + 1) % n\n            if prod == 1:\n                break\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730661490, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=253, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=490))
