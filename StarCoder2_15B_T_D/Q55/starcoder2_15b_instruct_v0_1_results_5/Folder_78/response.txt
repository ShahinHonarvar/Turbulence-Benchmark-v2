Identify the function name and its arguments: The function name is `lists_with_product_equal_n` and it takes a single argument, `lst`, which is a circular list of integers.\n2. Understand the task: The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 74. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list.\n3. Translate the task into Python code: You can use a nested for loop to iterate over all possible sublists of the given list, and check if their product equals 74. If so, add the sublist to the result list.\n4. Remove any comments or unnecessary code: The Python code should not contain any comments, so you can remove any comments or unnecessary code from the code snippet.\n5. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks, so you can surround the code with triple backticks to delimit it.\n\nHere's an example of how you can create Python code according to the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    n = len(lst)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            sublist = lst[i:j]\n            if len(sublist) <= n and product(sublist) == 74:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n\ndef product(lst):\n    p = 1\n    for x in lst:\n        p *= x\n    return p\n```\n\nIn this example, we define two functions: `lists_with_product_equal_n` and `product`. The `lists_with_product_equal_n` function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 74. The `product` function is a helper function that calculates the product of a list of integers.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730666364, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=481, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=718))
