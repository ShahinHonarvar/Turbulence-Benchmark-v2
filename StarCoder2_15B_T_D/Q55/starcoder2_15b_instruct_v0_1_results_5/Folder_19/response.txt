Create a function called `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes a list of integers as an argument.\n2. Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the sublists.\n3. Loop through the given list of integers.\n4. For each index, use a nested loop to find all sublists that start at that index and have a product of -54.\n5. Add each sublist that meets the criteria to the `result` list.\n6. Return the `result` list.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums):\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums) + i):\n            sublist = nums[i:j]\n            if len(sublist) > len(nums):\n                break\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            if product == -54:\n                result.append(sublist)\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function loops through the given list of integers and finds all sublists that start at each index and have a product of -54. It checks for sublists that are larger than the given list and breaks the nested loop to avoid unnecessary iterations. The function returns a list of sublists that meet the criteria.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665727, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=347, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=584))
