Within the nested loop, we can calculate the product of the integers in the current window, and if the product equals -82, we can add the window to the result list.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function using the sliding window approach:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    n = len(lst)\n    for window_size in range(1, n + 1):\n        for start_index in range(n):\n            window_product = 1\n            for i in range(start_index, start_index + window_size):\n                window_product *= lst[i % n]\n            if window_product == -82:\n                result.append(lst[start_index:start_index + window_size])\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `lists_with_product_equal_n` function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -82. The function iterates through all possible window sizes from 1 to the length of the list, and for each window size, it iterates through all possible starting indices. For each window, it calculates the product of the integers in the window and checks if it equals -82. If it does, it adds the window to the result list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665822, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=351, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=588))
