The function iterates through the list starting from the first element and maintains a current sublist and its product. At each iteration, the current element is added to the current sublist and its product is updated. If the current product is equal to -91, the current sublist is appended to the result list. The index is then incremented and the process continues until all elements in the list have been visited.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730666523, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=316, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=553))
