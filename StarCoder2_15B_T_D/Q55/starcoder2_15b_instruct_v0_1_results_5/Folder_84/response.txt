If not, we continue to the next index. If the product is equal to -906, we add the sublist to the result list and continue to the next index.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(circular_list)):\n        sublist = [circular_list[i]]\n        product = circular_list[i]\n        j = (i + 1) % len(circular_list)\n        while product!= -906 and j!= i:\n            sublist.append(circular_list[j])\n            product *= circular_list[j]\n            j = (j + 1) % len(circular_list)\n        if product == -906:\n            result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `circular_list` is the given circular list of integers.\n- `result` is the list of sublists that will be returned.\n- `i` is the index of the current integer being considered.\n- `sublist` is the current sublist being formed.\n- `product` is the product of the integers in the current sublist.\n- `j` is the index of the next integer to be considered.\n- The `while` loop continues to add integers to the sublist while the product is not equal to -906 and we haven't reached the end of the list.\n- If the product is equal to -906, we add the sublist to the result list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730666426, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=396, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=634))
