Create a function called `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes an argument, a circular list of integers.\n2. In the function, iterate through the given list of integers and create sublists containing contiguous integers.\n3. For each sublist, calculate its product and compare it with -32.\n4. If the product is equal to -32, append the sublist to the result list.\n5. Return the result list.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(circular_list)):\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i + len(circular_list)):\n            sublist.append(circular_list[j % len(circular_list)])\n            if len(sublist) > len(circular_list):\n                break\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            if product == -32:\n                result.append(sublist)\n    return result\n```\n\nIn the provided implementation, the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list of integers as an argument. It iterates through the list and creates sublists containing contiguous integers. For each sublist, it calculates its product and compares it with -32. If the product is equal to -32, the sublist is appended to the result list. The function returns the result list containing all the sublists whose product is equal to -32.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665799, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=360, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=597))
