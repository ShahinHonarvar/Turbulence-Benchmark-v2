You also need to know how to find contiguous sublists that have a product equal to a given number.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list, n):\n    sublists = []\n    for i in range(len(circular_list)):\n        product = 1\n        sublist = []\n        for j in range(i, i + len(circular_list)):\n            index = j % len(circular_list)\n            product *= circular_list[index]\n            sublist.append(circular_list[index])\n            if product == n:\n                sublists.append(sublist)\n                break\n            elif product > n:\n                break\n    return sublists\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we iterate through the circular list using two for loops. The outer loop iterates through the indices of the circular list, and the inner loop iterates through the integers of the circular list starting from the current index. We keep track of the product of the integers as we iterate through the circular list. If the product equals `n`, we add the sublist to the `sublists` list. If the product exceeds `n`, we break out of the inner loop and continue with the next index in the outer loop.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665903, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=295, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=532))
