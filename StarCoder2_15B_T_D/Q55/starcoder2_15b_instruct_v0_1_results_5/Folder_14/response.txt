ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to iterate through the given circular list and find all contiguous sublists that have a product equal to -72. We can track the product of the current sublist and update it as we move the window forward. If the product equals -72, we add the sublist to the result.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    result = []\n    n = -72\n    product = 1\n    start = 0\n    for i, num in enumerate(lst):\n        product *= num\n        while product > n:\n            product //= lst[start]\n            start += 1\n        if product == n:\n            result.append(lst[start:i + 1])\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a sliding window approach to find all sublists that have a product equal to -72. The `product` variable tracks the product of the current sublist, and it is updated as we move the window forward. If the product equals -72, we add the sublist to the result.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665678, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=249, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=486))
