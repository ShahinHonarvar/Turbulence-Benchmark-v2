For each sublist, we can calculate its product and check if it equals 37. If so, we add the sublist to the result list.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(nums: List[int], n: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n    """\n    Returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the\n    given list such that their product equals `n`. Each sublist in the returned list can\n    be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list.\n    If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are\n    duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The\n    order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n    """\n    result = []\n\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i, i + len(nums)):\n            sublist = nums[i:j]\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            if product == n:\n                result.append(sublist)\n\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730666064, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=290, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=527))
