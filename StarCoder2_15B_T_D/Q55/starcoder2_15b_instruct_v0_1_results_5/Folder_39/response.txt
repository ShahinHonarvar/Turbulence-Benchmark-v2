The idea is to use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the start and end of the current window. The window size can vary from 1 to the size of the given list. At each step, you can multiply the integers in the current window and compare the product with -46. If it matches, you can add the current window to the result list. Then, you can shift the window by one position to the right and repeat the process until the end of the list is reached.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    n = len(lst)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            window = lst[i:j]\n            product = 1\n            for x in window:\n                product *= x\n            if product == -46:\n                result.append(window)\n    return result\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665931, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=237, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=474))
