ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we first need to understand the text specification. From the given text specification, we can see that we need to write a function called `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes a circular list of integers as an argument. The function should return a list of sublists, each of which contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 76. Each sublist can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `lists_with_product_equal_n`:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list, n):\n    sublists = []\n\n    for i in range(len(circular_list)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(circular_list) + 1):\n            sublist = circular_list[i:j]\n            if len(sublist) <= len(circular_list) and prod(sublist) == n:\n                sublists.append(sublist)\n\n    return sublists\n\ndef prod(iterable):\n    return 1 if not iterable else iterable[0] * prod(iterable[1:])\n```\n\nThe function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes two arguments: a circular list of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, each of which contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals `n`.\n\nThe function `prod` is a helper function that calculates the product of all elements in an iterable. It is used to check if the product of the elements in a sublist equals `n`.\n\nThe function `lists_with_product_equal_n` uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible sublists of the given circular list. For each sublist, it checks if its length is smaller than or equal to the size of the circular list and if the product of its elements equals `n`. If both conditions are satisfied, the sublist is added to the `sublists` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `sublists` list, which contains all the sublists that satisfy the given conditions.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730665877, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=516, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=753))
