In this case, the function should take a circular list of integers as input and return a list of sublists such that their product is equal to -779. The sublists can be of any size, as long as they are smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    sublists = []\n    n = len(lst)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n+i):\n            sublist = lst[i:j]\n            product = 1\n            for num in sublist:\n                product *= num\n            if product == -779:\n                sublists.append(sublist)\n\n    return sublists\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we iterate over all sublists of the given list using two nested loops. For each sublist, we calculate its product and check if it equals -779. If it does, we add it to the list of sublists. Finally, we return the list of sublists.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730666447, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=302, prompt_tokens=238, total_tokens=540))
