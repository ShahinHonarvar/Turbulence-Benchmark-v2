We can use a sliding window approach to find sublists in the given list that have a product equal to 33.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst, n):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        window = [lst[i]]\n        product = lst[i]\n        j = (i + 1) % len(lst)\n        while product < n and j!= i:\n            window.append(lst[j])\n            product *= lst[j]\n            j = (j + 1) % len(lst)\n        if product == n:\n            result.append(window)\n    return result\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `lists_with_product_equal_n(lst, n)` is the function that takes a circular list `lst` and an integer `n` as arguments.\n- `result` is a list that will store the sublists that have a product equal to `n`.\n- The `for` loop iterates over the indices of the list `lst`.\n- `window` is a list that stores the current sublist being considered.\n- `product` is an integer that stores the product of the elements in the current sublist.\n- The `while` loop slides the window over the list `lst`, adding elements to the sublist and updating the product until the product becomes equal to `n` or exceeds `n`.\n- If the product equals `n`, the current sublist is added to the `result` list.\n- Finally, the function returns the `result` list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730666259, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=386, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=623))
