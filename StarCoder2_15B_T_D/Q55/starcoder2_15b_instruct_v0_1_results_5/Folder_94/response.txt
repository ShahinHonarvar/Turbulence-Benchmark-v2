Understand the problem: The problem statement describes a function called `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes a circular list of integers as an argument. The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -30.\n2. Create a function: Create a function called `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes a list as an argument.\n3. Initialize an empty list to store the sublists: Initialize an empty list called `sublists` to store the sublists that meet the requirement.\n4. Iterate over the given list: Use a for loop to iterate over the given list.\n5. Calculate the product of the integers in the sublist: Use a nested for loop to calculate the product of the integers in the sublist.\n6. Check if the product is equal to -30: Use an if statement to check if the product is equal to -30.\n7. Append the sublist to the `sublists` list: If the product is equal to -30, append the sublist to the `sublists` list.\n8. Return the `sublists` list: Return the `sublists` list at the end of the function.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):\n    sublists = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(i, len(lst)):\n            product = 1\n            for k in range(i, j + 1):\n                product *= lst[k % len(lst)]\n            if product == -30:\n                sublists.append(lst[i:j + 1])\n    return sublists\n```\n\nThis function iterates over all sublists in the given list and calculates their product. If the product is equal to -30, the sublist is added to the `sublists` list. The function returns the `sublists` list at the end.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730666544, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=458, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=695))
