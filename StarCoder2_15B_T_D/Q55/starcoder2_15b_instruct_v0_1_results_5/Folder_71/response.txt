We can start with the first element of the list and keep moving the window forward one element at a time. We can keep track of the product of the elements in the current window and the size of the window. If the product equals 47, we can add the current window to the result list. If the product is greater than 47, we can shrink the window by removing the first element until the product is less than or equal to 47. We can repeat this process until we reach the end of the list.\n\nHere's an implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    n = len(circular_list)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        window = []\n        product = 1\n        size = 0\n        for j in range(i, i + n):\n            window.append(circular_list[j % n])\n            product *= circular_list[j % n]\n            size += 1\n            if product == 47:\n                result.append(window[:])\n            elif product > 47:\n                while product > 47:\n                    product /= window[0]\n                    window.pop(0)\n                    size -= 1\n                if product == 47:\n                    result.append(window[:])\n    return result\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730666295, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=315, prompt_tokens=237, total_tokens=552))
