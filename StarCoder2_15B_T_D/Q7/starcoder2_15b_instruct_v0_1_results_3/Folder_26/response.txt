We can also use Python's built-in functions, such as `slice()`, to extract the desired range of integers from the list.\n\nHere's an example of how we can create Python code that meets the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(ints):\n    return list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, ints[62:100]))\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function called `all_even_ints_inclusive()` that takes a list of integers as an argument. We then use the `filter()` function to filter out the even integers from the list, and the `lambda` function to check if each integer is even. We also use the `slice()` function to extract the desired range of integers from the list. Finally, we return the filtered list of even integers as the result of the function.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730479101, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=232, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=380))
