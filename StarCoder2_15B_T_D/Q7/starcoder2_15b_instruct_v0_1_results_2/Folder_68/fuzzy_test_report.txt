Out of 3 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 2 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-377, -477, -363, 189, 332, -204, 81, -35, -226, -116]


The correct answer was:

[332, -204, -226]

But the LLM code returned:
[332, -204, -226, -116]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

[-217, 312, 12, 448, -26, 283, -88, -105, -266, 91]

======================================================================================================================================================

(3) Test input:

[-28, 417, -121, -309, 464, 449, 370, -358, 227, -421]
