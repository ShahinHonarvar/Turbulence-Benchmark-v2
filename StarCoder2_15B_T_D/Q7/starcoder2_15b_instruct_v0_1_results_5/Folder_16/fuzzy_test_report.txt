Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[241, -31, 130, -217, 454, 357, 401, 121, 53, -440, -112, 312, 91, -88, -240, -209, 448, 12, -535, 531, 5, 202, -266, -275, 341, 335, -73, 513, -26, 442, -26, 281, -105, 252, 450, 438, -264, 283]


The correct answer was:

[252, 450, 438, -264]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
