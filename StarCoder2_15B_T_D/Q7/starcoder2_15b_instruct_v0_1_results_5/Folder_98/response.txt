Understand the specification: Read the text specification carefully and understand what the function should do.\n2. Break down the problem: Break down the problem into smaller parts, such as understanding the input and output of the function.\n3. Code the solution: Write the Python code to solve the problem according to the specification.\n4. Test the code: Test the code to ensure it meets the specification.\n\nHere's an example of how you can create Python code based on the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(ints):\n    even_ints = []\n    for i in range(len(ints)):\n        if i >= 0 and i <= 6:\n            if ints[i] % 2 == 0:\n                even_ints.append(ints[i])\n    return even_ints\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730480789, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=198, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=344))
