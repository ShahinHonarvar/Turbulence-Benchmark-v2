Extract the text specification: Extract the text specification by removing the surrounding angle brackets.\n2. Generate Python code: Generate Python code based on the text specification. In this case, you are asked to create a function called `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 62 to index 63, both inclusive.\n3. Format the code: Format the code to follow Python coding conventions and best practices.\n4. Delimit the code: Delimit the code using triple backticks to indicate the start and end of the code block.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [x for x in lst[62:64] if x % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all even integers from index 62 to index 63, both inclusive. The list comprehension iterates over the specified range in the input list and filters out the even integers.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730477940, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=262, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=410))
