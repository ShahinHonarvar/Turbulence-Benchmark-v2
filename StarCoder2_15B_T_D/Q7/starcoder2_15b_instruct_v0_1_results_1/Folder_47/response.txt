Identify the function name: The function name is 'all_even_ints_inclusive'.\n2. Define the function signature: The function takes one argument, a list of integers.\n3. Extract the requirement: The function should return the list of all even integers from index 37 to index 76, both inclusive.\n4. Write the code: Use a list comprehension to filter the even integers from the given list, and slice the resulting list to extract the required range.\n5. Test the code: Write tests to ensure the function works as expected.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0][37:77]\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called 'all_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers.
