The function first iterates through all numbers from 2 to the 993rd element of the tuple and checks if each number is a left-truncatable prime by dividing it by 10 repeatedly until it is a single-digit number. If it remains a prime number during this process, it is added to the list of left-truncatable primes. The function then checks if each number is a right-truncatable prime by taking the modulo of the number by 10^(n-1), where n is the number of digits in the number, repeatedly until it is a single-digit number. If it remains a prime number during this process, it is added to the list of right-truncatable primes. The function then finds the intersection of the left-truncatable primes and the right-truncatable primes to obtain a list of all left-and-right-truncatable primes. The list of left-and-right-truncatable primes is then sorted in ascending order and returned.\n\nThe `is_prime` function is a helper function that takes a number as input and returns True if the number is a prime number and False otherwise. The function iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number and checks if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, the number is a prime number.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730690447, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=810, prompt_tokens=235, total_tokens=1045))
