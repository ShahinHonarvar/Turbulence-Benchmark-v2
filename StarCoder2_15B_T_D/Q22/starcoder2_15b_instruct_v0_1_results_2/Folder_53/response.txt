ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To write the Python code, follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the text specification: The specification states that we need to write a function called `find_sum_of_multiples` that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 60 positive multiples of the given integer.\n2. Break down the function into smaller steps: The function `find_sum_of_multiples` will need to generate a list of the first 60 positive multiples of the given integer, then sum them up.\n3. Define the function: The function can be defined with a single parameter, `n`, to represent the given integer.\n4. Generate the list of multiples: This can be done using a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a list by looping over a range of numbers and appending them to the list if they are multiples of `n`.\n5. Sum the multiples: Once the list of multiples is generated, the sum can be calculated using the built-in `sum` function.\n6. Return the result: The result of the summation should be returned from the function.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `find_sum_of_multiples` according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    multiples = [i for i in range(1, 61) if n * i > 0]\n    return sum(multiples)\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730522398, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=325, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=452))
