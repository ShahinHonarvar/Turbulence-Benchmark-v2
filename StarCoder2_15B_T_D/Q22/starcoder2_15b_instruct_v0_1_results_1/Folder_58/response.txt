Extract the information from the text specification: In this case, the function name is \'find_sum_of_multiples\' and the argument is a positive integer.\n2. Write the code: The code should be written in such a way that it does not contain any comments or triple backticks.\n3. Delimit the code: The code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere is an example of how you can create Python code based on the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    """\n    This function takes a positive integer as input and returns the sum of the first 223 positive multiples of the given integer.\n    """\n    multiples = []\n    for i in range(1, 224):\n        multiples.append(n * i)\n\n    return sum(multiples)\n```\n\nThis code extracts the information from the text specification and writes the code in such a way that it does not contain any comments or triple backticks.
