Extract the function name and arguments from the text specification. In this case, the function name is `find_sum_of_multiples` and the argument is `a positive integer`.\n2. Decide on the return type of the function. In this case, it is specified that the function should return the sum of the first 6 positive multiples of the given integer, which is an integer.\n3. Write the function definition in Python, including the function name, arguments, and return type.\n4. Implement the function logic in Python, which involves calculating the first 6 positive multiples of the given integer and returning their sum.\n5. Generate the Python code as a string by combining the function definition and logic using triple backticks.\n6. Remove any comments from the Python code.\n7. Delimit the Python code using triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    multiples = [i * n for i in range(1, 7)]\n    return sum(multiples)\n```\n\nThis function takes a positive integer as an argument and returns the sum of the first 6 positive multiples of the given integer. The function definition is written in Python, including the function name, arguments, and return type. The function logic is implemented by calculating the first 6 positive multiples of the given integer using list comprehension and returning their sum using the sum() function. The Python code is generated by combining the function definition and logic using triple backticks and is delimited by triple backticks.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730522048, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=365, prompt_tokens=126, total_tokens=491))
