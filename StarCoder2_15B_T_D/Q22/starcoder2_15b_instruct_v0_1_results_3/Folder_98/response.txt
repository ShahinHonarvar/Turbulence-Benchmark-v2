ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='The given instruction is to write a function called `find_sum_of_multiples` that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 10 positive multiples of the given integer. To achieve this, we can use a for loop to iterate over the first 10 positive multiples of the given integer and sum them up.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    sum_of_multiples = 0\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        sum_of_multiples += n * i\n    return sum_of_multiples\n```\n\nThis function takes in a positive integer `n` as an argument and returns the sum of the first 10 positive multiples of `n`. The `for` loop iterates over the range from 1 to 10 and multiplies each value with `n` to get the first 10 positive multiples of `n`. The sum of these multiples is accumulated in the `sum_of_multiples` variable, which is then returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730523243, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=246, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=373))
