It does this by iterating from 1 to 15 and adding each multiple of `num` to the variable `sum_of_multiples`, which is initialized to 0. At the end of the function, the value of `sum_of_multiples` is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730523680, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=326, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=453))
