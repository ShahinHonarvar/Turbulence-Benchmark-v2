ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code according to the given text specification, the following steps need to be followed:\n\n1. Understand the specification: The given text specification states that we need to create a function called `find_sum_of_multiples` that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 24 positive multiples of the given integer.\n\n2. Extract key information: From the specification, we can extract the following key information:\n   - Function name: `find_sum_of_multiples`\n   - Number of arguments: 1\n   - Argument name: `n`\n   - Data type of argument: positive integer\n   - Return value: sum of the first 24 positive multiples of `n`\n\n3. Create Python code: Using the key information extracted from the specification, we can create the following Python code:\n\n   ```python\n   def find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n       multiples = [i * n for i in range(1, 25)]\n       return sum(multiples)\n   ```\n\n   This code defines a function called `find_sum_of_multiples` that takes a positive integer `n` as an argument. It then creates a list of the first 24 positive multiples of `n` using list comprehension. Finally, it returns the sum of the multiples using the `sum` function.\n\n4. Remove comments: Since the specification states that the Python code should not contain any comments, we can remove any unnecessary comments from the code.\n\n5. Delimit code with triple backticks: The triple backticks are used to delimit the code block in Markdown, which is a formatting syntax used in GitHub and other places.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    multiples = [i * n for i in range(1, 25)]\n    return sum(multiples)\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730524024, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=423, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=550))
