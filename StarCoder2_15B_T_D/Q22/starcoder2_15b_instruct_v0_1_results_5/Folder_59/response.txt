Determine the multiples: To find the multiples of a given integer, we can use a loop to iterate over the range from 1 to 21 and multiply the integer with each number in the range.\n2. Sum the multiples: To sum the multiples, we can use the built-in `sum` function, which takes an iterable as input and returns the sum of its elements.\n3. Create the function: We can create a function called `find_sum_of_multiples` that takes one argument, `num`, which is a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 21 positive multiples of `num`.\n4. Test the function: To verify that the function works as intended, you can write some test cases to check the sum of multiples for different inputs.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(num):\n    multiples = [num * i for i in range(1, 22)]\n    return sum(multiples)\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to generate the first 21 multiples of the given number `num`, and then uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the multiples.\n\nTo test this function, you can write some test cases to check the sum of multiples for different inputs:\n\n```python\nassert find_sum_of_multiples(3) == 630\nassert find_sum_of_multiples(5) == 2750\nassert find_sum_of_multiples(7) == 4620\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730524166, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=409, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=536))
