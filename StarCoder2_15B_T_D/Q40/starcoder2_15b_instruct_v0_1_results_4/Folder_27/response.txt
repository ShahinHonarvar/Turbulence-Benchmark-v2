Extract the text specification: The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets. You can use a regular expression to extract the text specification from the instruction.\n2. Generate Python code: You can use a code generator to generate Python code based on the extracted text specification. In this case, you can use a Python function called `return_n_smallest_chars` that takes a string of distinct characters as an argument and returns a list of the 82 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values.\n3. Sort the list: The list should be sorted in ascending order. You can use the `sorted` function to sort the list.\n4. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. You can use a f-string to include the Python code within the triple backticks.\n\nHere is how you can generate Python code based on the text specification:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef generate_python_code(instruction):\n    text_specification = re.search(r"<(.*?)>", instruction).group(1)\n    python_code = f"""```python\ndef return_n_smallest_chars(s):\n    return sorted(s)[:82]\n```"""\n\n    return python_code\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730577616, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=290, prompt_tokens=144, total_tokens=434))
