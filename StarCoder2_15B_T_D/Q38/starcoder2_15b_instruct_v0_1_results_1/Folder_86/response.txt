We also assume that the set contains at least 380 elements. If the set contains fewer than 380 elements, we return 0 to indicate that there are no subsets of size 380. Otherwise, we return the number of elements in the set, which is the same as the number of subsets of size 380.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730570995, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=197, prompt_tokens=126, total_tokens=323))
