It does this by finding the number of elements in the set and subtracting 53 from it.\n\nNow, let's break down the code:\n\n```python\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(elements):\n    return len(elements) - 53\n```\n\nThis function takes a set of elements as an argument and returns the number of subsets of size 53 from that set.
