For example, the subset {1, 2} is contained within the set {1, 2, 3}. To count the number of subsets of a given set, we can use the power set approach.\n\nThe power set of a set is the set of all possible subsets of that set, including the empty set and the set itself. For example, the power set of the set {1, 2, 3} is {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.\n\nTo count the number of subsets of a given set, we can use the power set approach.
