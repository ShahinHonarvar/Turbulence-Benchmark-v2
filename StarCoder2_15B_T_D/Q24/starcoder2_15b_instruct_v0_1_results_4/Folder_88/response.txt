We can then iterate through all the positive divisors of `n` and check if they are between 6 and 7, and add them up to get the sum.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 6 <= i <= 7:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730530579, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=176, prompt_tokens=156, total_tokens=332))
