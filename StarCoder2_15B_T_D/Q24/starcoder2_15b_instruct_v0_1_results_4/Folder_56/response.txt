Within the function, you can calculate the divisors of the given integer using a list comprehension. Next, you can filter the divisors to include only those that are between 6 and 9, both inclusive. Finally, you can return the sum of the filtered divisors.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    return sum(d for d in range(1, n+1) if n % d == 0 and 6 <= d <= 9)\n```\n\nThe `range(1, n+1)` function generates a list of all positive integers up to the given number `n`. The `sum` function calculates the sum of the elements in the list. The `for` loop iterates over the range and calculates the divisors of `n` using the modulo operator `%`. The `if` statement filters the divisors to include only those that are between 6 and 9.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730530349, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=241, prompt_tokens=156, total_tokens=397))
