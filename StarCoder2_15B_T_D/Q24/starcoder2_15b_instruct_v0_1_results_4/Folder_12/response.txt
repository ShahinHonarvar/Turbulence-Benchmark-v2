ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the instruction, we can write a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument. The function should return the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 13 and 62, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(num):\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, num + 1):\n        if num % i == 0 and 13 <= i <= 62:\n            sum_of_divisors += i\n    return sum_of_divisors\n```\n\nThe function `sum_of_divisors_in_range` takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 13 and 62, both inclusive. It iterates through all the divisors of the given integer and checks if they are in the specified range. If a divisor is in the range, it is added to the `sum_of_divisors`. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730530036, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=292, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=450))
