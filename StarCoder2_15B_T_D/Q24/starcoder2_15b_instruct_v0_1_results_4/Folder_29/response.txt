The function should be named `sum_of_divisors_in_range` and take a positive integer as its argument.\n\nHere's the Python code that achieves this:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    return sum(d for d in range(1, n + 1) if n % d == 0 and 43 <= d <= 77)\n```\n\nThe function uses a generator expression to generate all divisors of `n` between 43 and 77, and then uses the `sum` function to calculate their sum. The `range(1, n + 1)` generates all positive integers from 1 to `n`, and the `if` clause filters out those that are divisors of `n` and within the specified range.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730530136, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=229, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=387))
