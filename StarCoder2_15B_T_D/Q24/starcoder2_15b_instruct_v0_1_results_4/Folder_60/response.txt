In this case, the text specification says that we need to write a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 41 and 55, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere's how we can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(num):\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, num + 1):\n        if num % i == 0 and 41 <= i <= 55:\n            sum_of_divisors += i\n    return sum_of_divisors\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730530383, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=203, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=361))
