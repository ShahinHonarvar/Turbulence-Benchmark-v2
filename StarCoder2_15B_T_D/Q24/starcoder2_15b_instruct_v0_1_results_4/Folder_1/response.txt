If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to write Python code that does not contain any comments and is delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 10 <= i <= 55:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```\n\nThe code consists of a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument. It then calculates the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 10 and 55, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730529949, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=265, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=423))
