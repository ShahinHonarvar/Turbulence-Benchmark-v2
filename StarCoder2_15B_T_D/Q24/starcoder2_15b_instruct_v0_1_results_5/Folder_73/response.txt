The function's purpose is to return the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 46 and 89, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `sum_of_divisors_in_range` in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 46 <= i <= 89:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```\n\nThis function iterates over all the positive integers from 1 to the given integer `n` and checks if they are divisors of `n`. If they are divisors and are between 46 and 89, both inclusive, they are added to the `sum`. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730531210, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=257, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=415))
