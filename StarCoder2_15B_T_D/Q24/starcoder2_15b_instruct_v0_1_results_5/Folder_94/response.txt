ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem using Python, we need to understand the requirements and constraints of the function. The function should take a positive integer as its argument, and return the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 35 and 37, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 35 <= i <= 37:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we iterate through all the divisors of the given integer n using a for loop. We check if the current divisor i divides n evenly and is between 35 and 37, both inclusive. If it is, we add it to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730531343, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=224, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=382))
