Here's the code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 32 <= i <= 90:\n            sum_of_divisors += i\n    return sum_of_divisors\n```\n\nThe function `sum_of_divisors_in_range` takes a positive integer `n` as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 32 and 90, both inclusive.\n\nThe function iterates through all positive integers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop. For each integer `i`, the function checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` and if it is also between 32 and 90, both inclusive. If both conditions are met, the divisor `i` is added to the `sum_of_divisors`.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730531198, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=291, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=449))
