Determine the divisors of the given integer.\n2. Filter out the divisors that are between 4 and 7, both inclusive.\n3. Sum up the remaining divisors.\n\nHere is how you could implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(number):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(1, number + 1) if number % i == 0]\n    filtered_divisors = [divisor for divisor in divisors if 4 <= divisor <= 7]\n    sum_of_filtered_divisors = sum(filtered_divisors)\n\n    return sum_of_filtered_divisors\n```\n\nThe function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of divisors of the given number. It then filters out the divisors that are between 4 and 7, both inclusive, using another list comprehension. Finally, it sums up the remaining divisors using the built-in `sum()` function.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730530806, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=241, prompt_tokens=156, total_tokens=397))
