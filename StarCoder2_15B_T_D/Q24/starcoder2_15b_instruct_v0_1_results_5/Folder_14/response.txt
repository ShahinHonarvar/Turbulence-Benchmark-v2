If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 6 <= i <= 8:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we iterate through the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and check whether each integer is a divisor of `n` and is between 6 and 8, both inclusive. If so, we add it to the `sum`. Finally, we return the `sum`.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730530753, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=220, prompt_tokens=156, total_tokens=376))
