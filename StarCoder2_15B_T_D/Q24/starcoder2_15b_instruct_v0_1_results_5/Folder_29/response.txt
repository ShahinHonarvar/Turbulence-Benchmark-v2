The function should:\n- Take a positive integer as its argument\n- Find all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 43 and 77, both inclusive\n- Calculate the sum of these divisors\n- Return 0 if no divisors are found in the specified range\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = [d for d in range(1, num + 1) if num % d == 0 and 43 <= d <= 77]\n    return sum(divisors) if divisors else 0\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of divisors of the given number, filtering out those that are not between 43 and 77. It then checks if any divisors were found, and if so, returns the sum of the divisors. If no divisors were found, it returns 0.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730530849, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=245, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=403))
