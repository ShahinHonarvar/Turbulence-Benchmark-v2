Create an empty list to store the divisors.\n2. Iterate over all possible divisors from 1 to the given integer.\n3. If the divisor is between 70 and 93, both inclusive, add it to the list of divisors.\n4. If no divisors are found in the specified range, return 0.\n5. Otherwise, return the sum of the divisors.\n\nHere's how you could implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if 70 <= i <= 93 and n % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    if not divisors:\n        return 0\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\nThis function `sum_of_divisors_in_range` takes a positive integer `n` as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 70 and 93, both inclusive. The function iterates over all possible divisors from 1 to `n`, and checks if the divisor is between 70 and 93, both inclusive, and divides `n` evenly. If no divisors are found in the specified range, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the divisors.\n\nTo test this function, you can use the example you've provided:\n\n```python\nassert sum_of_divisors_in_range(100) == 165\nassert sum_of_divisors_in_range(1000) == 1955\nassert sum_of_divisors_in_range(10000) == 21075\nassert sum_of_divisors_in_range(100000) == 226005\nassert sum_of_divisors_in_range(1000000) == 2412510\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730529080, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=543, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=701))
