In this case, the text specification provides a function signature and a description of the function\'s behavior. The function signature specifies the name of the function and the type of its argument, while the description specifies the range of divisors to consider and the behavior in the case where no such divisors exist.\n\nTo parse the text specification, we can use a natural language processing library such as `spaCy` to extract the relevant information.\n\nOnce we have the information, we can generate the Python code using string formatting. The code should not contain any comments, so we can use the `docstring` to describe the function\'s behavior.\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    """\n    Returns the sum of all positive divisors of n that are between 113 and 991, inclusive.\n    If no such divisors exist, returns 0.\n    """\n    divisors = [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if n % i == 0 and 113 <= i <= 991]\n    return sum(divisors) if divisors else 0\n```\n\nThe Python code is delimited only by triple backticks to indicate the start and end of the code block. The code contains a function definition, a docstring, a list comprehension, and a conditional expression. The function definition specifies the name and the type of the argument. The docstring describes the function\'s behavior. The list comprehension generates a list of divisors of n that are between 113 and 991, inclusive. The conditional expression returns the sum of the divisors if they exist, or 0 otherwise.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730528770, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=390, prompt_tokens=160, total_tokens=550))
