ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code that solves the given problem, we need to understand the problem specification. The problem requires us to write a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 32 and 35, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 32 <= i <= 35:\n            sum_of_divisors += i\n    return sum_of_divisors\n```\n\nThe code defines a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument. It then iterates over all numbers from 1 to the given number (inclusive) and checks if they are divisors of the given number and are within the specified range. If a divisor is found, it is added to the `sum_of_divisors` variable. Finally, the `sum_of_divisors` variable is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730528981, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=296, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=454))
