The function iterates through all numbers from 1 to the given number (inclusive) and checks if they are divisors of the given number. If they are divisors, the function checks if they are also in the specified range (between 11 and 56, both inclusive). If they are in the specified range, the function adds them to the sum. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730528800, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=255, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=413))
