If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the integers from 1 to the given integer `n`, and checks if each integer is a divisor of `n` using the modulo operator. If the integer is a divisor of `n` and is between 5 and 7, both inclusive, it is added to the `sum_of_divisors`.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730529103, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=242, prompt_tokens=156, total_tokens=398))
