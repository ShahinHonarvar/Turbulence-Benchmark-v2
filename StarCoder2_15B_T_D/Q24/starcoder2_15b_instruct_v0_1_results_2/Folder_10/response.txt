Define a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument.\n2. Use a for loop to iterate over all possible divisors of the given integer.\n3. Check if the current divisor is between 60 and 86, both inclusive.\n4. If it is, add it to a running sum.\n5. Return the final sum.\n6. Call the function with a given integer to test its functionality.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 60 <= i <= 86:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```\n\nThis implementation defines a function `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument. It uses a for loop to iterate over all possible divisors of the given integer, checks if the current divisor is between 60 and 86, both inclusive, and adds it to a running sum if it is. Finally, it returns the final sum.\n\nTo test the functionality of this function, you can call it with a given integer and compare its output with the expected sum of divisors:\n\n```python\nassert sum_of_divisors_in_range(100) == 240\nassert sum_of_divisors_in_range(50) == 136\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730528577, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=386, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=544))
