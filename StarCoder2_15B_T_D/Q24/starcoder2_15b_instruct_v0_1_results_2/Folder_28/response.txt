If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function using Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 16 <= i <= 53:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```\n\nThe function `sum_of_divisors_in_range` takes a positive integer `n` as its argument. It initializes a `sum` variable to 0, and then iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop. For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` (using the modulo operator) and if it is also in the specified range (using the `and` operator). If both conditions are met, `i` is added to the `sum`. The function returns the final `sum` value.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730528719, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=286, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=444))
