ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code according to the text specification, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the text specification: The text specification states that we need to create a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument. The function should return the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 59 and 88, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\n2. Identify the key steps: The key steps involved in this task are:\n    - Define the `sum_of_divisors_in_range` function, which takes a positive integer as its argument.\n    - Find all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 59 and 88, both inclusive.\n    - If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n    - Otherwise, return the sum of these divisors.\n\n3. Translate the steps into Python code: Here's how you can translate the key steps into Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0 and 59 <= i <= 88]\n    if not divisors:\n        return 0\n    return sum(divisors)\n```\n\n4. Ensure that the code follows the specifications: Verify that the code follows the specifications mentioned in the text specification.\n\n5. Delimit the code with triple backticks: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere's the Python code that follows the specifications mentioned in the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0 and 59 <= i <= 88]\n    if not divisors:\n        return 0\n    return sum(divisors)\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730528954, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=457, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=615))
