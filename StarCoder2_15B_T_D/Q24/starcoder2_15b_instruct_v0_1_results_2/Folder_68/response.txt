If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere's how you can create the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(number):\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(3, number + 1):\n        if number % i == 0:\n            sum_of_divisors += i\n    return sum_of_divisors\n```\n\nThe function'sum_of_divisors_in_range' takes a positive integer as its argument. It then iterates through the range of integers from 3 to the given number, including the number itself. For each integer in this range, it checks if the given number is divisible by the integer. If it is, the integer is added to the sum_of_divisors variable. Finally, the function returns the sum_of_divisors value.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730529001, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=248, prompt_tokens=156, total_tokens=404))
