If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(number):\n    """\n    Returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given number that are between 19 and 69, both inclusive.\n    If no such divisors exist, returns 0.\n    """\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, number + 1):\n        if number % i == 0 and 19 <= i <= 69:\n            sum_of_divisors += i\n    return sum_of_divisors\n```\n\nThe code iterates through all numbers from 1 to the given number, and for each divisor, it checks if it is between 19 and 69. If it is, it adds it to the sum. Finally, the function returns the sum of all divisors in the specified range.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730528104, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=282, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=440))
