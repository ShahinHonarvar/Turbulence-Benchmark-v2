It then uses a for loop to iterate over all possible divisors of the given integer and checks if they are between 48 and 92, both inclusive. If they are, the divisor is added to the total variable. Finally, the total is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730528453, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=166, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=324))
