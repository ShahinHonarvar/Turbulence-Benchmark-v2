If no divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 70 <= i <= 72:\n            sum_of_divisors += i\n\n    return sum_of_divisors\n```\n\nThe code first checks if the input number is positive. If it is not, it returns 0 immediately. If it is positive, it initializes the sum of divisors to 0.\n\nThen, it loops through all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` (by checking if `n` modulo `i` is 0) and if `i` is in the specified range (by checking if `70 <= i <= 72`). If both conditions are met, `i` is added to the sum of divisors.\n\nFinally, the sum of divisors is returned. If no divisors were found in the specified range, the function returns 0.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730528167, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=336, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=494))
