ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="The instruction asks you to write a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 48 and 60, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nTo solve this problem, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument.\n2. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.\n3. Iterate over all numbers from 48 to 60, inclusive.\n4. For each number, check if it is a divisor of the given integer.\n5. If it is, add it to the `sum` variable.\n6. Return the `sum` variable.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(48, 61):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    return sum\n```\n\nThis function iterates over all numbers from 48 to 60, inclusive, and checks if they are divisors of the given integer. If they are, they are added to the `sum` variable. Finally, the `sum` variable is returned.\n\nNote that the function name, argument, and return type are provided in the instruction.
