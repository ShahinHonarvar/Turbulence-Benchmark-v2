Define a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer `n` as its argument.\n2. Create an empty list to store the divisors of `n`.\n3. Iterate through all the integers from 1 to `n`, and if the integer divides `n` evenly, add it to the list of divisors.\n4. Filter the divisors list to keep only the divisors that are between 4 and 8, both inclusive.\n5. Sum up the filtered divisors and return the result.\n6. Handle the corner case when no divisors are in the specified range by returning 0.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    filtered_divisors = [d for d in divisors if 4 <= d <= 8]\n    return sum(filtered_divisors) if filtered_divisors else 0\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730529525, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=323, prompt_tokens=156, total_tokens=479))
