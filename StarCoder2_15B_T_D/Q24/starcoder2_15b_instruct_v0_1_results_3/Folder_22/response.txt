Determine the range of divisors to consider. In this case, we want to sum up the divisors that are between 4 and 7, inclusive.\n2. Iterate over all possible divisors of the given number.\n3. Check if each divisor is within the specified range.\n4. If it is, add it to the sum.\n5. Return the sum at the end.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(number):\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, number + 1):\n        if number % i == 0 and 4 <= i <= 7:\n            sum_of_divisors += i\n    return sum_of_divisors\n```\n\nThis implementation iterates over all possible divisors of the given number and checks if each divisor is within the specified range. If it is, it is added to the `sum_of_divisors`. At the end, the `sum_of_divisors` is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730529357, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=276, prompt_tokens=156, total_tokens=432))
