ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To solve this problem, we need to write a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument. The function should find all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 46 and 89, both inclusive, and calculate the sum of these divisors. If no divisors are found in the specified range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere's how we can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 46 <= i <= 89:\n            sum_of_divisors += i\n    return sum_of_divisors\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we iterate through all integers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop. For each integer `i`, we check if it is a divisor of `n` by checking if `n` modulo `i` is 0. If it is a divisor, we check if it is in the specified range by checking if `46 <= i <= 89`. If it is in the range, we add it to the `sum_of_divisors`. Finally, we return the `sum_of_divisors` at the end of the function.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730529721, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=312, prompt_tokens=158, total_tokens=470))
