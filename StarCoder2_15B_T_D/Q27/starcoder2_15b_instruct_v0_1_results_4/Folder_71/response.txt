Understand the specification: The specification states that you need to create a function called `insert_after_index` that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 76 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 70.\n2. Break down the specification: The specification can be broken down into smaller parts, such as the function name, the argument name, the index to insert the element, and the value to be inserted.\n3. Write the code: Using the information from the specification, you can write the code to create the function, accept the argument, and insert the value at the specified index.\n4. Test the code: To ensure that the code meets the specification, you can write tests that verify that the function works as expected.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code that satisfies the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_index(lst):\n    lst.insert(71, 76)\n    return lst\n```\n\nThis code creates a function called `insert_after_index` that takes one argument, a list. The function inserts the value 76 at the index immediately succeeding index 70 and returns the modified list.\n\nYou can test the code by calling the function with a list and verifying that the returned list has the expected elements:\n\n```python\nlst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nresult = insert_after_index(lst)\nexpected = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 76]\nassert result == expected\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730538261, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=402, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=550))
