Take one argument, a list.\n2. Return a list that is identical to the given list except that 74 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 21.\n3. The returned list should have one more element than the given list.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function `insert_after_index` in Python:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_index(lst: list) -> list:\n    return lst[:22] + [74] + lst[22:]\n```\n\nThe function `insert_after_index` takes a list as its argument. It returns a new list that is the same as the given list except that 74 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 21. The function uses list slicing to split the list into three parts: the first part up to index 21, the second part consisting of the single element 74, and the third part starting from index 21. The function then concatenates these three parts together using the `+` operator to form the new list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730538189, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=252, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=400))
