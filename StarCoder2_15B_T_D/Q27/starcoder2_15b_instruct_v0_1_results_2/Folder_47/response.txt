In this case, the text specification is very simple: we need to write a function called `insert_after_index` that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 520.11 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 64 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.\n\nHere's how we can create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_index(lst):\n    index = 64\n    value = 520.11\n    return lst[:index + 1] + [value] + lst[index + 1:]\n```\n\nThis code creates a function called `insert_after_index` that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 520.11 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 64. The function uses list slicing to insert the value at the appropriate index.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730537145, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=237, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=389))
