In this case, the text specification says that we need to write a function called `insert_after_index` that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that `[90, 76]` has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 35.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code that satisfies the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_index(lst):\n    lst.insert(36, 90)\n    lst.insert(37, 76)\n    return lst\n```\n\nThe `insert` method inserts an element at the specified index, so we can use it to insert `[90, 76]` at the index immediately succeeding index 35. We need to insert them as separate calls to `insert` because we want to insert them at the same index, and the index will change after the first insertion.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730537222, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=222, prompt_tokens=153, total_tokens=375))
