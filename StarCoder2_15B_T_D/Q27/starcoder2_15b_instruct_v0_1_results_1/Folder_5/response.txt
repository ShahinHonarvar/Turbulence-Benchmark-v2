The text specification is delimited by triple backticks, so we can write the Python code directly underneath.\n\nThe function `insert_after_index` takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 15 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 99. Since the returned list should have one more element than the given list, we can use the `insert` method to insert 15 at index 99 + 1.\n\nHere\'s how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_index(lst):\n    """\n    Insert 15 after index 99 in the given list and return the modified list.\n    """\n    lst.insert(100, 15)\n    return lst\n```\n\nThe `insert` method takes two arguments: the index at which to insert the element, and the element to insert. In this case, we want to insert 15 at index 99 + 1, so we pass 100 as the index and 15 as the element.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730536423, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=250, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=398))
