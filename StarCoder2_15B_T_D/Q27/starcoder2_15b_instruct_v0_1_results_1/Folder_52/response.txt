ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, you need to understand the text specification and the desired outcome. From the text specification, you can see that a function called `insert_after_index` is being described. This function takes a list as an argument and returns a list that is identical except that 72.27 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 97.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the `insert_after_index` function:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_index(list):\n    index = 97\n    value = 72.27\n    list.insert(index + 1, value)\n    return list\n```\n\nThe `insert_after_index` function takes a list as an argument and inserts the value 72.27 at the index immediately succeeding index 97. The `insert` method of the list object is used to insert the value at the specified index. The function then returns the modified list.\n\nNote that the code does not contain any comments and is delimited only by triple backticks, as specified in the text specification.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730536673, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=236, prompt_tokens=151, total_tokens=387))
