In this case, we want to insert `285.4` at the index immediately succeeding index `370`, so we pass `371` as the first argument and `285.4` as the second argument.\n\nThe `insert()` method inserts the new element at the specified index, shifting the elements that were previously at that index and any subsequent indices one position to the right. In this case, the list will grow by one element, with `285.4` inserted at index `371` and the elements previously at index `371` and subsequent indices shifted one position to the right.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730538637, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=238, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=390))
