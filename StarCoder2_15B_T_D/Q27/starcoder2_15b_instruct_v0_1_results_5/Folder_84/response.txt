It creates a new list by copying the given list using the `copy()` method. Then, the function inserts the elements [148, 145] at the index immediately succeeding index 183 using the `insert()` method. Finally, the function returns the new list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730538831, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=317, prompt_tokens=156, total_tokens=473))
