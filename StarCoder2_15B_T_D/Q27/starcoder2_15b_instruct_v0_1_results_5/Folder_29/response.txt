ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the given instruction, we have to create a Python function called `insert_after_index` that takes a list as input and returns a new list with the number 36 inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 96. The returned list should have one more element than the given list.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the `list.insert()` method to insert the number 36 at the desired index. However, we need to be careful not to insert it at index 96 directly, as the given list may have a different length than the expected one. Instead, we can find the index of 96 relative to the length of the given list, and then insert the number at the corresponding index in the returned list.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `insert_after_index`:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_index(lst):\n    new_lst = lst.copy()\n    index = 96 - len(lst) + 1\n    new_lst.insert(index, 36)\n    return new_lst\n```\n\nThis function takes a list as input and returns a new list with the number 36 inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 96 in the returned list. The returned list has one more element than the given list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730538541, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=279, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=427))
