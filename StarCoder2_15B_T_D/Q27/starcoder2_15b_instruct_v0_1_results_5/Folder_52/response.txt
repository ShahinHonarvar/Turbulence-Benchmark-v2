Parse the text specification: The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets, which indicates it is a string. You need to remove the angle brackets and parse the string.\n2. Generate the Python code: The text specification indicates that a function called `insert_after_index` should be created that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 72.27 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 97.\n3. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks, which indicates that the code is surrounded by a string literal.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_index(lst):\n    """\n    Insert 72.27 into the list at index 98.\n    """\n    lst.insert(98, 72.27)\n    return lst\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a function called `insert_after_index` that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 72.27 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 97. The function is delimited only by triple backticks, indicating that it is surrounded by a string literal, and does not contain any comments.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730538666, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=298, prompt_tokens=151, total_tokens=449))
