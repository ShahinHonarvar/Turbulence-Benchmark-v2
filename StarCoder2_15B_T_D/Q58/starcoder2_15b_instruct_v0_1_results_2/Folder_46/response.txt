ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To solve this problem, you can use a nested loop to iterate through all submatrices of the given matrix and count the number of submatrices that contain exactly 144 integers. Here are the steps to reason about this solution:\n\n1. Iterate through all submatrices of the given matrix: You can use two nested loops to iterate through all possible submatrices. The outer loop iterates through all possible starting rows, and the inner loop iterates through all possible starting columns.\n2. Count the number of submatrices that contain 144 integers: For each submatrix, you can use a nested loop to iterate through its rows and columns and count the number of integers. If the count equals 144, you can increment the submatrix count.\n3. Return the count: After iterating through all submatrices, you can return the count of submatrices that contain 144 integers.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement the'submatrix_with_n_numbers' function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    n = 144  # Number of integers in each submatrix\n    submatrix_count = 0  # Initialize the count of submatrices with 144 integers\n    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - n + 1):\n        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - n + 1):\n            submatrix = matrix[i:i+n, j:j+n]\n            if submatrix.size == n:\n                submatrix_count += 1\n    return submatrix_count\n```\n\nThis code iterates through all possible submatrices of the given matrix and counts the number of submatrices that contain exactly 144 integers. It uses the shape attribute of the matrix to determine the number of rows and columns, and the size attribute of the submatrix to check if it contains exactly 144 integers.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730676623, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=418, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=570))
