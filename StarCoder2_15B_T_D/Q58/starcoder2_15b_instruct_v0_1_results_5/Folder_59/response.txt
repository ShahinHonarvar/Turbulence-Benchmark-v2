We then get the number of rows and columns in the matrix using the'shape' attribute of the matrix.\n\nNext, we set the size of the submatrix we want to find to 76, and initialize a variable'submatrix_count' to keep track of the number of submatrices we find. Then, we loop through the rows and columns of the matrix, and for each submatrix of the desired size, we increase the'submatrix_count' variable by 1.\n\nFinally, we return the'submatrix_count' variable, which is the number of submatrices of the desired size that were found in the given matrix.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730679401, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=338, prompt_tokens=151, total_tokens=489))
