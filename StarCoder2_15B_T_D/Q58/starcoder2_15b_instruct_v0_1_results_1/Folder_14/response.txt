Understand the problem statement: The problem statement clearly states that I need to write a Python function called `submatrix_with_n_numbers` that takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument and returns the count of all submatrices that contain 84 integers.\n2. Understand the constraints: The function should return 0 if no such submatrix is found.\n3. Understand the expected input and output: The input is a two-dimensional numpy matrix and the output is an integer representing the count of submatrices that contain 84 integers.\n4. Understand the test cases: The problem statement does not provide any test cases, so I will need to come up with my own test cases to ensure the correctness of the solution.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    if matrix.size < 84:\n        return 0\n    n_rows, n_cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for row in range(n_rows - 2):\n        for col in range(n_cols - 2):\n            submatrix = matrix[row:row+3, col:col+3]\n            if submatrix.size == 84:\n                count += 1\n\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument and returns the count of all submatrices that contain 84 integers. If the matrix size is less than 84, it returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates over all possible submatrices of size 3x3 and checks if they contain 84 integers. If a submatrix contains 84 integers, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the `count` variable as the result.\n\nTo test the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function, I will use the following test cases:\n\n```python\nmatrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\nassert submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix) == 0\nmatrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])\nassert submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix) == 1\nmatrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36], [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45], [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54], [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63], [64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72], [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81]])\nassert submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix) == 9\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730675498, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=946, prompt_tokens=151, total_tokens=1097))
