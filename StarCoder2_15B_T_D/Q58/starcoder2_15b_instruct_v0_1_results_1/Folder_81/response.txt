To achieve this, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a function called `submatrix_with_n_numbers` that takes a numpy matrix as input.\n2. Iterate over all submatrices of the given matrix using a nested for loop.\n3. For each submatrix, calculate its size and check if it contains 97 integers.\n4. If the submatrix contains 97 integers, increment the count.\n5. Return the count at the end of the function.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements the above steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):\n            for k in range(i, matrix.shape[0]):\n                for l in range(j, matrix.shape[1]):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if submatrix.size == 97:\n                        count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThe code iterates over all possible submatrices of the given matrix using nested for loops. For each submatrix, it checks if it contains 97 integers. If yes, it increments the count. At the end, the function returns the count of all submatrices that contain 97 integers.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730676028, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=344, prompt_tokens=151, total_tokens=495))
