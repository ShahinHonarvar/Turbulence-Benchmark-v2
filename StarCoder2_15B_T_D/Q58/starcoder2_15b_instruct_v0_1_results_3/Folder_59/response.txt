To achieve this, you would need to iterate over the matrix and consider all possible submatrices of size 76. Here's how you can reason about the solution:\n\n1. Iterate over the matrix: Use nested loops to iterate over each row and column of the matrix.\n2. Consider all possible submatrices of size 76: For each element in the matrix, consider all submatrices that include that element and have a size of 76. You can do this by using another nested loop to iterate over the remaining 75 elements.\n3. Check if the submatrix contains 76 integers: Within the inner loop, check if the submatrix contains 76 integers. You can do this by keeping a counter and incrementing it each time an integer is encountered.\n4. If the submatrix contains 76 integers, return 1: If the submatrix contains 76 integers, return 1 to indicate that a submatrix with 76 integers was found. You can use a variable to store the count of submatrices and increment it each time a submatrix with 76 integers is found.\n5. Return the count of submatrices: After iterating over the entire matrix, return the count of submatrices that contain 76 integers.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(matrix)):\n        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):\n            for k in range(i, len(matrix)):\n                for l in range(j, len(matrix[0])):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if submatrix.size == 76:\n                        count += 1\n\n    return count\n```\n\nThe `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function iterates over the matrix and considers all possible submatrices of size 76. For each submatrix, it checks if it contains 76 integers. If it does, it increments the count of submatrices. The function then returns the count of submatrices that contain 76 integers.\n\nNote that the implementation assumes that the matrix is a two-dimensional numpy array.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730677643, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=545, prompt_tokens=151, total_tokens=696))
