The function should return the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 42 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return 0.\n\nI created a function called `submatrix_with_n_numbers` that takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument. The function iterates over the matrix and extracts all 2x2 submatrices. For each submatrix, it checks if the sum of the integers is equal to 42. If it is, it increments the `count` variable by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of `count`.\n\nThe Python code should not contain any comments because the text specification already provides the necessary information. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks because that\'s how you can create code blocks in Markdown.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730677709, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=367, prompt_tokens=151, total_tokens=518))
