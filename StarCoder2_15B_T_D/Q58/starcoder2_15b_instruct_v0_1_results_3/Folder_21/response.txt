You also need to know how to use numpy to manipulate arrays and matrices.\n\nHere's how you could write the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    n_rows, n_cols = matrix.shape\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n_rows - 3):\n        for j in range(n_cols - 3):\n            submatrix = matrix[i:i+4, j:j+4]\n            if submatrix.size == 139:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `submatrix_with_n_numbers` that takes one argument, a two-dimensional numpy matrix. It iterates over all submatrices of size 4x4 and checks if they contain exactly 139 integers. If a submatrix with 139 integers is found, the count is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the count of submatrices with 139 integers.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730677294, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=252, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=404))
