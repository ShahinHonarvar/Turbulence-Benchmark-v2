It does so by first filtering out the alphabetic characters from the string, sorting them based on their ASCII values, and then returning the 15th smallest character. Note that the function assumes the string contains at least 15 alphabetic characters between indices 17 and 86.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730540376, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=175, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=321))
