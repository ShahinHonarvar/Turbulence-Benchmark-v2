The text specification states that we need to create a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes a string of distinct characters as an argument and returns the character with the 14th smallest ASCII value among those characters that occur between indices 60 and 83, both inclusive, in the given string.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the text specification, assuming that the input string is stored in a variable called `s`:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    sorted_chars = sorted(s[60:84])\n    return sorted_chars[13]\n```\n\nIn this code, we first extract the substring from index 60 to 83 using string slicing. Then, we sort the extracted substring using the built-in `sorted` function. Finally, we return the 14th smallest character in the sorted substring.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730540278, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=212, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=358))
