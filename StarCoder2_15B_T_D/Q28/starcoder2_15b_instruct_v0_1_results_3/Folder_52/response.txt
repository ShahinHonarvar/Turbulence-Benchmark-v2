You will need to write a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes a string of distinct characters as an argument. The function should return the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value among those characters that occur between indices 46 to 72, both inclusive, in the string.\n\nHere's how you could write the Python code to fulfill the instruction:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    characters = [char for char in string[46:73]]\n    characters.sort(key=ord)\n    return characters[14]\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730540192, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=152, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=298))
