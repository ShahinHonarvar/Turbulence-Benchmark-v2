The function `return_nth_smallest_ascii` is defined to take a single argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 7th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 52 to 79, both inclusive.\n\nHere is the Python code that fulfills the requirement:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    sorted_chars = sorted(string[52:80])\n    return sorted_chars[6]\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use the `sorted` function to sort the characters in the string from smallest to largest. We then select the 7th character in the sorted list using the index `6`. Note that the indices in the specification are 0-based, whereas the indices in Python are 0-based. Therefore, we need to use the index `6` to access the 7th character in the sorted list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730540368, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=225, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=370))
