To restrict the search to a specific range of indices, we can slice the string to extract the substring between indices 18 and 45, and then apply the same logic to that substring.\n\nWe can implement this in Python using a combination of built-in functions and the `ord()` function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    """\n    Returns the character with the 7th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string\n    that occur between indices 18 and 45, both inclusive.\n    """\n    return sorted(s[18:46], key=ord)[6]\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730540556, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=190, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=335))
