The function `return_nth_smallest_ascii` takes a string of distinct characters and returns the character with the 10th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 0 to 9, both inclusive.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    sorted_string = sorted(string)\n    return sorted_string[9]\n```\n\nThe `sorted` function sorts the characters in the string in ascending order based on their ASCII values. The slicing operator (`[9]`) selects the 10th character from the sorted string, which is the character with the 10th smallest ASCII value.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730540782, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=177, prompt_tokens=144, total_tokens=321))
