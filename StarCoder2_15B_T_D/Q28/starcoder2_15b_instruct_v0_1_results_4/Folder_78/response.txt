The function should return the character with the 14th smallest ASCII value among the characters in the string that occur between indices 0 and 87, both inclusive.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    sorted_characters = sorted(s[0:88])\n    return sorted_characters[13]\n```\n\nIn this code, we first extract the substring of the string `s` between indices 0 and 87, both inclusive. We then sort the extracted substring using the built-in `sorted` function. This sorts the characters in the substring based on their ASCII values.\n\nNext, we return the 14th smallest character in the sorted substring. This is done by indexing into the sorted substring at index 13.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730540884, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=208, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=353))
