Extract the characters from the string that occur between indices 17 to 86, both inclusive.\n2. Sort the extracted characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n3. Return the 15th character from the sorted list.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    extracted_chars = [char for char in string[17:87]]\n    sorted_chars = sorted(extracted_chars)\n    return sorted_chars[14]\n```\n\nThis implementation extracts the characters from the string that occur between indices 17 to 86, both inclusive, then sorts them in ascending order based on their ASCII values. Finally, it returns the 15th character from the sorted list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730539821, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=243, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=389))
