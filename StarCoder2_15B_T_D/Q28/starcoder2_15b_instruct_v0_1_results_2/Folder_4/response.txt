Extract the characters between indices 9 and 22 from the input string.\n2. Sort those characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n3. Return the character at index 3 (zero-based) from the sorted list.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the above steps:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    sub_string = s[9:23]\n    sorted_string = sorted(sub_string)\n    return sorted_string[3]\n```\n\nThis function takes a string of distinct characters as input and returns the character with the fourth smallest ASCII value among those characters that occur between indices 9 and 22, both inclusive. The function extracts the substring between indices 9 and 22 using string slicing. It then sorts the substring in ascending order based on the ASCII values of the characters using the built-in `sorted()` function. Finally, it returns the character at index 3 from the sorted list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730539450, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=229, prompt_tokens=144, total_tokens=373))
