Extract the characters within the specified range: Use slicing to extract the characters between indices 17 and 65, both inclusive, from the input string.\n2. Sort the characters by ASCII value: Use the built-in `sorted` function to sort the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n3. Return the 8th smallest character: After sorting the characters, select the 8th smallest character from the sorted list.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    characters = string[17:66]  # Extract characters between indices 17 and 65, both inclusive\n    sorted_characters = sorted(characters)  # Sort the characters by ASCII value\n    return sorted_characters[7]  # Return the 8th smallest character\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the characters between indices 17 and 65, both inclusive, from the input string. It then sorts the characters by ASCII value using the built-in `sorted` function. Finally, it returns the 8th smallest character from the sorted list. Note that the indices are 0-based, so the actual range is from index 17 to 65, inclusive.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730539915, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=307, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=452))
