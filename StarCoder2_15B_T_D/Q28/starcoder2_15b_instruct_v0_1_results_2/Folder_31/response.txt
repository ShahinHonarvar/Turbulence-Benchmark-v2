Then, we can sort the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values. Finally, we can return the character at the 18th index of the sorted list.\n\nHere is the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    substring = string[10:83]  # Extract the substring between indices 10 and 82\n    sorted_chars = sorted(substring)  # Sort the characters in ascending order\n    return sorted_chars[17]  # Return the character at the 18th index\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- `string[10:83]` extracts the substring between indices 10 and 82, both inclusive.\n- `sorted(substring)` sorts the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n- `sorted_chars[17]` returns the character at the 18th index of the sorted list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730539555, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=234, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=380))
