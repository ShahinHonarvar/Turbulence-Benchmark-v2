The function should return the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 46 to 72, both inclusive. The Python code should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere is the implementation of the Python function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    characters = [char for char in string[46:73]]\n    characters.sort(key=lambda x: ord(x))\n    return characters[14]\n```\n\nThe code extracts a substring from the given string using slicing and then creates a list of characters between indices 46 and 72. The list of characters is sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values using the `ord` function. The 15th smallest character is then returned.\n\nThe function `return_nth_smallest_ascii` takes a string of distinct characters as an argument.
