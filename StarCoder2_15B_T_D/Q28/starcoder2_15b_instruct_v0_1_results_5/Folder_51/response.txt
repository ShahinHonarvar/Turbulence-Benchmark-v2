The problem statement provides a detailed explanation of the expected behavior, including the function name, arguments, and return value.\n\nThe problem specification also provides some additional information that can help us reason about the solution. In this case, the specification states that the function should return the character with the 9th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 10 to 73, both inclusive.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function as specified:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    chars = sorted(s[10:74])\n    return chars[8]\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730541272, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=152, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=297))
