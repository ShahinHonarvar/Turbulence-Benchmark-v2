The function should return the character with the 6th smallest ASCII value among those characters that occur between indices 25 and 64, both inclusive, in the given string.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    characters = [c for c in string if 25 <= string.index(c) <= 64]\n    characters.sort(key=lambda x: ord(x))\n    return characters[5]\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The function takes a string as an argument.\n- We extract the characters from the string that occur between indices 25 and 64, both inclusive, using a list comprehension.\n- We sort the extracted characters by their ASCII values using the `ord` function.\n- We return the 6th smallest character from the sorted list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730541110, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=231, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=376))
