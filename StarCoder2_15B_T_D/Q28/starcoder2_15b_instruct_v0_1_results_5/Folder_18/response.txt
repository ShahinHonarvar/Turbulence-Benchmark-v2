The instruction tells us to create a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 5th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 51 to 60, both inclusive.\n\nThe specification tells us that the Python code should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks. This means that we should write the Python code such that it is easy to understand without any comments and is well-formatted.\n\nHere's how we can create the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    characters = sorted(s[51:61])\n    return characters[4]\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730541091, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=180, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=325))
