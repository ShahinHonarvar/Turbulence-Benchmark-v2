Extract the characters between indices 0 to 87 from the input string.\n2. Sort the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n3. Return the 14th character from the sorted list.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    extracted_chars = string[0:87]\n    sorted_chars = sorted(extracted_chars)\n    return sorted_chars[13]\n```\n\nThe `return_nth_smallest_ascii` function takes a string as input and returns the character with the 14th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 0 to 87. The function first extracts the characters between indices 0 to 87 using string slicing and then sorts the extracted characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values using the built-in `sorted` function. Finally, it returns the 14th character from the sorted list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730541412, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=261, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=406))
