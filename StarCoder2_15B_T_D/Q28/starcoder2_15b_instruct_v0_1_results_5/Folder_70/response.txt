ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, you need to first understand the problem specification. The function `return_nth_smallest_ascii` takes a string of distinct characters as an argument. The function should return the character with the 14th smallest ASCII value among those characters that occur between indices 28 and 54, both inclusive, in the input string.\n\nTo write Python code that meets the specification, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Extract the characters between indices 28 and 54, both inclusive, from the input string.\n2. Sort the extracted characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n3. Return the 14th character from the sorted list.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    extracted_chars = string[28:55]  # Extract characters between indices 28 and 54\n    sorted_chars = sorted(extracted_chars)  # Sort the extracted characters in ascending order\n    return sorted_chars[13]  # Return the 14th character from the sorted list\n```\n\nThis function `return_nth_smallest_ascii` takes a string of distinct characters as an argument. It extracts the characters between indices 28 and 54, both inclusive, from the input string. It then sorts the extracted characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.
