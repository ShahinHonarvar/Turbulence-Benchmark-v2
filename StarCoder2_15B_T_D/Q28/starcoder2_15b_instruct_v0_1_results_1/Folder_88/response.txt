ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we first need to understand the problem specification. From the text specification, we can see that we need to write a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes a string of distinct characters as an argument. The function should return the character with the 14th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 38 and 64, both inclusive.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    characters = [c for c in string[38:65]]\n    characters.sort(key=lambda c: ord(c))\n    return characters[13]\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730539363, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=156, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=302))
