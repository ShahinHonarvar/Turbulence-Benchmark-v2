Extract the substring of the given string that contains the characters between indices 9 to 22, both inclusive.\n2. Sort the characters in the extracted substring in ascending order based on their ASCII values.\n3. Return the character at the 4th index of the sorted substring.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n    substring = string[9:23]\n    sorted_substring = sorted(substring)\n    return sorted_substring[3]\n```\n\nThis function extracts the substring of the given string that contains the characters between indices 9 to 22, both inclusive. It then sorts the characters in the extracted substring in ascending order based on their ASCII values. Finally, it returns the character at the 4th index of the sorted substring, which is the character with the 4th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 9 to 22.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730538940, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=261, prompt_tokens=144, total_tokens=405))
