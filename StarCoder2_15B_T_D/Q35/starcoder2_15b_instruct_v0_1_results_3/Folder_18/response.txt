Once we encounter a character that has more than one occurrence between indices 56 and 90, we can remove all occurrences of that character from the string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    char_counts = {}\n    for char in string:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    for i, char in enumerate(string):\n        if char_counts[char] > 1 and 56 < i < 90:\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first count the occurrences of each character in the string using a dictionary. Then, we loop through the string again, and for each character that occurs more than once between indices 56 and 90, we remove all occurrences of that character from the string using the `replace` method. Finally, we return the altered string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730561766, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=242, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=405))
