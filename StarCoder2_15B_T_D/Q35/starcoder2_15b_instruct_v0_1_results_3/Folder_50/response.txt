It then iterates through the characters in the original string, and if the character occurs only once or is not in the range 13 to 76, it is added to the result. The function returns the resulting string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730562042, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=240, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=403))
