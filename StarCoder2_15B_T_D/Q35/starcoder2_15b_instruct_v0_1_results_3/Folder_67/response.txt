It then iterates through the string to identify characters that occur more than once between indices 44 and 67 and stores their indices in `indices_to_remove`. Finally, it constructs a new string by iterating through the original string and skipping the indices stored in `indices_to_remove`.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730562179, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=314, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=477))
