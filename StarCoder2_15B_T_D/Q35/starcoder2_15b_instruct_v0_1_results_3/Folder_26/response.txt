If a character occurs more than once between indices 68 and 99, we can remove all occurrences of that character from the string. We can use a list to store the characters in the final string and then join the characters to form the final string.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    char_count = {}\n    final_chars = []\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(string):\n        if i >= 68 and i < 99:\n            char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(string):\n        if i >= 68 and i < 99 and char_count[char] > 1:\n            continue\n        final_chars.append(char)\n\n    return ''.join(final_chars)\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The `char_count` dictionary is used to store the count of each character in the string.\n- The `final_chars` list is used to store the characters in the final string.\n- The `for` loop iterates through the characters in the string and updates the `char_count` dictionary.\n- The second `for` loop iterates through the characters in the string again and checks if the character occurs more than once between indices 68 and 99. If so, it is skipped, otherwise, it is appended to the `final_chars` list.\n- The final string is returned by joining the characters in the `final_chars` list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730561837, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=378, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=541))
