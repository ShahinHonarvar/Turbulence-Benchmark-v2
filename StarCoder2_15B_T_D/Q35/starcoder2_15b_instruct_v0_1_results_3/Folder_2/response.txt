Then, iterate through the string, keeping track of the indices of each character. If a character occurs more than once between indices 72 and 93, remove all occurrences of that character from the string.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(text):\n    indices = {}\n    for i, c in enumerate(text):\n        if c not in indices:\n            indices[c] = []\n        indices[c].append(i)\n    for c, c_indices in indices.items():\n        if len(c_indices) > 1 and all(72 < i < 93 for i in c_indices):\n            text = text.replace(c, '')\n\n    return text\n```\n\nThe code iterates through the string, keeping track of the indices of each character in the dictionary `indices`. For each character, if it occurs more than once and all its indices are between 72 and 93, it removes all occurrences of that character from the string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730561659, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=243, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=406))
