Read the text specification carefully to understand the requirements.\n2. Break down the text specification into individual Python statements and expressions.\n3. Write the Python code to fulfill the requirements.\n4. Ensure that the Python code adheres to the specifications.\n\nHere's how you could implement the function `remove_repeat_chars` based on the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    char_counts = {}\n    for c in s:\n        char_counts[c] = char_counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n    repeated_chars = [c for c in char_counts if char_counts[c] > 1]\n    for c in repeated_chars:\n        s = s.replace(c, '')\n\n    return s\n```\n\nThis implementation of the function `remove_repeat_chars` uses the `str.replace()` method to remove repeated characters from a string. It first counts the occurrences of each character in the string, then identifies characters that occur more than once, and finally removes those characters from the string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730562264, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=250, prompt_tokens=165, total_tokens=415))
