It does so by first counting the occurrences of each character in the specified range. Then, it iterates through the characters with more than one occurrence and removes all occurrences of that character from the string. Finally, it returns the altered string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730562009, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=174, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=337))
