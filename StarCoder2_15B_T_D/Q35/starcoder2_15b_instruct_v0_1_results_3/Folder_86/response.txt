Then, it checks for characters that occur more than once between indices 19 and 32, and removes all occurrences of those characters from the string. Finally, it returns the altered string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730562339, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=212, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=375))
