The `re.escape` function is used to escape any special characters in the repeated characters, which ensures that they are treated as literal characters instead of special regular expression metacharacters. The `|` (pipe) character is used as a delimiter to combine the escaped repeated characters into a single regular expression pattern.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563039, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=213, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=376))
