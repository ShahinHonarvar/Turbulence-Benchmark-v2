We can then iterate over the characters in the string and maintain a set of characters that have already been seen. If a character has more than one occurrence and is not in the set of seen characters, we remove it from the string.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s: str) -> str:\n    """\n    Removes repeated characters from a string, preserving the order of characters.\n    """\n    cnt = Counter(s)\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n\n    for c in s:\n        if cnt[c] > 1 and c not in seen:\n            seen.add(c)\n            result.append(c)\n\n    return \'\'.join(result)\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563185, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=194, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=357))
