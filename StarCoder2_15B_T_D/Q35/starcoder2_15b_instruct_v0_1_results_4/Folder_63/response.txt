Extract the substring between indices 81 and 86 from the given string.\n2. Count the frequency of each character in the extracted substring.\n3. For each character that occurs more than once, remove all occurrences of that character from the original string.\n4. Return the updated string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string: str) -> str:\n    substring = string[81:86]\n    char_frequency = {}\n    for char in substring:\n        char_frequency[char] = char_frequency.get(char, 0) + 1\n    for char, frequency in char_frequency.items():\n        if frequency > 1:\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n\n    return string\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the substring between indices 81 and 86 from the given string. It then counts the frequency of each character in the substring. For each character that occurs more than once, it removes all occurrences of that character from the original string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The updated string is then returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730562969, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=294, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=457))
