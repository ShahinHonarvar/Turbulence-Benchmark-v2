The dictionary stores the character as the key and the number of occurrences as the value. For each character in the string, if the character is not in the dictionary, it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1. Otherwise, the count is increased by 1.\n\nAfter counting the occurrences, we iterate through the string again and filter out the repeated characters. We iterate through the string and check if a character is in the dictionary and has a count greater than 1. If so, we decrement the count. Otherwise, we add the character to the filtered character list.\n\nFinally, we join the filtered characters and return the resulting string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730562997, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=350, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=513))
