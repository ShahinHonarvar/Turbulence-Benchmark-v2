Count the occurrences of each character in the given string using a dictionary.\n2. Iterate through each character in the given string and check if its count is greater than 1 between indices 13 and 70, both exclusive.\n3. If the character meets the above criteria, remove all occurrences of that character from the string.\n4. Return the altered string.\n\nHere's how you can implement the above steps in Python:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    char_counts = {}\n    for c in s:\n        char_counts[c] = char_counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n    result = []\n    for c in s:\n        if char_counts[c] > 1 and 13 < s.index(c) < 70:\n            continue\n        result.append(c)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563802, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=247, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=410))
