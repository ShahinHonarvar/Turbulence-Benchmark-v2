ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the instruction, we can write a Python function named `remove_repeat_chars` that takes a string as an argument. Within the function, we would iterate through the string, keeping track of the number of occurrences of each character. If a character occurs more than once between indices 57 and 85, we would remove all occurrences of that character from the string.\n\nHere is the implementation of `remove_repeat_chars`:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    char_counts = {}\n    for c in s:\n        char_counts[c] = char_counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n\n    for c in char_counts:\n        if char_counts[c] > 1 and 57 < s.index(c) < 85:\n            s = s.replace(c, "")\n\n    return s\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563979, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=192, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=355))
