We can then iterate through the string, keeping track of the indices, and for each character that occurs more than once between indices 30 and 200, we can remove all occurrences of that character from the string.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef remove_repeat_chars(text: str) -> str:\n    """\n    Removes repeated characters in a given string between indices 30 and 200.\n    """\n    counter = Counter(text)\n    result = []\n    index = 0\n\n    for char in text:\n        if counter[char] == 1 or index < 30 or index >= 200:\n            result.append(char)\n        index += 1\n\n    return \'\'.join(result)\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563874, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=206, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=370))
