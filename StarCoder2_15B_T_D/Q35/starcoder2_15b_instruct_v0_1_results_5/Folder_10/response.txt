We can use a dictionary to store the character counts, and then iterate through the string again to remove the characters.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    char_counts = {}\n    for c in s:\n        char_counts[c] = char_counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n    for c in char_counts:\n        if char_counts[c] > 1 and 36 < s.index(c) < 54:\n            s = s.replace(c, '')\n\n    return s\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first count the occurrences of each character in the string using a dictionary. Then, we iterate through the string again, and for each character that occurs more than once and is between indices 36 and 54, we remove all occurrences of that character from the string. Finally, we return the altered string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563302, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=251, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=414))
