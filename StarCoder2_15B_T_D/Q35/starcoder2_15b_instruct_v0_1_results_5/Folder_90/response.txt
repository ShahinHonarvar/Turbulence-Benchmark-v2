The function should remove all occurrences of a character if it occurs more than once between indices 306 and 807, both exclusive, while preserving the order of all characters in the string.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    counts = {}\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if i >= 306 and i < 807:\n            counts[c] = counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if i >= 306 and i < 807 and counts[c] > 1:\n            s = s[:i] + s[i + 1:]\n            counts[c] -= 1\n    return s\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563949, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=213, prompt_tokens=165, total_tokens=378))
