ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the given string. Then, we can iterate through the string and build the result using a list. If a character occurs more than once between indices 0 and 10, we can skip it. Otherwise, we can append it to the result.\n\nHere\'s how we can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    counts = {}\n    for c in s:\n        counts[c] = counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n    result = []\n    for c in s:\n        if counts[c] == 1 or s.index(c) < 10:\n            result.append(c)\n    return "".join(result)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a dictionary `counts` to count the occurrences of each character in the given string. Then, we iterate through the string and build the result using a list. If a character occurs more than once between indices 0 and 10, we skip it. Otherwise, we append it to the result. Finally, we return the result as a string by joining the characters in the list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563701, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=256, prompt_tokens=162, total_tokens=418))
