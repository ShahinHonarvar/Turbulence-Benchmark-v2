The function should take a string as an argument and remove repeated characters in a specific range. The range is defined by the indices 68 and 99, both exclusive. This means that the function should remove repeated characters that occur between indices 68 and 99 (not including 68 and 99 themselves).\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    char_counts = {}\n    for char in s[68:99]:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    repeated_chars = [char for char in char_counts if char_counts[char] > 1]\n    return "".join([char for char in s if char not in repeated_chars])\n```\n\nThe function uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the given string. It then identifies the repeated characters by filtering out those that occur only once. The function then removes all occurrences of the repeated characters from the string using a list comprehension and returns the resulting string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563450, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=238, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=401))
