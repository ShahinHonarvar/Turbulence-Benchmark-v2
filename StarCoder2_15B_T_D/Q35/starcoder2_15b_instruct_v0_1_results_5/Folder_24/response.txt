It creates a list of characters from the string between indices 13 and 91. It then iterates through the list of characters and checks if each character is unique. If the character is unique, it is added to the `unique_chars` list. Finally, the function returns the string formed by joining the characters in the `unique_chars` list.\n\nThis function removes repeated characters from a given string between indices 13 and 91.
