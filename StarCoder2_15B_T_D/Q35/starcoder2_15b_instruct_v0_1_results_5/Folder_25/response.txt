For each character, we check if it has been seen before and if it occurs more than once between indices 37 and 43. If it has, we remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of the remaining characters.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563439, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=177, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=340))
