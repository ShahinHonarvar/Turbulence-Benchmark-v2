ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Define a function called `remove_repeat_chars` that takes one argument, a string.\n2. Use a for loop to iterate over the characters in the given string.\n3. For each character, use the count method to determine how many times it occurs in the string.\n4. If the count is greater than 1 and the character is between indices 50 and 200, use the replace method to remove all occurrences of the character from the string.\n5. Return the altered string.\n\nHere\'s the Python code that solves this problem:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    for char in string:\n        if string.count(char) > 1 and 50 < string.index(char) < 200:\n            string = string.replace(char, "")\n    return string\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `remove_repeat_chars` that takes a string as an argument. It then iterates over each character in the string and checks whether it occurs more than once between indices 50 and 200, both exclusive. If so, it removes all occurrences of that character from the string using the replace method. Finally, it returns the altered string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563407, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=279, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=443))
