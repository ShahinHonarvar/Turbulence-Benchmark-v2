Write a function called `remove_repeat_chars` that takes one argument, a string.\n2. For each character that occurs more than once between the indices 36 and 52, both exclusive, remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string.\n3. Return the altered string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string: str) -> str:\n    counts = {}\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        if i >= 36 and i < 52:\n            counts[c] = counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n    for c, count in counts.items():\n        if count > 1:\n            string = string.replace(c, '')\n\n    return string\n```\n\nThis function first counts the occurrences of each character in the given string between indices 36 and 52. Then, it iterates through the characters with counts greater than one and removes them from the string. Finally, it returns the altered string.\n\nNote that this function assumes the given string is mutable, and modifies it in-place. If the string is immutable, you can create a new string and return it instead.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730563596, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=296, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=459))
