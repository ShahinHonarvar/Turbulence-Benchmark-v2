We can iterate over the characters in the given string and update the character counts in the dictionary. If a character count exceeds 1, we know that it has repeated between the given indices. We can then remove all occurrences of that character from the string using a list comprehension.\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    char_counts = {}\n    for i, char in enumerate(string):\n        if 55 < i < 84:\n            char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n\n    repeated_chars = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    return "".join(char for char in string if char not in repeated_chars)\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a dictionary to keep track of the character counts between indices 55 and 84.
