Then, it finds the indices of all characters that occur more than once between indices 57 and 85, both exclusive, and stores them in a dictionary. Next, it removes all occurrences of these characters from the string while preserving the order of all characters by iterating through the string and building a new string. Finally, it returns the altered string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560829, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=248, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=411))
