The function should remove all occurrences of a character from the string if that character occurs more than once between the indices 56 and 90, both exclusive. The function should return the altered string.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use a loop to iterate through the string and keep track of the occurrences of each character using a dictionary. If a character occurs more than once between the specified indices, we can remove all occurrences of that character from the string.\n\nHere\'s how we can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    occurrences = {}\n    for i, char in enumerate(string):\n        if char not in occurrences:\n            occurrences[char] = [i]\n        else:\n            occurrences[char].append(i)\n\n    for char, indices in occurrences.items():\n        if len(indices) > 1 and all(56 < index < 90 for index in indices):\n            string = string.replace(char, "")\n\n    return string\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each character in the string. For each character, we store the indices at which it occurs in the string.\n\nWe then iterate through each character and its corresponding indices in the dictionary. If a character occurs more than once and all its occurrences are between indices 56 and 90, we remove all occurrences of that character from the string.\n\nFinally, we return the altered string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560228, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=356, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=519))
