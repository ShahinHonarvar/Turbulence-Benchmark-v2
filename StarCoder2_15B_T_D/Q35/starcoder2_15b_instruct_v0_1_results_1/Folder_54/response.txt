ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To write a function called `remove_repeat_chars` that takes a string as an argument, we can first iterate through the string and count the occurrences of each character using a dictionary. Then, we can loop through the string again and remove any characters that occur more than once between indices 35 and 64, while preserving the order of the remaining characters.\n\nHere is the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    char_counts = {}\n    for char in string:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    result = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(string):\n        if char_counts[char] == 1 or (i < 35 or i >= 64):\n            result.append(char)\n    return "".join(result)\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The `remove_repeat_chars` function takes a string as an argument.\n- The `char_counts` dictionary is used to count the occurrences of each character in the string.\n- The `result` list is used to store the characters that will be kept in the final string.\n- The `for` loop iterates over the string and checks if each character occurs more than once between indices 35 and 64. If so, it is added to the `result` list.\n- The `join` function is used to convert the `result` list back into a string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560516, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=322, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=485))
