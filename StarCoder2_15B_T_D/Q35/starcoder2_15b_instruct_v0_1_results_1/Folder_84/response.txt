Then, it iterates over the characters in the string and updates their counts in the dictionary. Next, it iterates over the dictionary to find characters that occur more than once. For each such character, it removes all occurrences of that character from the string. Finally, it returns the modified string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560755, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=173, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=336))
