If so, we add it to the `chars` set and append it to the `result` list.\n- If the character does not occur more than once between indices 2 and 5, we simply append it to the `result` list.\n- Finally, we return the `result` list joined into a string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560191, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=257, prompt_tokens=161, total_tokens=418))
