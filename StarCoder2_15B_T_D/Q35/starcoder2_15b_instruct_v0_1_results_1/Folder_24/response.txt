To remove repeated characters from the string, we can use a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the string and check if it occurs more than once between indices 13 and 91. If it does, we filter out all occurrences of that character from the string. We then join the remaining characters to form the new string.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    """\n    Removes repeated characters from a string between indices 13 and 91.\n    """\n    repeated_chars = [c for c in string[13:91] if string[13:91].count(c) > 1]\n    new_string = "".join([c for c in string if c not in repeated_chars])\n\n    return new_string\n```\n\nThe function `remove_repeat_chars` takes a string as an argument.
