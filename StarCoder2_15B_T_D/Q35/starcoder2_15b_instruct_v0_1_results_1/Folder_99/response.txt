We can use a dictionary to store the characters and their indices, and remove any characters that have already been seen.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `remove_repeat_chars`:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    seen_chars = {}\n    result = ""\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        if c not in seen_chars:\n            seen_chars[c] = i\n            result += c\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function `remove_repeat_chars` takes a string as input and returns a new string with repeated characters removed. It uses a dictionary `seen_chars` to keep track of which characters have been seen and their indices. It iterates over the characters in the string and adds any character that has not been seen before to the result string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560871, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=208, prompt_tokens=165, total_tokens=373))
