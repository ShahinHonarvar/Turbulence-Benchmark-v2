The function iterates through the characters in the string and counts the occurrences of each character using a dictionary. If the character occurs more than once in the given range, the character is added to a set `chars_to_remove`.\n\nNext, the function iterates through the characters in the string again and removes any characters that are present in the set `chars_to_remove`. The resulting string is returned.\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    char_counts = {}\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if 36 < i < 85:\n            char_counts[c] = char_counts.get(c, 0) + 1\n\n            if char_counts[c] > 1:\n                chars_to_remove.add(c)\n\n    return "".join(c for c in s if c not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThere is no need for comments in the Python code, so they have been omitted from the code.
