ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use a combination of Python\'s built-in string methods and data structures. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. Extract the substring from the given string between indices 355 and 988, both exclusive.\n2. Create a dictionary to track the frequency of each character in the substring.\n3. Iterate through each character in the substring and check if its frequency is greater than 1.\n4. If the frequency is greater than 1, remove all occurrences of that character from the string.\n5. Return the altered string.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function that solves this problem:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string: str) -> str:\n    substring = string[355:988]\n    char_freq = {}\n    for char in substring:\n        char_freq[char] = char_freq.get(char, 0) + 1\n    for char in char_freq:\n        if char_freq[char] > 1:\n            string = string.replace(char, "")\n    return string\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560696, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=245, prompt_tokens=165, total_tokens=410))
