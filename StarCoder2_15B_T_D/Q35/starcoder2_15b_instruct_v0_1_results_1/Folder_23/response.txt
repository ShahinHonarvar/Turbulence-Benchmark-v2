Extract the relevant information from the text specification: In this case, the relevant information is the function name, argument name, and the indices of the character to be removed.\n2. Write the Python code that fulfills the specification: In this case, the Python code would be a function called `remove_repeat_chars` that takes a string as an argument. The function should remove all occurrences of a character from the string if the character occurs more than once between the indices 20 and 36.\n3. Ensure that the Python code doesn't contain any comments or unnecessary whitespace: The Python code should be as concise as possible, without any comments or unnecessary whitespace.\n4. Delimit the Python code with triple backticks: This indicates that the following code block is Python code, and it should be interpreted as such.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i, char in enumerate(string):\n        if string.count(char) > 1 and 20 < i < 36:\n            chars_to_remove.add(char)\n    for char in chars_to_remove:\n        string = string.replace(char, '')\n\n    return string\n```\n\nThe `remove_repeat_chars` function takes a string as an argument and iterates over its characters. If a character occurs more than once between the indices 20 and 36, it is added to a set of characters to be removed. After the iteration, the function removes all occurrences of the characters in the set from the string, and returns the altered string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560273, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=379, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=542))
