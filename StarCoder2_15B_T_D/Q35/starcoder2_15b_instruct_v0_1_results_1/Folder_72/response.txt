In this case, the specification is to create a function called `remove_repeat_chars` that takes a string as an argument, and for each character that occurs more than once between indices 13 and 70, remove all occurrences of that character from the string while preserving the order of the remaining characters.\n\nHere\'s how you could create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    for i in range(13, 70):\n        if s.count(s[i]) > 1:\n            s = s.replace(s[i], "")\n    return s\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560657, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=160, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=323))
