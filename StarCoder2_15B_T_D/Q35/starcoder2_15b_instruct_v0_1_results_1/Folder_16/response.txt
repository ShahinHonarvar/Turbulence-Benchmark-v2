We'll then iterate through the given string, keeping track of the indices of each character using a dictionary. For each character that occurs more than once between indices 90 and 97, we'll remove all occurrences of that character from the string. Finally, we'll return the altered string.\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    char_indices = {}\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if c not in char_indices:\n            char_indices[c] = [i]\n        else:\n            char_indices[c].append(i)\n    for c, indices in char_indices.items():\n        if len(indices) > 1 and 90 < indices[0] < 97:\n            s = s.replace(c, '')\n\n    return s\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560207, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=205, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=368))
