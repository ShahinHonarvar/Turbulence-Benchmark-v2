ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="The goal of this challenge is to create a function that removes characters that occur more than once in a given string. The function should take a string as an argument and return a modified string with repeated characters removed. The function should remove all occurrences of a character if it occurs more than once between indices 22 and 24, both exclusive. The order of characters in the string should be preserved.\n\nHere's how you could implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    unique_chars = set()\n    result = []\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(string):\n        if i >= 22 and i < 24:\n            if char not in unique_chars:\n                unique_chars.add(char)\n                result.append(char)\n        else:\n            result.append(char)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis function first iterates through the string and identifies characters that occur only once between indices 22 and 24. It uses a set to track unique characters. If a character is not in the set, it is added to the set and appended to the result list. If a character is in the set, it is skipped. After the iteration, the function joins the result list to produce a new string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730560326, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=274, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=437))
