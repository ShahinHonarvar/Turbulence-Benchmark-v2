We can then iterate through the string, checking if the frequency of the current character is greater than 1. If it is, we can remove all occurrences of the character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(text):\n    char_freq = {}\n    for char in text:\n        char_freq[char] = char_freq.get(char, 0) + 1\n    result = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char_freq[char] > 1:\n            continue\n        result.append(char)\n\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each character in the given string.

If it is, the character is skipped, otherwise it is added to the result.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730561271, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=228, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=391))
