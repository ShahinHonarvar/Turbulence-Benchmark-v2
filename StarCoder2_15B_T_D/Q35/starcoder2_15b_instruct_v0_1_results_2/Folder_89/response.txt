The function should remove any characters that occur more than once between indices 55 and 84, exclusive, while preserving the order of characters in the string.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(text):\n    chars_to_remove = {}\n    for i, char in enumerate(text):\n        if 55 < i < 84 and text.count(char) > 1:\n            chars_to_remove[char] = None\n\n    new_text = ""\n    for char in text:\n        if char not in chars_to_remove:\n            new_text += char\n\n    return new_text\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The function takes a string as an argument.\n- The function iterates through each character in the string, and checks if the character occurs more than once between indices 55 and 84, exclusive.\n- If the character occurs more than once, it is added to a dictionary of characters to remove.\n- A new string is constructed by iterating through the original string and adding each character that is not in the dictionary of characters to remove.\n- The function returns the new string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730561553, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=286, prompt_tokens=163, total_tokens=449))
