ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the provided text specification, we can deduce that we need to write a function called `all_even_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all even integers within a specific range. The range is from index 86 to index 90, both exclusive, which means the function should return the even integers in the list that are located between indices 86 and 90, not including the values at indices 86 and 90 themselves.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `all_even_ints_exclusive` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_exclusive(int_list):\n    result = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(int_list):\n        if i >= 86 and i < 90 and num % 2 == 0:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730482623, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=197, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=345))
