Understand the problem: The problem involves creating a function called 'all_even_ints_exclusive' that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all even integers in the specified range.\n2. Define the function: The function should be defined using the 'def' keyword, followed by the function name, the arguments it takes, and a colon.\n3. Define the parameters: The function should take one parameter, 'nums', which should be a list of integers.\n4. Define the logic: The logic for the function should be written inside an indented block. This is where you will define the logic for selecting the even integers from the specified range.\n5. Return the result: Once you have selected the even integers, you should return them from the function using the'return' keyword.\n6. Test the function: To test the function, you can create a list of integers and call the function with this list as an argument. You can then compare the result to the expected output.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_exclusive(nums):\n    even_ints = []\n    for i in range(1, 2):\n        if nums[i] % 2 == 0:\n            even_ints.append(nums[i])\n    return even_ints\n```\n\nThe code defines a function called 'all_even_ints_exclusive' that takes a list of integers as an argument. It then iterates over the specified range (1 to 2, both exclusive) and checks if each integer is even. If it is, it is added to the 'even_ints' list. Finally, the function returns the list of even integers.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730483366, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=395, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=541))
