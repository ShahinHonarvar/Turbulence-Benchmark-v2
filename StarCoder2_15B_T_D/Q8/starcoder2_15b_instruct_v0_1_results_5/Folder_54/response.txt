ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code according to the text specification, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Parse the text specification: The text specification indicates that we need to write a function called `all_even_ints_exclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 27 to index 34, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n2. Create Python code: To achieve this, we can create a function called `all_even_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument. We can then use a list comprehension to filter out the even integers from the list, and we can use the `slice` function to extract the even integers from index 27 to index 34. Finally, we can return the resulting list.\n3. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n4. Ensure no comments: The Python code should not contain any comments.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_exclusive(lst):\n    return [n for i, n in enumerate(lst) if i >= 27 and i < 34 and n % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers as an argument.
