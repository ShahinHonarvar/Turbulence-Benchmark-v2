ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code according to the text specification, we need to understand the requirement. The requirement states that we need to create a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns a list of all integers divisible by both -11 and -15 from index 32 to index 99, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's how we can create Python code to meet the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[32:100] if num % -11 == 0 and num % -15 == 0]\n```\n\nThe code above creates a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of integers. It then uses list comprehension to filter out the integers that are divisible by both -11 and -15 from index 32 to index 99, both inclusive.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730506334, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=255, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=419))
