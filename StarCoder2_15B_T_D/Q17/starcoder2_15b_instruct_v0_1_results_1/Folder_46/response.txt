Understand the text specification: First, you need to understand the text specification to determine the function's name, arguments, and expected behavior. In this case, the function should be called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` and take one argument, a list of integers.\n2. Decide on the function's behavior: Next, you need to determine the function's behavior based on the text specification. It should return the list of all integers divisible by both 55 and 36 from index 11 to index 46, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n3. Write the Python code: Finally, you can write the Python code to implement the function based on the specification. You can use a list comprehension to filter the integers in the given list that are divisible by both 55 and 36 and then slice the resulting list to obtain the desired range.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums if num % 55 == 0 and num % 36 == 0][11:47]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to filter the integers in the given list that are divisible by both 55 and 36, and then slices the resulting list to obtain the desired range from index 11 to index 46, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730506582, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=385, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=549))
