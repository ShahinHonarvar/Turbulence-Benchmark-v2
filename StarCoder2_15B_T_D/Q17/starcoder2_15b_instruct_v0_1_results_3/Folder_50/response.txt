Define the function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` with one argument, `ints`, which is a list of integers.\n2. Initialize an empty list to hold the integers divisible by both 67 and 15.\n3. Iterate over the elements of `ints` from index 46 to index 91, both inclusive.\n4. For each element, check if it is divisible by both 67 and 15 using the modulo operator (`%`).\n5. If the element is divisible by both 67 and 15, append it to the list.\n6. Return the list of integers divisible by both 67 and 15.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(ints):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(46, 92):\n        if ints[i] % 67 == 0 and ints[i] % 15 == 0:\n            result.append(ints[i])\n    return result\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730507984, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=316, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=480))
