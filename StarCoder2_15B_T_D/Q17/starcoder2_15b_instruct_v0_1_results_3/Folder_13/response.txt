The code should not contain any comments, and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nThe function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both 45 and 20 from index 13 to index 18, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function, assuming the list of integers is stored in a variable called `my_list`:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):\n    result = [x for x in my_list[13:19] if x % 45 == 0 and x % 20 == 0]\n    return result\n```\n\nThe code first creates a list comprehension that filters out the elements of the list that are divisible by both 45 and 20 from index 13 to index 18, both inclusive. The result is stored in the `result` variable, which is then returned by the function.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730507729, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=278, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=442))
