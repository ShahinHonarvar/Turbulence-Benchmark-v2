ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To solve this problem, we need to understand the given text specification. From the text, we can infer that we need to create a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of integers that are divisible by both 55 and 10 from index 58 to index 81, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's how we can create the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[58:82] if num % 55 == 0 and num % 10 == 0]\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use list comprehension to filter out the integers that are divisible by both 55 and 10 from index 58 to index 81, both inclusive. We check if each integer in the specified range is divisible by 55 and 10 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the integer is divisible by both 55 and 10, it is added to the resulting list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730508083, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=270, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=434))
