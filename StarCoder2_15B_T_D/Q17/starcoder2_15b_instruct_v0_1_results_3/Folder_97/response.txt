Define the function with the required parameters.\n2. Create an empty list to store the integers divisible by both 72 and 62.\n3. Loop through the given list of integers.\n4. Check if the current integer is divisible by both 72 and 62.\n5. If it is, add it to the list of divisible integers.\n6. Return the list of divisible integers.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(ints):\n    divisible_ints = []\n    for i in range(len(ints)):\n        if i >= 58 and i <= 75 and ints[i] % 72 == 0 and ints[i] % 62 == 0:\n            divisible_ints.append(ints[i])\n    return divisible_ints\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the `range` function to loop through the given list of integers. It checks if the current integer is divisible by both 72 and 62 and if its index is within the specified range. If it meets both conditions, it is added to the list of divisible integers. Finally, the list of divisible integers is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730508279, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=343, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=507))
