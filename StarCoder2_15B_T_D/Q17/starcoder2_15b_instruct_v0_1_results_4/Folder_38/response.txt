If so, it adds it to the `result` list. At the end, it returns the `result` list containing all the integers divisible by both -40 and -12 from index 10 to index 76.\n\nNote that the function assumes that the list of integers has at least 77 elements and that the indices start at 0.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730508526, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=265, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=429))
