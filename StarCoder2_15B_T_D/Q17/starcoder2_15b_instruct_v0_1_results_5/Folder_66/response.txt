This can be achieved by using a list comprehension with the `filter` function, which takes a function and a list as arguments and returns a list of elements for which the function returns True.\n\nHere's how we can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(numbers):\n    return [number for number in numbers[58:82] if number % 55 == 0 and number % 10 == 0]\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a list comprehension to filter out the elements that are divisible by both 55 and 10 from index 58 to index 81. The `number % 55 == 0 and number % 10 == 0` condition checks if the number is divisible by both 55 and 10.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730509375, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=238, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=402))
