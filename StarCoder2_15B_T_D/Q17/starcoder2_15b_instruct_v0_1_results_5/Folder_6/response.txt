The function should take one argument, a list of integers, and return a list of integers divisible by both 82 and 90 from index 41 to index 56, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code that will solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [n for n in nums[41:57] if n % 82 == 0 and n % 90 == 0]\n```\n\nThe function 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' takes one argument, a list of integers. It then uses list comprehension to filter out the integers divisible by both 82 and 90 from index 41 to index 56, both inclusive. The comprehension checks if each integer is divisible by both 82 and 90 using the modulo operator (%). The result is returned as a list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730508972, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=262, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=426))
