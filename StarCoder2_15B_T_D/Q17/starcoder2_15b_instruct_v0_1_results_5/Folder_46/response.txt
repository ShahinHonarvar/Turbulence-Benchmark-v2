The list comprehension can be used to extract the desired elements from the given list.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(ints_list):\n    return [num for i, num in enumerate(ints_list) if i >= 11 and i <= 46 and num % 55 == 0 and num % 36 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to filter the given list of integers, keeping only those that are divisible by both 55 and 36 and are located between indexes 11 and 46, both inclusive. The list comprehension iterates over the given list, keeping only those elements that satisfy the specified conditions.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730509250, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=209, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=373))
