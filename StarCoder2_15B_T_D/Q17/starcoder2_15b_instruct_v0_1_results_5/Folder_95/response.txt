ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the given text specification, we need to write a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -30 and -88 from index 57 to index 84, both inclusive.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the `filter` function in Python to filter out the integers that are divisible by both -30 and -88 from the given list. We can then use the `all` function to check if each integer is divisible by both -30 and -88. We can use the `slice` function to select the specified range of integers from the filtered list.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):\n    return [x for x in filter(lambda x: all([x % -30 == 0, x % -88 == 0]), lst)][57:85]\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function to filter out the integers that are divisible by both -30 and -88 from the given list. It then uses the `all` function to check if each integer is divisible by both -30 and -88. Finally, it uses the `slice` function to select the specified range of integers from the filtered list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730509564, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=316, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=480))
