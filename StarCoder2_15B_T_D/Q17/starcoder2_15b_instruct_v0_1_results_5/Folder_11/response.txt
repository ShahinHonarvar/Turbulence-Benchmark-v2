Since the function only needs to return integers divisible by both -85 and -30, we can use the `and` operator to check if an integer is divisible by both -85 and -30.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    """\n    Returns the list of all integers divisible by both -85 and -30 from index 22 to index 24, both inclusive.\n    If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n    """\n    result = []\n    for num in nums[22:25]:\n        if num % -85 == 0 and num % -30 == 0:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730509011, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=226, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=390))
