Parse the text specification: Understand the requirement and identify the task to be performed. In this case, the task is to write a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers divisible by both 35 and 87.\n2. Generate Python code: Translate the task into Python code by following the syntax and best practices of the Python programming language.\n3. Verify the code: Test the generated code with sample inputs to ensure it meets the requirements and produces the expected output.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code based on the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(ints):\n    return [x for x in ints[24:33] if x % 35 == 0 and x % 87 == 0]\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730509385, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=218, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=382))
