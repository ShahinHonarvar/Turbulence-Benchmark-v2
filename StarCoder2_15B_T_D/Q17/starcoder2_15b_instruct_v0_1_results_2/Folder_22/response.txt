If it is, it is added to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730507108, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=221, prompt_tokens=165, total_tokens=386))
