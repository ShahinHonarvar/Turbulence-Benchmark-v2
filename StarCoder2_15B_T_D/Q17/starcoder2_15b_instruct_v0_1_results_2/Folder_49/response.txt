The list comprehension will iterate over the elements of the given list and check if the element is divisible by both 10 and 1000 using the modulo operator (`%`). The elements that satisfy the condition will be added to the resulting list.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums`:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[80:201] if num % 10 == 0 and num % 1000 == 0]\n```\n\nThe function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of integers that are divisible by both 10 and 1000. The list comprehension iterates over the elements of the given list from index 80 to index 200 (inclusive) and checks if the element is divisible by both 10 and 1000 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the element is divisible by both 10 and 1000, it is added to the resulting list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730507299, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=305, prompt_tokens=167, total_tokens=472))
