Extract the text specification: From the given instruction, we can see that the text specification is "Write a function called \'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both 22 and 82 from index 55 to index 66, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list."\n2. Break down the text specification into individual components: The text specification can be broken down into the following components:\n   - Function name: \'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums\'\n   - Function arguments: one argument, a list of integers\n   - Function return value: the list of all integers divisible by both 22 and 82 from index 55 to index 66, both inclusive, or an empty list if no such integers exist\n   - Function implementation details:\n      - The function should take one argument, a list of integers\n      - The function should return the list of all integers divisible by both 22 and 82 from index 55 to index 66, both inclusive\n      - If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list\n3. Convert the text specification into Python code:\n   - The function name \'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums\' suggests that it should be defined as a function in Python.\n   - The function arguments \'a list of integers\' suggest that it should take one argument, which should be a list of integers.\n   - The function return value \'the list of all integers divisible by both 22 and 82 from index 55 to index 66, both inclusive\' suggests that it should return a list of integers that are divisible by both 22 and 82, and the function should be able to handle the case where no such integers exist.\n   - The function implementation details \'the list of all integers divisible by both 22 and 82 from index 55 to index 66, both inclusive\' suggest that it should iterate through the list of integers starting at index 55 and ending at index 66, and check if each integer is divisible by both 22 and 82.\n   - The function implementation details \'if no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list\' suggest that it should return an empty list if no such integers exist in the specified range.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function \'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums\' in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    result = []\n    for num in nums[5:7]:\n        if num % 22 == 0 and num % 82 == 0:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we define a function \'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums\' that takes one argument, \'nums\', which is a list of integers. The function iterates through the specified range of \'nums\' and checks if each integer is divisible by both 22 and 82. If it is, it is added to the\'result\' list. Finally, the function returns the\'result\' list, which contains the list of all integers divisible by both 22 and 82 from index 55 to index 66, both inclusive.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730507087, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=783, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=947))
