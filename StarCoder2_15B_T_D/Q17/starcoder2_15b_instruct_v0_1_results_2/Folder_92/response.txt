The 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list containing only the integers that are divisible by both 1 and -1 from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(ints):\n    return [i for i in ints if i % 1 == 0 and i % -1 == 0]\n```\n\nThe 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' function uses a list comprehension to filter out the integers that are divisible by both 1 and -1 from the given list. The modulo (%) operator is used to check if an integer is divisible by another integer. If an integer is divisible by 1, the modulo operation will result in a remainder of 0. Similarly, if an integer is divisible by -1, the modulo operation will also result in a remainder of 0. To ensure that an integer is divisible by both 1 and -1, we use the 'and' operator to combine the two modulo checks.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730507573, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=304, prompt_tokens=160, total_tokens=464))
