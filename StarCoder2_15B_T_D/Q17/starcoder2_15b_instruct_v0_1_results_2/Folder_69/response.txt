If it is, it should be added to the result list. The function should also check that the index of the integer is within the specified range of 61 to 88, both inclusive.\n\nHere's how we can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    result = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if num % 31 == 0 and num % 11 == 0 and 61 <= i <= 88:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730507423, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=216, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=380))
