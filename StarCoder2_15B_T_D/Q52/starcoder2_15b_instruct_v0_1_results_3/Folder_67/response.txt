It iterates through the string, checks if each substring of length 42 is a palindrome, and adds it to the set if it is. The function uses the built-in `set` data structure to store the palindromes and the slicing operator `[:]` to extract substrings from the given string.\n\nThe function `palindrome_of_length_n` takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length 42 as substrings of the given string.
