ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='This problem requires you to write a function called `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length 53 as substrings of the given string. To solve this problem, we need to understand the following concepts:\n\n1. Palindromes: A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "racecar" and "Madam" are palindromes.\n2. Substrings: A substring is a sequence of characters that appears in a string. For example, "car" is a substring of "racecar".\n3. Length of a string: The length of a string is the number of characters in it.\n4. Case-insensitive matching: Case-insensitive matching means that the matching should be case-insensitive, i.e., it should ignore the case of the letters. For example, "Madam" and "mAdAM" should be considered the same.\n\nTo write a function that finds palindromes of length 53 as substrings of the given string, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the string to lowercase to perform case-insensitive matching.\n2. Iterate over all substrings of length 53 in the string.\n3. Check if each substring is a palindrome.\n4. If a substring is a palindrome, add it to the result set.\n5. Return the result set.\n\nHere\'s how we can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(string):\n    string = string.lower()\n    result = set()\n    for i in range(len(string) - 52):\n        substring = string[i:i+53]\n        if substring == substring[::-1]:\n            result.add(substring)\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730636643, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=399, prompt_tokens=189, total_tokens=588))
