It converts the string to lowercase to perform a case-insensitive comparison. Then it iterates over all possible substrings of length n in the string, checks if each substring is a palindrome, and adds it to the set of palindromes if it is. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730636324, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=329, prompt_tokens=189, total_tokens=518))
