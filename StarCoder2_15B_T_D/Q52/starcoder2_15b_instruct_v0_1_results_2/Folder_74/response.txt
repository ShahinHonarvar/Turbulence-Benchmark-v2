Extract the text specification: The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets. We need to extract the text specification from the given instruction.\n2. Parse the text specification: The text specification is a string that describes the desired function, its arguments, and the expected output. We need to parse this text specification to extract the necessary information.\n3. Generate Python code: Based on the extracted information, we can generate the corresponding Python code that meets the given specification.\n4. Format the Python code: The generated Python code should be formatted according to the PEP 8 style guide. This will ensure that the code is readable and consistent with the Python coding standards.\n5. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited by triple backticks to indicate that it is a code block. This will help the reader identify the code from the rest of the instruction.\n\nHere\'s how you can create Python code according to the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(string):\n    """\n    This function takes a string as an argument and returns the set of all\n    palindromes of the length equal to 96, where each palindrome is a substring\n    of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n    If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given\n    string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the\n    palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n    """\n    string = string.lower()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(string) - 96 + 1):\n        substring = string[i:i + 96]\n        if substring == substring[::-1] and substring.isalpha():\n            palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730636100, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=407, prompt_tokens=189, total_tokens=596))
