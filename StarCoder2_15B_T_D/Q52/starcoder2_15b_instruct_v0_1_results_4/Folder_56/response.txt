ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code that meets the given specification, we need to understand the text specification. The specification states that we need to write a function called `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length 95 as substrings of the given string. The palindromes should only consist of English letters and should be found in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(string):\n    """\n    Find all palindromes of length 95 in a given string, ignoring case.\n\n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        set: A set of all palindromes of length 95 in the given string.\n    """\n    palindromes = set()\n    n = 95\n    for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):\n        substring = string[i:i+n].lower()\n        if substring == substring[::-1]:\n            palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe code defines a function called `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a string as an argument and returns a set of all palindromes of length 95 as substrings of the given string. The function iterates over all substrings of length 95 in the input string and checks if each substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. The function converts the substring and its reverse to lowercase before comparing them to ignore case. If the substring is a palindrome, it is added to the `palindromes` set.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730639104, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=372, prompt_tokens=189, total_tokens=561))
