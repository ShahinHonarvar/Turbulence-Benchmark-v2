We can use a regular expression to find all the palindromes of length 223 in the given string, and then return them as a set.\n\nHere's how we can implement this using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(text):\n    regex = re.compile(r'(?i)(\\w{223})(?=\\1)')\n    matches = regex.findall(text)\n    return set(matches)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a regular expression with the following parts:\n- `(?i)`: This is a regular expression flag that makes the match case-insensitive.\n- `(\\w{223})`: This is a capture group that matches any word character (letter, number, underscore) repeated 223 times.\n- `(?=\\1)`: This is a positive lookahead assertion that checks if the next characters match the capture group.\n\nThis regular expression matches all palindromes of length 223 in the given string, and the `findall` method returns them as a list. We then convert the list to a set to remove any duplicate palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730639121, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=297, prompt_tokens=190, total_tokens=487))
