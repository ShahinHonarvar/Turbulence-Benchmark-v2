The function should ignore case and only consider English letters when checking for palindromes.\n\nHere is the Python implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(string):\n    palindromes = set()\n    n = 48\n    for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):\n        substring = string[i:i+n]\n        if substring == substring[::-1] and substring.isalpha():\n            palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe function `palindrome_of_length_n` takes a string as input and returns a set of all palindromes of length 48 as substrings of the given string. It iterates through all substrings of length 48 in the given string, checks if each substring is a palindrome, and adds it to the set of palindromes if it is. The function considers only English letters when checking for palindromes. It ignores case by converting both the substring and its reverse to lowercase before comparing them.\n\nThe function `palindrome_of_length_n` takes a string as input and returns a set of all palindromes of length 48 as substrings of the given string.
