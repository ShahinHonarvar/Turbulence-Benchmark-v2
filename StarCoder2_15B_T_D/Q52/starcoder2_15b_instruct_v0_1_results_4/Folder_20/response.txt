Define a function called `palindrome_of_length_n`:\n   - The function should take one argument, `string`, which is a string.\n   - The function should return a set of all palindromes of length 53 that are substrings of the given string.\n   - Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n2. Find all substrings of length 53 in the given string:\n   - You can use the `len` function to get the length of the string.\n   - You can use the `range` function to generate indices for the starting position of the substrings.\n   - You can use the slice operator (`[]`) to extract the substrings.\n3. Check if each substring is a palindrome:\n   - You can reverse the substring and compare it with the original substring.\n   - You can use the `==` operator to compare the reversed substring with the original substring.\n4. If the substring is a palindrome, add it to the set of palindromes:\n   - You can use the `add` method of the set to add the palindrome to the set.\n   - You can use the `isalpha` method of the string to check if the substring only consists of English letters.\n5. Return the set of palindromes:\n   - You can use the `return` statement to return the set of palindromes.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(string):\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(string) - 52):\n        substring = string[i:i+53]\n        if substring == substring[::-1] and substring.isalpha():\n            palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function uses a `for` loop to iterate over all substrings of length 53 in the given string. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. If the substring is a palindrome and only consists of English letters, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the set of palindromes is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730638363, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=487, prompt_tokens=189, total_tokens=676))
