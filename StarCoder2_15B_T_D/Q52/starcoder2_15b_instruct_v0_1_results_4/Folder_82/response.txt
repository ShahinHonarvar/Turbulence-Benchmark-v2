ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code that meets the specified requirements, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Extract the length of the palindromes from the text specification: In the given text specification, the length of the palindromes is specified as 28. We can extract this information using regular expressions or string manipulation techniques.\n\n2. Find all substrings of the given length in the given string: We can use a sliding window approach to find all substrings of the specified length in the given string. For each substring, we will check if it is a palindrome and meet the other specified conditions.\n\n3. Check if a substring is a palindrome: To check if a substring is a palindrome, we can compare the substring with its reversed version. If the substring is equal to its reversed version, it is a palindrome.\n\n4. Check if a substring consists of only English letters: We can use a regular expression to check if the substring consists of only English letters. The regular expression can be constructed using the `re` module in Python.\n\n5. Store the palindromes in a set: We can use a set to store the palindromes we find. A set is a data structure that guarantees uniqueness of its elements. This is helpful in avoiding duplicates.\n\n6. Return the set of palindromes: After finding all the palindromes, we can return the set of palindromes as the final result.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(string):\n    length = 28\n    substrings = [string[i:i+length] for i in range(len(string)-length+1)]\n    palindromes = {substring for substring in substrings\n                    if substring == substring[::-1] and\n                    re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z]+$', substring)}\n\n    return palindromes\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730639724, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=411, prompt_tokens=189, total_tokens=600))
