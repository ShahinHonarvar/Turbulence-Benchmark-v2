Palindromes should only consist of English letters and should be found in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(string):\n    """\n    Finds the set of all palindromes of length 15 as substrings of the given string.\n    Palindromes should only consist of English letters and should be found in a\n    case-insensitive manner.\n    """\n    results = set()\n    n = len(string)\n\n    for i in range(n - 14):\n        for j in range(i + 14, n):\n            substring = string[i:j + 1]\n            if len(substring) == 15 and substring.isalpha() and substring.lower() == substring[::-1].lower():\n                results.add(substring)\n\n    return results\n```\n\nThis implementation uses nested for loops to iterate over all possible substrings of length 15 in the given string. For each substring, we check if it is a palindrome, consists of only English letters, and is equal to its reverse in a case-insensitive manner. If all of these conditions are met, we add the substring to the results set.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730637955, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=317, prompt_tokens=189, total_tokens=506))
