Extract the text specification:\n   - The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets.\n   - The text specification should not contain any comments.\n   - The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n2. Understand the text specification:\n   - Create a function called `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes one argument, a string.\n   - Return the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 37, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string.\n   - Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n   - If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set.\n   - The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n3. Write the Python code:\n   - We can define a function called `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes one argument, `string`.\n   - We can use a regular expression to find all palindromes of the length equal to 37 as substrings of the given string.\n   - We can use the `re.findall` function to find all matching palindromes.\n   - We can use the `set` function to convert the list of matching palindromes into a set.\n   - We can use the `re.IGNORECASE` flag to match palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n   - We can use the `r'(?i)([a-z]{37})'` pattern to match all palindromes of the length equal to 37, where each palindrome consists of English letters.\n   - We can return the set of all matching palindromes.\n\nHere's the Python code that follows the text specification:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(string):\n    pattern = r'(?i)([a-z]{37})'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, string)\n    return set(matches)\n```\n\nThe `palindrome_of_length_n` function takes a string as an input and returns a set of all palindromes of the length equal to 37 as substrings of the given string. The function uses a regular expression to find all matching palindromes, converts the list of matching palindromes into a set, and returns the set of all matching palindromes. The `re.IGNORECASE` flag is used to match palindromes in a case-insensitive manner. The `r'(?i)([a-z]{37})'` pattern is used to match all palindromes of the length equal to 37, where each palindrome consists of English letters.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730641329, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=595, prompt_tokens=189, total_tokens=784))
