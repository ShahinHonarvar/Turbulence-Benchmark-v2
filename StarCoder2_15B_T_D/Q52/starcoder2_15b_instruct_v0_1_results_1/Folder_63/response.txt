To find the palindromes, we need to consider the following:\n\n- The function should return a set of palindromes of length 18 as substrings of the given string.\n- Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n- The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(string):\n    palindromes = set()\n    length = len(string)\n    for i in range(length - 17):\n        for j in range(i + 18, length + 1):\n            substring = string[i:j]\n            if substring == substring[::-1] and substring.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a nested loop to iterate over all substrings of length 18 in the given string. For each substring, we check if it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version. We also check if the substring only consists of English letters. If both conditions are met, we add it to the set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730634473, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=306, prompt_tokens=189, total_tokens=495))
