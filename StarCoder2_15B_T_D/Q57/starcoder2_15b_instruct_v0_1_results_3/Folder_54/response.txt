ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code according to the text specification, we need to understand what the text specification means. The text specification states that we need to create a function called `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as an argument and returns a list of all submatrices in the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix is equal to -59. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `submatrix_with_particular_sum`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    submatrices = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(i, rows):\n                for l in range(j, cols):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if submatrix.sum() == -59:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first import the numpy library and define the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function. The function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument and returns a list of all submatrices in the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix is equal to -59.\n\nTo find these submatrices, we use nested for loops to iterate over all possible submatrices of the given matrix. For each submatrix, we calculate the sum of all integers in the submatrix using the numpy `sum` method. If the sum of the submatrix is equal to -59, we add the submatrix to the list of submatrices.\n\nFinally, we return the list of submatrices. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return an empty list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730673055, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=416, prompt_tokens=161, total_tokens=577))
