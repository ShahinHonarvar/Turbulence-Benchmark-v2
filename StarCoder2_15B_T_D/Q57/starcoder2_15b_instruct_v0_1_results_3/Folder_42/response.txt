You can use a nested loop to iterate over all possible submatrices and check if their sum is equal to 862.\n\nHere is an implementation in Python:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    m, n = matrix.shape\n    submatrices = []\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(n):\n            for k in range(i, m):\n                for l in range(j, n):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == 862:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- `matrix` is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers.\n- `m` and `n` are the number of rows and columns in `matrix`, respectively.\n- `submatrices` is a list to store all submatrices with the desired sum.\n- The nested loop iterates over all possible submatrices of `matrix`.\n- `submatrix` is a slice of `matrix` defined by the indices `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`.\n- If the sum of `submatrix` is 862, it is added to the `submatrices` list.\n- Finally, `submatrices` is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730672920, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=323, prompt_tokens=162, total_tokens=485))
