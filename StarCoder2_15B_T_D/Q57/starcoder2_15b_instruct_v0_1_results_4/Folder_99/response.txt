To create Python code that meets the specification, the following steps are taken:\n\n1. Understand the problem: Understand the problem statement and identify the required input and output types and values.\n2. Break down the problem: Break down the problem into smaller parts and identify the required functions, methods, and classes.\n3. Design the solution: Design a solution that meets the requirements, considering the input and output types and values.\n4. Implement the solution: Implement the solution using the Python programming language.\n5. Test the code: Test the code to ensure that it meets the specifications by running unit tests.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    submatrices = []\n    for i in range(len(matrix) - 2):\n        for j in range(len(matrix[0]) - 2):\n            submatrix = matrix[i:i+3, j:j+3]\n            if submatrix.sum() == -185:\n                submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input and returns a list of all submatrices of size 3x3 that have a sum of -185. The code iterates over all possible submatrices of size 3x3 and checks if their sum equals -185. If a submatrix with the desired sum is found, it is added to the list of submatrices.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730674387, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=382, prompt_tokens=162, total_tokens=544))
