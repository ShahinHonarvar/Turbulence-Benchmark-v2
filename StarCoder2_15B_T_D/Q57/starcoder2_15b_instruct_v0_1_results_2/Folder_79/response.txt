From the text specification, we can see that the function should take a two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument and return a list of all submatrices whose sum equals -47.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    submatrices = []\n    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):\n            for k in range(i, matrix.shape[0]):\n                for l in range(j, matrix.shape[1]):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == -47:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nThis function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument and returns a list of all submatrices whose sum equals -47. The function iterates through all possible submatrices of the given matrix and checks if their sum equals -47. If a submatrix with the desired sum is found, it is added to the list of submatrices.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730672299, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=275, prompt_tokens=161, total_tokens=436))
