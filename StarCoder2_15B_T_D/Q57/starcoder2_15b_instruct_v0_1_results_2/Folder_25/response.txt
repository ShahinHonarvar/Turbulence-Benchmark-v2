The `numpy` library provides a powerful array data structure that can be used to represent matrices and perform various operations on them.\n\nGiven a two-dimensional numpy matrix, we can use a nested loop to iterate over each element in the matrix. For each element, we can consider a submatrix with a fixed size (for example, 2x2) centered at that element. We can then calculate the sum of all integers in that submatrix and compare it to -20. If the sum equals -20, we can add that submatrix to the list of submatrices.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function using the `numpy` library:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    m, n = matrix.shape\n    submatrices = []\n    for i in range(m - 1):\n        for j in range(n - 1):\n            sub_matrix = matrix[i:i+2, j:j+2]\n            if sub_matrix.sum() == -20:\n                submatrices.append(sub_matrix)\n\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a nested loop to iterate over each element in the matrix.
