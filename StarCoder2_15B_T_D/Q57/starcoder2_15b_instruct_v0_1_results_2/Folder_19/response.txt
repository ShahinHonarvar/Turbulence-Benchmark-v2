The problem is to find submatrices of a given two-dimensional numpy matrix whose sum equals -97. The solution is to use a nested loop to iterate through all possible submatrices and calculate their sum. If the sum equals -97, then the submatrix is added to the result list. If no such submatrix is found, an empty list is returned.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    result = []\n    m, n = matrix.shape\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(n):\n            for k in range(i, m):\n                for l in range(j, n):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if np.sum(submatrix) == -97:\n                        result.append(submatrix)\n    return result\n```\n\nThe code uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible submatrices of the given matrix. The `i` and `j` variables represent the top-left corner of the submatrix, while the `k` and `l` variables represent the bottom-right corner. The sum of the submatrix is calculated using the `np.sum()` function from numpy. If the sum equals -97, the submatrix is added to the result list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730671734, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=323, prompt_tokens=161, total_tokens=484))
