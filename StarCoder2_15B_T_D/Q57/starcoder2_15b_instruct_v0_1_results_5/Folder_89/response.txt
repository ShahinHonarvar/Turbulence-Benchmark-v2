ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code based on the text specification, we need to understand the problem statement and the desired output. The problem statement indicates that we need to write a function called `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes a two-dimensional Numpy matrix of integers as an argument. The function should return a list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 80. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `submatrix_with_particular_sum`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    submatrices = []\n    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):\n            for k in range(i, matrix.shape[0]):\n                for l in range(j, matrix.shape[1]):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if submatrix.sum() == 80:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nThe function `submatrix_with_particular_sum` takes a two-dimensional Numpy matrix as an argument. It iterates over each submatrix of the given matrix and checks if the sum of all integers in the submatrix equals 80. If a submatrix with the desired sum is found, it is added to the list of submatrices. The function returns the list of submatrices.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730675266, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=340, prompt_tokens=161, total_tokens=501))
