ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='The instruction asks you to write a function called `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as an argument. The function should return a list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix is 77. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.\n\nTo accomplish this, you can use a nested loop to iterate through all possible submatrices of the given matrix, and check if the sum of the integers in each submatrix is 77. If it is, add the submatrix to the list of submatrices.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `submatrix_with_particular_sum`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    submatrices = []\n    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):\n            for k in range(i, matrix.shape[0]):\n                for l in range(j, matrix.shape[1]):\n                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if submatrix.sum() == 77:\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n    return submatrices\n```\n\nThe function `submatrix_with_particular_sum` takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument. It iterates through all possible submatrices of the given matrix using nested loops, and checks if the sum of the integers in each submatrix is 77. If it is, the submatrix is added to the list of submatrices. The function returns the list of submatrices that have a sum of 77.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730670826, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=375, prompt_tokens=161, total_tokens=536))
