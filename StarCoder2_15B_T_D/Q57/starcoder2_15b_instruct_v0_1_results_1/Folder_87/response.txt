If we find a submatrix with a sum of 35, we'll add it to the result list.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    result = []\n    n, m = matrix.shape\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            for k in range(i, n):\n                for l in range(j, m):\n                    sub_matrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]\n                    if sub_matrix.sum() == 35:\n                        result.append(sub_matrix)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function iterates over all possible submatrices of the given matrix and checks if their sum is equal to 35. If a submatrix with the desired sum is found, it's added to the result list.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes the given matrix is a two-dimensional numpy array. If it's not, you can modify the code to handle other types of two-dimensional matrices.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730671427, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=267, prompt_tokens=161, total_tokens=428))
