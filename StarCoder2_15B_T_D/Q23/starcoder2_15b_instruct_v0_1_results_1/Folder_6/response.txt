Define a function called `find_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument.\n2. Create an empty list to store the divisors.\n3. Iterate through the range of integers between 58 and 90, both inclusive.\n4. Check if the current integer is a divisor of the given number by checking if the remainder of the given number divided by the current integer is zero.\n5. If the current integer is a divisor, add it to the list of divisors.\n6. Return the list of divisors at the end of the function.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(number):\n    divisors = []\n\n    for i in range(58, 91):\n        if number % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis implementation defines a function called `find_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument. It then iterates through the range of integers between 58 and 90, both inclusive, and checks if each integer is a divisor of the given number. If it is, it adds it to the list of divisors. Finally, it returns the list of divisors at the end of the function.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730524437, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=325, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=482))
