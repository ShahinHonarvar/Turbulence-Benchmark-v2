If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this function:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    """Finds all positive divisors of \'num\' that are between 59 and 88, both inclusive."""\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, num + 1):\n        if num % i == 0 and 59 <= i <= 88:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThe function `find_divisors_in_range` takes a positive integer as an argument and returns a list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 59 and 88, both inclusive. It uses a simple `for` loop to iterate over all possible divisors of the given integer and checks if they are between 59 and 88, both inclusive. If a divisor is in the specified range, it is added to the `divisors` list. Finally, the function returns the list of divisors.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730524828, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=299, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=456))
