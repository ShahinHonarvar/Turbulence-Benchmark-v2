If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    return [i for i in range(3, 8) if n % i == 0]\n```\n\nThe `find_divisors_in_range` function takes a positive integer `n` as its argument and returns a list of positive divisors of `n` that are between 3 and 7, both inclusive. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the range from 3 to 8 and check if each number is a divisor of `n` using the modulo operator (`%`). If the modulo is 0, the number is a divisor and is added to the list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730524654, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=235, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=390))
