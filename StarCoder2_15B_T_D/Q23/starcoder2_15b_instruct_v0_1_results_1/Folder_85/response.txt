This function should find all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 2 and 5, both inclusive, and return them in a list. If no such divisors exist, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(2, 6):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the range from 2 to 5, and checks if the given number is divisible by the current number using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, the current number is a divisor of the given number, and it is added to the `divisors` list. The function returns the list of divisors.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730524977, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=236, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=391))
