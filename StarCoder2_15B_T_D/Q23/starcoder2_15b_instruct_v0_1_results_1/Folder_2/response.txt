If no such divisors exist, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `find_divisors_in_range` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 315 <= i <= 955:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis function takes a positive integer `n` as its argument and returns a list of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 315 and 955, both inclusive. It iterates from 1 to `n + 1` and checks if each number is a divisor of `n` using the modulo operator (`%`). If a number is a divisor of `n` and is also between 315 and 955, it is added to the `divisors` list. Finally, the `divisors` list is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730524406, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=302, prompt_tokens=159, total_tokens=461))
