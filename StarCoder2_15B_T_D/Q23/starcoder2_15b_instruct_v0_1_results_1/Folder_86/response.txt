Define a function named `find_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument.\n2. Create an empty list to store the divisors.\n3. Iterate through the range of numbers from 372 to 494, inclusive.\n4. Check if the given number is divisible by the current number in the range.\n5. If it is divisible, append the current number to the list of divisors.\n6. After the loop, return the list of divisors.\n\nHere's how you could implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(372, 495):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis function takes a positive integer as its argument, and iterates through the range of numbers from 372 to 494, inclusive. For each number in the range, it checks if the given number is divisible by the current number. If it is divisible, the current number is appended to the list of divisors. Finally, the function returns the list of divisors.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730524991, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=305, prompt_tokens=159, total_tokens=464))
