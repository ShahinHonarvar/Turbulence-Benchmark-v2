From the given text specification, we can see that we need to create a function called `find_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument and returns a list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 7 and 8, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `find_divisors_in_range` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and 7 <= i <= 8:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we iterate through all possible divisors of the given integer `n` using a `for` loop. For each divisor `i`, we check if `n` is divisible by `i` and if `i` is between 7 and 8, both inclusive. If both conditions are met, we add `i` to the `divisors` list. Finally, we return the `divisors` list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730527190, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=294, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=449))
