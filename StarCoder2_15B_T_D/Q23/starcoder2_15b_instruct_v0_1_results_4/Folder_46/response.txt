It then iterates through the range of integers from 81 to 88, and checks if the given number is divisible by each integer in the range. If it is divisible, it adds the divisor to a list of divisors. Finally, it returns the list of divisors.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730526781, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=213, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=370))
