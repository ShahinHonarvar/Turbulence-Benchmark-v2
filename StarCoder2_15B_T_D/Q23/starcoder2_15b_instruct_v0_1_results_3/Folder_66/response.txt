Identify the function name, `find_divisors_in_range`, and its argument, `num`.\n2. Determine the task of the function, which is to find all positive divisors of `num` in the range of 32 to 35, both inclusive.\n3. Create a list to store the divisors, and iterate over the possible divisors from 32 to 35.\n4. Check if each possible divisor is a positive divisor of `num`, and add it to the list if so.\n5. Return the list of divisors at the end.\n6. Enclose the code in triple backticks to indicate that it is a code block.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(32, 36):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the possible divisors from 32 to 35, and checks if each possible divisor is a positive divisor of the given number. If it is, it is added to the list of divisors. Finally, the list of divisors is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730526225, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=308, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=465))
