If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the implementation of `find_divisors_in_range` using Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, num + 1):\n        if num % i == 0 and 5 <= i <= 7:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThe function `find_divisors_in_range` takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 5 and 7, both inclusive. The function iterates through all possible divisors of the given integer and checks if they are between 5 and 7, both inclusive. If a divisor is in the specified range, it is added to the list of divisors. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730526353, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=285, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=440))
