Take a positive integer as its argument.\n2. Find all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 4 and 9, both inclusive.\n3. Return the list of such divisors.\n4. Return an empty list if no such divisors exist in the specified range.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement the function `find_divisors_in_range` in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    """Find all positive divisors of n that are between 4 and 9, both inclusive."""\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            if 4 <= i <= 9:\n                divisors.append(i)\n            if 4 <= n // i <= 9:\n                divisors.append(n // i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThe function `find_divisors_in_range` takes a positive integer `n` as its argument. It iterates through all positive integers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive), checking if each integer is a divisor of `n`. If a divisor is found, it checks if it is between 4 and 9, both inclusive. If so, it is added to the list of divisors. If the quotient of `n` by the current divisor is also between 4 and 9, it is also added to the list of divisors. Finally, the function returns the list of divisors.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730526132, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=370, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=525))
