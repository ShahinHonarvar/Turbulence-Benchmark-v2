It does this by iterating through all possible divisors from 1 to the given number, and checking if each divisor divides the given number evenly. If it does, and the divisor is between 315 and 955, it is added to the list of divisors. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730525792, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=282, prompt_tokens=159, total_tokens=441))
