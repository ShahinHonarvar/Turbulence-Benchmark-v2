If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `find_divisors_in_range` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0 and i >= 2 and i <= 4:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThe function `find_divisors_in_range` takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 2 and 4, both inclusive. It iterates through all possible divisors of the given integer between 2 and the integer itself, checks if the divisor is in the range of 2 to 4, and adds it to the list of divisors if it is.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730526051, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=273, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=428))
