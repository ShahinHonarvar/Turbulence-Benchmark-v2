Define a function called `find_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument.\n2. Iterate from 5 to 8, both inclusive, and check if each number is a divisor of the given integer.\n3. If a number is a divisor, add it to a list of divisors.\n4. After the iteration, return the list of divisors.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(5, 9):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis implementation defines a function `find_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument.
