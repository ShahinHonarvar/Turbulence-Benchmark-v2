Define a function called `find_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument.\n2. Initialize an empty list to store the divisors.\n3. Iterate through all the integers between 28 and 81, including both 28 and 81.\n4. For each integer, check if it is a divisor of the given integer.\n5. If it is a divisor, add it to the list of divisors.\n6. Return the list of divisors.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `find_divisors_in_range` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(28, 82):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis function iterates through all the integers between 28 and 81, and checks if each integer is a divisor of the given integer. If it is a divisor, it is added to the list of divisors. Finally, the list of divisors is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730525232, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=296, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=453))
