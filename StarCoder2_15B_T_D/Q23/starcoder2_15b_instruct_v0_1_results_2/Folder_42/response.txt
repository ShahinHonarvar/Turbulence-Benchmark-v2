ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='The problem statement asks you to write a function called `find_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument and returns a list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 14 and 93, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `find_divisors_in_range` function using list comprehension in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(n):\n    return [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if n % i == 0 and 14 <= i <= 93]\n```\n\nThis function takes a positive integer `n` as its argument. It returns a list of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 14 and 93, both inclusive. The list comprehension iterates through all integers `i` between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` (using the modulo operator `%`) and is also between 14 and 93.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730525364, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=256, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=413))
