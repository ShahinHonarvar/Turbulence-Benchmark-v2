ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Based on the given specification, we can write a function called `find_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument. The function should find all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 81 and 88, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function according to the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(81, 89):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis function finds all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 81 and 88, both inclusive. It iterates through the range of integers from 81 to 88, and checks if each integer divides the given number evenly. If it does, the integer is added to the list of divisors. Finally, the function returns the list of divisors.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730525386, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=245, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=402))
