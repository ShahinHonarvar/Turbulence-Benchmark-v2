Create an empty list to store the divisors.\n2. Iterate over all possible divisors of the given integer, which are all integers between 1 and the given integer, inclusive.\n3. Check if each divisor is between 48 and 62, both inclusive.\n4. If a divisor is in the specified range, append it to the list of divisors.\n5. Return the list of divisors at the end of the function.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(number):\n    divisors = []\n    for divisor in range(1, number + 1):\n        if 48 <= divisor <= 62 and number % divisor == 0:\n            divisors.append(divisor)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThis function starts by creating an empty list to store the divisors. It then iterates over all possible divisors of the given integer, which are all integers between 1 and the given integer, inclusive. For each divisor, it checks if it is between 48 and 62, both inclusive, and divides the given integer evenly. If a divisor is in the specified range, it is appended to the list of divisors. Finally, the function returns the list of divisors at the end.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730525132, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=356, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=513))
