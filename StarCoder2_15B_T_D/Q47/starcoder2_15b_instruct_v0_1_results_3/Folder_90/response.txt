The function should take a string as an argument.\n2. The function should extract the substring from index 106 to 280, both inclusive, from the given string.\n3. The function should identify all palindromes in the extracted substring that have lengths between 136 and 151, both inclusive.\n4. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters, and the function should find them in a case-insensitive manner.\n5. The function should return a set of all the identified palindromes.\n6. If no palindrome with the specified length occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere's how you could implement such a function using Python:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(text):\n    substring = text[106:281]\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(136, 152):\n        for i in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            window = substring[i:i + length]\n            if window.lower() == window[::-1].lower():\n                palindromes.add(window)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the substring from index 106 to 280, both inclusive, from the given string. It then iterates over all possible window lengths (between 136 and 151, both inclusive) and checks if any palindromes of that length exist in the substring. Each palindrome is checked for case-insensitivity and added to the set of identified palindromes. Finally, the set of identified palindromes is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730606015, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=389, prompt_tokens=236, total_tokens=625))
