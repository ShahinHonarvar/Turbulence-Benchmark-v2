To check if a substring is a palindrome, we can compare it with its reverse. To consider only palindromes consisting of English letters, we can use the `isalpha()` method to check if each character is an English letter.\n\nHere is the Python code to implement the function `palindromes_of_specific_lengths`:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = string[16:95]\n    for length in range(39, 53):\n        for i in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            substring_to_check = substring[i:i+length]\n            if substring_to_check.lower() == substring_to_check[::-1].lower():\n                if all(c.isalpha() for c in substring_to_check):\n                    palindromes.add(substring_to_check)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe function `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` takes a string as input and returns a set of palindromes that satisfy the specified conditions. It iterates over all substrings of length between 39 to 52 in the specified index range. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. It also checks if the substring consists of only English letters. If all the conditions are met, the substring is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730605662, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=479, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=711))
