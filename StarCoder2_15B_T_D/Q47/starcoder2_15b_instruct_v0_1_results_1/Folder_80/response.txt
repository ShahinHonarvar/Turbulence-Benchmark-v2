ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="Based on the instruction, we need to write a function called `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` that takes a string as input and returns a set of palindromes that meet specific requirements. The function should only consider palindromes of lengths between 24 and 33 (both inclusive), occurring in the substring from index 35 to index 88, both inclusive. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters and should be found in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):\n    substring = string[35:89]\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(24, 34):\n        for i in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            window = substring[i:i+length]\n            if window.lower() == window[::-1].lower():\n                palindromes.add(window)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first extract the substring from index 35 to index 88. Then, we iterate over all possible palindrome lengths between 24 and 33 (inclusive) and for each length, we iterate over all possible starting indices for the palindrome in the substring. For each starting index and length, we extract the corresponding window from the substring and check if it is a palindrome. If it is, we add it to the `palindromes` set. Finally, we return the set of palindromes that meet the specified criteria.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730604010, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=340, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=572))
