We can extract the substring from index 1 to index 9, iterate over all possible palindrome lengths between 3 and 7, and check for each length if a palindrome exists in the substring. We can use a regular expression to match only English letters and a case-insensitive match.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(text):\n    """\n    Finds all palindromes of specific lengths in a given string.\n    """\n    substring = text[1:10]\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(3, 8):\n        pattern = re.compile(r"(?i)(\\w{%d})(?:\\W+(?P=1))+" % length)\n        matches = pattern.findall(substring)\n        palindromes.update(matches)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use a regular expression to match palindromes of specific lengths within the substring. The regular expression uses a backreference to ensure that the palindrome consists of the same characters on both sides. The `(?i)` flag ensures that the match is case-insensitive.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730603766, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=444, prompt_tokens=228, total_tokens=672))
