ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use Python\'s string slicing and regular expression matching capabilities. First, we can extract the substring from index 24 to index 84, both inclusive, from the given string. Then, we can use a regular expression to match palindromes of specific lengths in the extracted substring. We can use a regular expression to match only palindromes of lengths between 21 and 31 (both inclusive) that consist of only English letters. Finally, we can find all the matching palindromes using the `re.findall()` function.\n\nHere\'s a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string: str) -> set:\n    """\n    Finds all palindromes in a substring of the given string with specific lengths.\n    Only palindromes of lengths between 21 and 31 (both inclusive) should be considered.\n    Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. The function should\n    find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n    """\n    substring = string[24:85]\n    pattern = re.compile(r"([a-zA-Z]{21,31})(?=\\1)", re.IGNORECASE)\n    return set(re.findall(pattern, substring))\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the substring from index 24 to index 84, both inclusive, from the given string. Then, it uses a regular expression to match palindromes of specific lengths in the extracted substring. The regular expression `r"([a-zA-Z]{21,31})(?=\\1)"` matches palindromes of lengths between 21 and 31 (both inclusive) that consist of only English letters. The `re.IGNORECASE` flag is used to make the matching case-insensitive. Finally, the `re.findall()` function is used to find all the matching palindromes in the substring. The `set()` function is used to remove any duplicate palindromes.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730603399, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=445, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=677))
