A regular expression pattern is created to match palindromes of the required length. The pattern matches any sequence of ten to thirty-five characters that are letters. The `findall` method is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the substring. The matches are checked for palindromes by comparing them with their own reverse. If the match is a palindrome, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the set of palindromes is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730603700, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=226, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=458))
