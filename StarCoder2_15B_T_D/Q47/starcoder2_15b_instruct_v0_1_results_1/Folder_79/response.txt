The function should find all palindromes of lengths between 3 and 4 in the substring of the given string from index 1 to 8 (inclusive), ignoring case.\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = string[1:9]\n    for i in range(len(substring) - 3):\n        for j in range(i + 3, i + 5):\n            window = substring[i:j]\n            if window.lower() == window[::-1].lower():\n                palindromes.add(window)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The function takes a string as an argument.\n- The substring from index 1 to 8 is extracted from the given string.\n- A sliding window of length 3 to 4 is used to iterate over the substring.\n- Each window is checked if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.\n- The case of the window is ignored by converting it to lowercase before comparison.\n- If the window is a palindrome, it is added to the set of palindromes.\n- Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730603995, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=324, prompt_tokens=228, total_tokens=552))
