Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Extract the substring from index 26 to index 84, both inclusive, using `string[26:85]`.\n2. Define a function called `is_palindrome` that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome.\n3. Define a function called `is_length_valid` that takes a string as input and checks if its length is between 30 and 46.\n4. Define a function called `is_alphabetic` that takes a string as input and checks if it consists of English letters only.\n5. Iterate through all the substrings of the extracted string, checking if they satisfy the conditions defined in steps 2, 3, and 4.\n6. Add the palindromes that satisfy the conditions to a set called `palindromes`.\n7. Return the set of palindromes, `palindromes`.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):\n    substring = string[26:85]\n    def is_palindrome(string):\n        return string == string[::-1]\n    def is_length_valid(string):\n        return len(string) >= 30 and len(string) <= 46\n    def is_alphabetic(string):\n        return string.isalpha()\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(substring)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(substring)):\n            substring = string[i:j]\n            if is_palindrome(substring) and is_length_valid(substring) and is_alphabetic(substring):\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function uses a nested for loop to iterate through all the substrings of the extracted string. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome, has a length between 30 and 46, and consists of English letters only. If a substring satisfies all the conditions, it is added to a set called `palindromes`. Finally, the set of palindromes is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730603378, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=510, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=742))
