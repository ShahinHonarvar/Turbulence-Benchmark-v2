The function `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` should take a string as input, find all palindromes in the specified index range, with lengths between 35 and 41, consisting of only English letters, and return them in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `palindromes_of_specific_lengths`:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(text):\n    """\n    Returns a set of all palindromes in the given text that meet the following\n    requirements:\n    1. Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 32 to index 79, both inclusive, should be considered.\n    2. Only palindromes of lengths between 35 to 41 (both inclusive) should be considered.\n    3. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n    4. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n    """\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = text[32:80]\n    for i in range(len(substring) - 35):\n        for j in range(35, 42):\n            window = substring[i:i+j]\n            if window == window[::-1] and window.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(window)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe implementation follows the given instructions. We first extract the substring from index 32 to index 79, then iterate through all possible substrings of lengths between 35 and 41, and check if they are palindromes and consist of only English letters. If so, we add them to the `palindromes` set. Finally, we return the set of palindromes.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730603876, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=401, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=633))
