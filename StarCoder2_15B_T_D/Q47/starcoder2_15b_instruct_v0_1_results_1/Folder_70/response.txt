In this case, the function `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` takes a string as an argument and returns a set of palindromes that meet certain conditions. The function should only consider palindromes in a specified index range (10 to 70) and of specific lengths (between 24 and 52). Each palindrome should only consist of English letters and should be found in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere\'s how you can create the Python code based on the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):\n    """\n    Find all palindromes of specific lengths in a given string.\n    Only considers palindromes in the substring from index 10 to 70, both inclusive.\n    Only considers palindromes of lengths between 24 to 52, both inclusive.\n    Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n    If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, returns an empty set.\n    """\n    result = set()\n    substring = string[10:71]  # Extract substring from index 10 to 70, both inclusive\n    for length in range(24, 53):  # Iterate over all possible palindrome lengths (24 to 52)\n        for i in range(len(substring) - length + 1):  # Iterate over all possible starting indices\n            palindrome = substring[i:i+length]  # Extract palindrome of current length\n            if palindrome == palindrome[::-1] and palindrome.isalpha():  # Check if palindrome and consists of only English letters\n                result.add(palindrome)  # Add palindrome to result set\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730603925, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=406, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=638))
