Extract the information from the text specification: In this case, we are given a string and we need to find palindromes in a specific range and with specific lengths.\n2. Extract the substring from index 27 to index 95: We can use string slicing to extract the substring from the given string.\n3. Find palindromes of lengths between 49 to 51: We can iterate over all substrings of the extracted substring with lengths between 49 and 51.\n4. Check if the substring is a palindrome: We can check if the substring is the same when read from left to right or right to left.\n5. Consider only palindromes consisting of English letters: We can check if each character of the substring is an English letter using the `isalpha()` method.\n6. Find palindromes in a case-insensitive manner: We can convert the substring to lowercase using the `lower()` method before checking for palindromes.\n7. Return the set of all palindromes found: We can use a set to store the unique palindromes found and return it at the end of the function.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function 'palindromes_of_specific_lengths' in Python:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):\n    substring = string[27:96]\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(49, 52):\n        for i in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            substring_to_check = substring[i:i+length]\n            if substring_to_check.lower() == substring_to_check[::-1].lower():\n                if all(char.isalpha() for char in substring_to_check):\n                    palindromes.add(substring_to_check)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use string slicing to extract the substring from index 27 to index 95. We iterate over all possible substrings of lengths 49, 50, and 51. For each substring, we check if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. We also check if the substring consists of only English letters and add it to the set of palindromes if it satisfies all conditions. Finally, we return the set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730606141, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=534, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=766))
