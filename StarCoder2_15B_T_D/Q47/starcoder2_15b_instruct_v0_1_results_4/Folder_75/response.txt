We can use the `re` module to perform regular expression operations in Python.\n\nHere is the Python code that creates the function `palindromes_of_specific_lengths`:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):\n    regex = r"[a-zA-Z]{" + str(23) + "," + str(39) + "}"\n    palindromes = set()\n    for match in re.findall(regex, string[31:75]):\n        if match.lower() == match[::-1].lower():\n            palindromes.add(match)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThe function `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` takes a string as an argument and returns a set of palindromes that meet the specified criteria. The regular expression `regex` matches palindromes of lengths between 23 and 39 (inclusive) and only consists of English letters. The `re.findall` function is used to find all matches of the regular expression in the substring of the given string from index 31 to 74 (inclusive).\n\nFor each match, the function checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version (case-insensitive). If the match is a palindrome, it is added to the set `palindromes`. Finally, the set `palindromes` is returned as the result of the function.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730606878, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=346, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=578))
