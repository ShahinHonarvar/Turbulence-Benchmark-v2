Extract the substring from index 0 to index 100, both inclusive, from the given string.\n2. Create a set to store the palindromes of specific lengths.\n3. Iterate through all the substrings of length 3 to 15 in the extracted substring.\n4. For each substring, check if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version.\n5. If the substring is a palindrome, check if it only consists of English letters.\n6. If all the checks pass, add the palindrome to the set.\n7. Return the set of palindromes.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):\n    substring = string[0:101]\n    palindromes = set()\n\n    for length in range(3, 16):\n        for i in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            substring = substring[i:i+length]\n            if substring == substring[::-1] and substring.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis implementation extracts the substring from index 0 to index 100, both inclusive, from the given string. It then iterates through all the substrings of length 3 to 15 in the extracted substring. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. If the substring is a palindrome and only consists of English letters, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730606725, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=396, prompt_tokens=231, total_tokens=627))
