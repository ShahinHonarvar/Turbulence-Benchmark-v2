The pattern `(?) looks for a substring that matches the regular expression (?) inside the string. The regular expression `(?) looks for a substring that consists of any number of characters (?) that are followed by the same characters in reverse order (?). The regular expression `(?:[^A-Za-z]*)(?) looks for a substring that consists of any number of characters (?) that are not letters (?) followed by the same characters in reverse order (?) followed by any number of characters (?) that are not letters (?). The regular expression `[A-Za-z]*(?)` looks for a substring that consists of any number of letters (?) followed by the same characters in reverse order (?). The regular expression `(?:[^A-Za-z]*)(?)[A-Za-z]*(?)(?:[^A-Za-z]*)` looks for a substring that consists of any number of characters (?) that are not letters (?) followed by a substring that consists of any number of letters (?) followed by the same characters in reverse order (?) followed by any number of characters (?) that are not letters (?).
