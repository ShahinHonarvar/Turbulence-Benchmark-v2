Extract the instructions from the text specification: First, we need to extract the instructions from the text specification. In this case, the instructions are "palindromes occurring in the substring from index 65 to index 99, both inclusive, should be considered. Only palindromes of lengths between 26 to 33 (both inclusive) should be considered. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner."\n\n2. Create a function: We need to create a function called `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` that takes one argument, a string.\n\n3. Find palindromes: We need to find palindromes in the given string that satisfy the specified requirements. Palindromes are strings that read the same backward as forward.\n\n4. Consider the specified index range: The specified index range is from 65 to 99, both inclusive. We need to ensure that the palindromes we find are within this range.\n\n5. Consider the specified length range: The specified length range is from 26 to 33, both inclusive. We need to ensure that the palindromes we find are within this range.\n\n6. Only consider English letters: We need to ensure that the palindromes we find only consist of English letters.\n\n7. Return an empty set if no such palindrome occurs: If no such palindrome occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set.\n\n8. Find palindromes in a case-insensitive manner: The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\n9. Return the set of palindromes: The function should return the set of palindromes that satisfy the specified requirements.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `palindromes_of_specific_lengths`:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string: str) -> set:\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(65, 100):\n        for j in range(i + 26, min(i + 34, len(string))):\n            substring = string[i:j]\n            if substring.lower() == substring[::-1].lower():\n                palindromes.add(substring)\n    return palindromes\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730607820, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=550, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=782))
