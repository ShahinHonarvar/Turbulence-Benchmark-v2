ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code that solves the given problem, we need to understand the problem specification. The problem specification states that we need to write a function called `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` that takes one argument, a string. The function should return the set of all palindromes with the following requirements:\n\n1. Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 23 to index 77, both inclusive, should be considered.\n2. Only palindromes of lengths between 13 to 40 (both inclusive) should be considered.\n3. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.\n4. If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set.\n5. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nWith this understanding, we can start writing the Python code to solve the problem.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):\n    substring = string[23:78]\n    pattern = re.compile(r"[a-zA-Z]{13,40}")\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(13, 41):\n        for start in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            candidate = substring[start:start + length]\n            if candidate == candidate[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(candidate)\n\n    return palindromes\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730607957, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=336, prompt_tokens=232, total_tokens=568))
