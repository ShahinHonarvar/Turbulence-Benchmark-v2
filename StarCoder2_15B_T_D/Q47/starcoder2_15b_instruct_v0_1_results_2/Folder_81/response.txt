We can then use a loop to iterate over all possible palindrome lengths between 12 and 220. For each length, we can use a nested loop to search for all palindromes of that length in the substring. To ensure that each palindrome only consists of English letters, we can use the `isalpha()` method to check if each character is an English letter.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    substring = s[12:123]\n    palindromes = set()\n    for length in range(12, 221):\n        for i in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            palindrome = substring[i:i+length]\n            if palindrome == palindrome[::-1] and all(c.isalpha() for c in palindrome):\n                palindromes.add(palindrome)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis code extracts the substring from index 12 to 122, then iterates over all possible palindrome lengths between 12 and 220. For each length, it searches for all palindromes of that length in the substring. If a palindrome is found, it checks if it only consists of English letters using the `isalpha()` method. If it does, it adds it to the set of palindromes. At the end, it returns the set of palindromes.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730604962, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=355, prompt_tokens=234, total_tokens=589))
