For each character, it checks if the character\'s ASCII value is between 51 and 77, both inclusive, and if the character is between \'V\' and \'Y\', both inclusive. If the character meets these conditions, it is added to the `filtered` string. At the end, the function returns the filtered string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730569991, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=275, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=453))
