The function iterates through each character of the input string and checks if it is between indices 477 and 984, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \',\' and smaller than or equal to character \'V\'. If the character satisfies the conditions, it is skipped and not added to the filtered string. Otherwise, it is added to the filtered string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730569859, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=208, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=386))
