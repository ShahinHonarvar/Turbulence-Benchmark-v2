Here's how you can reason about the given text specification:\n\n1. Create a function called `filter_chars` that takes one argument, a string.\n2. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 25 and 97, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character'm' and smaller than or equal to character 'w', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string.\n3. The function should return the altered string.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function `filter_chars` in Python:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string: str) -> str:\n    filtered_chars = []\n    for char in string:\n        if (char >='m' and char <= 'w') or (char < 'a' or char > 'z'):\n            filtered_chars.append(char)\n    return ''.join(filtered_chars)\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730569968, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=231, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=409))
