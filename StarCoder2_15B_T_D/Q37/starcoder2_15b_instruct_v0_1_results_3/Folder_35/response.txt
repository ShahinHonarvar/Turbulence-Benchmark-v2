If the character satisfies these conditions, it is appended to a list of filtered characters. Finally, the filtered characters are joined together and returned as a string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730568744, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=193, prompt_tokens=177, total_tokens=370))
