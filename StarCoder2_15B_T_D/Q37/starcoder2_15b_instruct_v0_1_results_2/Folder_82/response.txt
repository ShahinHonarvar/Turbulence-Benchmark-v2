Then, we can use the re.sub() function to replace these matched characters with an empty string, effectively removing them from the string.\n\nHere is the implementation of the \'filter_chars\' function using Python\'s regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef filter_chars(text: str) -> str:\n    pattern = r"[P-x]"\n    return re.sub(pattern, "", text[12:26])\n```\n\nThe regular expression pattern, `[P-x]`, matches any character that is between \'P\' and \'x\', inclusive. The re.sub() function replaces all occurrences of this pattern with an empty string, effectively removing them from the string.
