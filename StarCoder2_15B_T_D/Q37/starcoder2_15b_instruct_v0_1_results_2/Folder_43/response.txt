If the character is not within the specified range, it is added to the `filtered` string. The function returns the filtered string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730568229, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=166, prompt_tokens=177, total_tokens=343))
