The function should return the altered string.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function `filter_chars` according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    return "".join([c for i, c in enumerate(s) if not (513 <= i <= 877 and "?" <= c <= "n")])\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730568254, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=153, prompt_tokens=179, total_tokens=332))
