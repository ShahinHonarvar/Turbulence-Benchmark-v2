If both conditions are met, the character is added to the list of filtered characters. Finally, the function returns the filtered string by joining the characters in the list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730568040, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=211, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=389))
