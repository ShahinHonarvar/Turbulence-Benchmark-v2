The specified set of characters is defined as all characters between indices 11 and 32, both inclusive, and greater than or equal to character '!' and smaller than or equal to character '@'.\n\nThe following Python code implements the function `filter_chars`:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(text: str) -> str:\n    filtered_chars = [\n        char for char in text\n        if char < '!' or char > '@' or text.index(char) < 11 or text.index(char) > 32\n    ]\n    return ''.join(filtered_chars)\n```\n\nThe function `filter_chars` takes a string as input and returns a new string with the specified characters removed. It achieves this by using a list comprehension to filter out the unwanted characters based on their index and value. The filtered characters are then joined together to form the output string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730568483, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=230, prompt_tokens=176, total_tokens=406))
