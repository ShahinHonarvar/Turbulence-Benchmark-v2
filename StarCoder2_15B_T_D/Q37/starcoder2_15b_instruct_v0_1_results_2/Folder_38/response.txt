Otherwise, the character is added to the filtered string. Finally, the filtered string is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730568198, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=173, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=351))
