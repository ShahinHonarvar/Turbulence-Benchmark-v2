For each character, it checks whether its ASCII value is between 19 and 32, inclusive. If it is, the character is added to the `filtered_chars` list. Otherwise, it is removed from the string. Finally, the function returns the filtered string, which contains only the characters that were not removed.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730567790, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=173, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=351))
