It uses slicing to get a substring containing the characters to be removed. It then uses a list comprehension to filter out the unwanted characters from the original string. Finally, it uses the join method to reassemble the filtered characters into a new string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730567352, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=209, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=387))
