Within the function, you can iterate over the characters of the string using a for loop, and check if each character is between indices 35 and 40, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to `')'` and smaller than or equal to `'l'`. If the character meets these conditions, you can remove all occurrences of that character from the string using the `replace` method. Finally, you can return the altered string.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    for char in string:\n        if 35 <= ord(char) - ord(')') <= 6 and ')' <= char <= 'l':\n            string = string.replace(char, '')\n    return string\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `filter_chars` that takes one argument, a string.
