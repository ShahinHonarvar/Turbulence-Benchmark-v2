We can use a list comprehension to filter out the unwanted characters from the string and return the resulting string.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `filter_chars` in Python:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    filtered_chars = [char for i, char in enumerate(string) if not (20 <= i <= 62 and 'i' <= char <= 'k')]\n    return ''.join(filtered_chars)\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730567449, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=178, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=356))
