If the character meets both conditions, it is not added to the `filtered_chars` list. Otherwise, it is added to the list. Finally, the `filtered_chars` list is joined into a string and returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730569539, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=242, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=420))
