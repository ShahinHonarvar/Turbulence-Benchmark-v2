Extract the text specification by removing the angle brackets and any surrounding whitespace.\n2. Tokenize the text specification into individual words.\n3. Parse the text specification to extract the function name, argument name, and character range.\n4. Generate the Python code for the function using the extracted information.\n5. Create a Python code block using triple backticks.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the \'filter_chars\' function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    """\n    Filter characters between indices 13 and 28, inclusive, that are between \'c\' and \'n\', exclusive.\n    """\n    filtered_chars = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if (13 <= i <= 28) and (ord(\'c\') <= ord(c) < ord(\'n\')):\n            continue\n        filtered_chars.append(c)\n    return \'\'.join(filtered_chars)\n```\n\nThe Python code for the \'filter_chars\' function is generated by extracting the text specification from the angle brackets, tokenizing it into individual words, and parsing it to extract the function name, argument name, and character range. The function is then implemented using Python\'s string manipulation capabilities, and the code is delimited by triple backticks to create a Python code block.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730569243, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=300, prompt_tokens=178, total_tokens=478))
