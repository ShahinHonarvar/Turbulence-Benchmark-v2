If both conditions are satisfied, the character is removed from the string. Otherwise, the character is kept in the string. Finally, the filtered string is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730569690, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=202, prompt_tokens=180, total_tokens=382))
