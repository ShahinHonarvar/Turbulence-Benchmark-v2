If the character meets these conditions, it is appended to the `filtered_chars` list. The `filtered_chars` list is then joined together to form the filtered string, which is returned by the function.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730569579, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=175, prompt_tokens=180, total_tokens=355))
