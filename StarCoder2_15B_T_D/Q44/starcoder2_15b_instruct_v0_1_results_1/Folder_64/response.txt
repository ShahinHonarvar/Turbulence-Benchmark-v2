A composite number is a positive integer that is greater than 1 and is divisible by at least one number other than itself or 1.\n\nThe function uses a nested loop to check each number for divisibility. The inner loop iterates over all possible divisors, starting from 2, and checks if the current number is divisible by any of them. If it is, the number is marked as composite and added to the set of composite numbers.\n\nThe function returns the set of composite numbers between index 0 and index 4, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, an empty set is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730590876, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=290, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=445))
