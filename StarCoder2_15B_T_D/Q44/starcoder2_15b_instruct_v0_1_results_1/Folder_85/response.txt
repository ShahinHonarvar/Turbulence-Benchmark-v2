The function iterates through the list of integers and checks if each number is a composite number. It does this by iterating from 2 to the current number and checking if it has any divisors. If it does, it is a composite number and is added to the set 'composite_nums'. Finally, the function returns the set of composite numbers.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730591068, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=227, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=382))
