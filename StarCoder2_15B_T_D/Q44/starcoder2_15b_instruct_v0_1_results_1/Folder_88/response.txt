Define a function called `composite_nums_between_indices` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument.\n2. Create an empty set to store the composite numbers.\n3. Loop through the given list of integers.\n4. For each integer, check if it is composite by checking if it is greater than 1 and has a divisor other than itself.\n5. If the integer is composite and is between indices 8 and 9, add it to the set of composite numbers.\n6. Return the set of composite numbers.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if num > 1 and any(num % j == 0 for j in range(2, num)):\n            if 8 <= i <= 9:\n                composite_nums.add(num)\n    return composite_nums\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730591098, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=268, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=423))
