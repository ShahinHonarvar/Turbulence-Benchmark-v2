Define a function called `composite_nums_between_indices` that takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of positive integers.\n2. Create an empty set to store the composite numbers, `composite_nums`.\n3. Iterate over the range of indices from 0 to 2 (inclusive), using the `range` function.\n4. For each index, check if the corresponding number in `nums` is a composite number. To do this, you can use a `for` loop to iterate over the range from 2 to the square root of the number (rounded up), and check if the number is divisible by any integer in that range.\n5. If the number is divisible by any integer in the range, it is a composite number, so add it to the `composite_nums` set.\n6. Return the `composite_nums` set at the end of the function.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, 3):\n        num = nums[i]\n        for j in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):\n            if num % j == 0:\n                composite_nums.add(num)\n                break\n\n    return composite_nums\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730590696, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=331, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=486))
