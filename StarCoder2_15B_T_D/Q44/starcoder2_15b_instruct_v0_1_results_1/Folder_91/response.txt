We can use a nested for loop to check if the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If it is divisible, we can break the inner loop and continue to the next number. If we reach the end of the inner loop without finding any divisors, we can add the number to the result set.\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    result = set()\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if 5 <= i <= 5:\n            for j in range(2, num):\n                if num % j == 0:\n                    result.add(num)\n                    break\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `composite_nums_between_indices` function takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns a set of composite numbers in the specified range. It checks if each number in the list is composite by dividing it by all numbers between 2 and itself. If it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number. The function iterates over the list using a for loop and checks if the index of the current number is between 5 and 5. If it is, it checks if the number is composite using another for loop. If it is composite, it adds it to the result set. Finally, the function returns the result set.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730591133, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=312, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=467))
