A number is considered composite if it is greater than 1 and has at least one divisor other than itself or 1. The function uses a nested loop to check if each number is a composite number. The inner loop iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any number in that range. If it is divisible by any number, then the number is not a prime number and is added to the set of composite numbers.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730592427, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=245, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=402))
