A composite number is a positive integer that is greater than 1 and has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(lst):\n    return {num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if 4 <= i <= 4 and num > 1 and not all(num % d for d in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1))}\n```\n\nThe function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns a set of composite numbers between indices 4 and 4, both inclusive. The set comprehension iterates over the list, checking for each number if it is greater than 1 and has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. If so, it is added to the set.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730592130, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=209, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=364))
