We can use the range function to specify the indices between 28 and 40, both inclusive. We can use a set to store the composite numbers and return it at the end of the function.\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i in range(28, 41):\n        num = nums[i]\n        is_composite = False\n        for j in range(2, num):\n            if num % j == 0:\n                is_composite = True\n                break\n        if is_composite:\n            composite_nums.add(num)\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nThis implementation iterates over the given list of positive integers and checks if each number is composite by checking whether it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. It uses a for loop to iterate over the range of indices between 28 and 40, both inclusive, and checks if the number at that index is composite. If it is composite, it adds it to the set of composite numbers. At the end, it returns the set of composite numbers.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730592611, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=284, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=441))
