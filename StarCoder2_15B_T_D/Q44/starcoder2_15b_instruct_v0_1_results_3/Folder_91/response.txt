It checks if each number is greater than 1 and not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. The `range` function is used to generate the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. The `all` function is used to check if the number is divisible by any number in the range. The `lambda` function is used to define an anonymous function that takes a number as an argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the number is composite. The `set` function is used to return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 5 and 5, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty set.\n\nThe `lambda` function is used to define an anonymous function that takes a number as an argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the number is composite.
