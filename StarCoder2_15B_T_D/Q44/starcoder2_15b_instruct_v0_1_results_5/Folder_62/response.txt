We do this by iterating over the list and checking each number for divisibility by all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. If a number is divisible by any number other than 1 or itself, then it is composite. We store these composite numbers in a set called `composite_nums`.\n\nThen, we find the composite numbers between indices 30 and 87. We do this by iterating over the list again and checking the index of each number. If the index is between 30 and 87, we add the number to the `composite_nums` set if it is not already present.\n\nFinally, we return the `composite_nums` set, which contains all the composite numbers between indices 30 and 87.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730594228, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=325, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=482))
