We can check if a number is composite by dividing it by all numbers between 2 and the square root of the number. If any divisor results in a whole number, the number is composite. We can use a set to store the composite numbers and return it at the end of the function.\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for num in nums[64:67]:\n        is_composite = False\n        for divisor in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if num % divisor == 0:\n                is_composite = True\n                break\n        if is_composite:\n            composite_nums.add(num)\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a for loop to iterate over the specified range of indices in the given list. For each number in the range, it checks if it is composite by dividing it by all numbers between 2 and the square root of the number. If any divisor results in a whole number, the number is composite, and it is added to the set of composite numbers. At the end of the function, the set of composite numbers is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730594068, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=280, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=437))
