This function should return a set of composite numbers between indices 75 and 85, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the specification:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if i >= 75 and i <= 85:\n            for divisor in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n                if num % divisor == 0:\n                    composite_nums.add(num)\n                    break\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nIn the code, the function `composite_nums_between_indices` takes a list of positive integers as an argument. It iterates through the list and checks if each number is a composite number. A number is considered composite if it is greater than 1 and has more than two factors. The function uses a nested loop to check if each number is a composite number. The outer loop iterates through the list of numbers, and the inner loop iterates through the possible divisors of the current number. If a number is divisible by any divisor other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number and is added to the `composite_nums` set. If no composite number is found in the specified range, the function returns an empty set.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730594364, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=343, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=500))
