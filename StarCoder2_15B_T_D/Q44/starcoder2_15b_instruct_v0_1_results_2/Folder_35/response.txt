Write a function called `composite_nums_between_indices` that takes a list of integers as an argument.\n2. Find the composite numbers in the list between indices 28 and 32, both inclusive.\n3. Return the set of composite numbers as the function's output.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if i >= 28 and i <= 32:\n            is_composite = False\n\n            for j in range(2, num):\n                if num % j == 0:\n                    is_composite = True\n                    break\n\n            if is_composite:\n                composite_nums.add(num)\n\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the list of numbers and checks each number's index. If the index is between 28 and 32, it checks if the number is composite by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to the number itself. If it's divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it's composite. The function returns the set of composite numbers between the specified indices.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730591489, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=282, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=439))
