A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()  # Create an empty set to store composite numbers\n\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if i >= 74 and i <= 95:  # Check if the index is between 74 and 95\n            is_composite = False\n            for j in range(2, num):\n                if num % j == 0:  # Check if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and itself - 1\n                    is_composite = True\n                    break\n            if is_composite:\n                composite_nums.add(num)  # Add the number to the set if it is composite\n\n    return composite_nums\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730591381, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=241, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=398))
