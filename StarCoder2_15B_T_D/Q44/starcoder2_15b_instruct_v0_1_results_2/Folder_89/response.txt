If a composite number is found, it is added to a set. The function should return the set of composite numbers between indices 36 and 46, both inclusive.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if i >= 36 and i <= 46:\n            if num > 1:\n                for j in range(2, num):\n                    if num % j == 0:\n                        composite_nums.add(num)\n                        break\n\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the given list of numbers and checks if each number is a composite number.
