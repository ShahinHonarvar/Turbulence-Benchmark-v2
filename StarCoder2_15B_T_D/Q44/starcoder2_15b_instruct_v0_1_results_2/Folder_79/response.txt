ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, you can use a function called `composite_nums_between_indices` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument. Inside the function, you can use a `for` loop to iterate over the given list. For each integer, you can check if it is composite by checking if it is divisible by any number other than itself or 1. If it is composite, you can add it to a set of composite numbers. At the end of the `for` loop, you can return the set of composite numbers.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composite_nums = set()\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if i >= 6 and i <= 6:\n            for divisor in range(2, num):\n                if num % divisor == 0:\n                    composite_nums.add(num)\n                    break\n    return composite_nums\n```\n\nThis Python code solves the problem by using a function called `composite_nums_between_indices` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument.
