It then checks if the number is composite by checking if it is greater than 1 and has a divisor in the range of 2 to one less than the number itself. If both conditions are met, the number is added to the set.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730591734, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=167, prompt_tokens=157, total_tokens=324))
