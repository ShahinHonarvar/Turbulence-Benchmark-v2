The `all` function is used to check if a number is composite by checking if it is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730593328, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=290, prompt_tokens=159, total_tokens=449))
