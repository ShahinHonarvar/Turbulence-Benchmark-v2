If the element is positive, it should be added to a new list `pos_ints`.\n\nOnce the iteration is complete, the function should return `pos_ints`, which will contain all the positive integers from the specified range.\n\nHere is the implementation of `all_pos_ints_inclusive`:\n\n```python\ndef all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    pos_ints = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(lst):\n        if num > 0 and 8 <= i <= 9:\n            pos_ints.append(num)\n    return pos_ints\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730467589, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=205, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=351))
