Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-26, 442, 12, 448, -31, -440, 513, -275, 130, 335, -240, -88, 531, 91, 281, -105, 341, 454, -217, -266, 401, -26, 5, 450, -209, 53, 252, 438, -264, 121, 202, -73, 312, 283]


The correct answer was:

[121, 202, 312]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
