ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code according to the given text specification, we can use the following steps:\n1. Extract the text specification: The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets. We can use a regular expression to extract the text specification.\n2. Parse the text specification: The text specification is a description of a function called \'all_pos_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 10 to index 66, both inclusive. We can use a parser to parse the text specification into a structured format, such as a dictionary, to make it easier to work with.\n3. Generate the Python code: We can use a template engine to generate the Python code based on the parsed text specification. The template engine can be customized to generate the desired Python code based on the structured text specification.\n4. Format the Python code: The generated Python code may not be formatted in the same way as the original code. We can use a code formatter to format the generated Python code to ensure it follows the same style as the original code.\n5. Delimit the Python code: The generated Python code should be delimited by triple backticks to indicate that it is Python code. We can use a regular expression to replace the original code with the triple backtick delimiters and the formatted Python code.\n\nHere is an example of how you can create Python code according to the given text specification:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport textwrap\ntext_specification = re.search(r\'<(.*)>\', instruction).group(1)\ntemplate = """\\\ndef all_pos_ints_inclusive(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers[10:67] if num > 0]\n"""\nformatted_code = textwrap.dedent(template)\ninstruction = re.sub(r\'```.*```\', f\'```python\\n{formatted_code}\\n```\', instruction)\nprint(instruction)\n```\n\nThis code extracts the text specification from the instruction, creates a template for the Python code, formats the template, and replaces the original code with the generated Python code. The resulting instruction contains the generated Python code delimited by triple backticks.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730468205, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=472, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=620))
