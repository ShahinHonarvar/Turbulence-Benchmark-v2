The list slicing syntax is of the form `list[start:stop:step]`, where `start` is the index of the first element to include in the slice, `stop` is the index of the first element to exclude from the slice, and `step` is the step size used to select elements from the list.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the given problem:\n\n```python\ndef all_pos_ints_inclusive(list_of_ints):\n    return [x for x in list_of_ints[59:98] if x > 0]\n```\n\nThe code uses list comprehension to filter out the positive integers from the list. The list slicing syntax is used to extract the elements from index 59 to 97, both inclusive.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730468320, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=197, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=345))
