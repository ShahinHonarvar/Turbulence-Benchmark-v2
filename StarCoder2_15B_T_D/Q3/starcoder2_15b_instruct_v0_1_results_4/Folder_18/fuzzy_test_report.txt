Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[283, 454, -31, -282, 401, 531, 184, 12, 341, 281, 357, 5, 202, -240, -275, 53, -73, -112, -105, 514, -266, -288, 91, -8, -340, -88, -26, 121, 74, -549, 448, 450, 333, -440, -58, 513, -193, 404, 130, -535, 438, 407, -26, 442, 241, -209, -217, -264, 335, 252, 312]


The correct answer was:

[513, 404, 130, 438, 407, 442, 241, 335, 252]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
