Understand the specification: Read the specification carefully to understand what the function should do. In this case, the function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order, and it should return the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum of certain integers that are not present in the specified range.\n2. Break down the specification: Break down the specification into smaller parts to simplify the problem. In this case, you can first identify the integers that are not present in the specified range, and then calculate the sum of those integers.\n3. Implement the solution: Write the Python code to implement the solution according to the specification. In this case, you can use a for loop to iterate through the integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive), and check if each integer is present in the tuple using the in operator. If the integer is not present, add it to the sum. Once you have the sum, you can use the bin() and hex() functions to convert it to binary and hexadecimal representations, respectively.\n4. Generate the final code: Generate the final code by removing any comments and delimiting it with triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function according to the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup[69]\n    b = tup[97]\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum += i\n    if sum % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the specification by first identifying the integers that are not present in the specified range, and then calculating the sum of those integers. The sum is then converted to binary or hexadecimal representation depending on its oddness or evenness. The function returns an empty string if all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609046, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=453, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=760))
