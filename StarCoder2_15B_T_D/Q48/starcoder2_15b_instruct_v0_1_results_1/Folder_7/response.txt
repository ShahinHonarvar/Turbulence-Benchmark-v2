Define the function: The function should take one argument, `tup`, which is a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n2. Extract the values of \'a\' and \'b\': From the given text specification, we know that \'a\' is the integer stored at index 10, and \'b\' is the integer stored at index 97. We can retrieve these values by indexing into the tuple using `tup[10]` and `tup[97]`, respectively.\n3. Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 97: We can use a for loop to iterate over the range `range(a + 1, b)` and check if each value is present in the tuple using the `in` operator. If the value is not present in the tuple, we add it to the sum.\n4. Return the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum: If the sum is an odd number, we return the binary representation. Otherwise, we return the hexadecimal representation. We use the `bin()` and `hex()` functions to convert the sum to binary and hexadecimal, respectively. To remove the \'0b\' and \'0x\' prefixes, we use the `replace()` method to replace those prefixes with an empty string.\n5. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string: We can check if all integers in the specified range are present in the tuple by using a for loop to iterate over the range `range(a + 1, b)` and checking if each value is present in the tuple using the `in` operator. If any value is not present in the tuple, we break the loop. If we reach the end of the loop without breaking, it means that all values in the specified range are present in the tuple. In this case, we return an empty string.\n\nHere\'s how you could implement the function `return_binary_or_hexa`:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup: tuple) -> str:\n    a = tup[10]\n    b = tup[97]\n\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers).replace("0b", "")\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers).replace("0x", "")\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730608286, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=621, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=928))
