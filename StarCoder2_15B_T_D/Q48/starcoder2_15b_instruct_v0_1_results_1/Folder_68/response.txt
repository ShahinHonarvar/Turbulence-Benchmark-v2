ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To implement this function, we first need to understand the requirement. From the instruction, we can see that the function `return_binary_or_hexa` takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers as input and returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of a specific sum. The sum is calculated from the integers between a + 1 and b - 1 (inclusive), where a is the first integer and b is the last integer in the given tuple. If the sum is odd, the function returns the binary representation, otherwise it returns the hexadecimal representation. The binary and hexadecimal representations should be in the most significant digit format and should not have leading zeros.\n\nHere is the Python implementation of the function `return_binary_or_hexa`:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup: tuple) -> str:\n    a = tup[0]\n    b = tup[-1]\n    sum_val = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum_val += i\n    if sum_val % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_val)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_val)[2:].upper()\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730608940, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=262, prompt_tokens=303, total_tokens=565))
