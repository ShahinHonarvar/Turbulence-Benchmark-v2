Let's follow these steps to complete the function:\n1. Find the integers `a` and `b` from the tuple.\n2. Calculate the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 3 and 9.\n3. If the sum is an odd number, convert the sum to its binary representation string and return it.\n4. Otherwise, convert the sum to its hexadecimal representation string and return it.\n5. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, return an empty string.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `return_binary_or_hexa`:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup: tuple) -> str:\n    a = tup[3]\n    b = tup[9]\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup[3:10]:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609246, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=332, prompt_tokens=303, total_tokens=635))
