ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To generate the Python code from the given text specification, we need to follow the following steps:\n\n1. Extract the function name and argument from the given text:\n   - The function name is\'return_binary_or_hexa\'.\n   - The argument is a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n2. Extract the variable names, \'a\' and \'b\', from the given text:\n   - \'a\' denotes the integer stored at index 450.\n   - \'b\' denotes the integer stored at index 905.\n3. Extract the calculation logic from the given text:\n   - The function should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 450 and 905.\n   - If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n   - The binary representation should not be prefixed with \'0b\'.\n   - The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with \'0x\'.\n   - The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n   - The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n4. Extract the edge case from the given text:\n   - If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.\n5. Generate the Python code using the extracted information:\n   - The Python code should not contain any comments.\n   - The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere is the code that implements the logic described in the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup: tuple) -> str:\n    a = tup[450]\n    b = tup[905]\n\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 0:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:].rstrip("L")\n    else:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609075, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=507, prompt_tokens=311, total_tokens=818))
