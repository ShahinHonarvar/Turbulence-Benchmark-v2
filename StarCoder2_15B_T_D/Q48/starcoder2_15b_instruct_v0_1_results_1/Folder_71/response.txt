Extract the information from the text specification.\n2. Determine the logic of the function based on the extracted information.\n3. Write the Python code without comments.\n4. Delimit the Python code with triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function'return_binary_or_hexa' in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(input_tuple):\n    a = input_tuple[20]\n    b = input_tuple[35]\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in input_tuple[20:36]:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nThis function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as input. The function extracts the integers at indices 20 and 35 and stores them in variables a and b, respectively. It then calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 20 and 35. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum. The binary representation is calculated by converting the sum to a binary string using the built-in bin() function and removing the prefix '0b'. Similarly, the hexadecimal representation is calculated by converting the sum to a hexadecimal string using the built-in hex() function and removing the prefix '0x'. The letters in the hexadecimal representation are converted to uppercase using the upper() method. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730608993, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=449, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=756))
