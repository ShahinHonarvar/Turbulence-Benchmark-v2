It first identifies the integers at indices 51 and 76, and then calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 51 and 76. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations are converted to strings using the built-in functions bin() and hex(), respectively. The prefixes '0b' and '0x' are removed from the strings using string slicing. The letters in the hexadecimal representation are converted to uppercase using the upper() method.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730608912, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=322, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=629))
