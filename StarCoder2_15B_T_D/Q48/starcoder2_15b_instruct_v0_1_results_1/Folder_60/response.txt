Identify the key points of the specification:\n   - The function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n   - Let \'a\' denote the integer stored at index 38, and \'b\' the integer stored at index 52.\n   - The function should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 38 and 52.\n   - If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n   - The binary representation should not be prefixed with \'0b\'.\n   - The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with \'0x\'.\n   - The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n   - The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n   - If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.\n2. Create Python code according to the specification:\n   - The function should take one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n   - The function should let \'a\' denote the integer stored at index 38, and \'b\' the integer stored at index 52.\n   - The function should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 38 and 52.\n   - The function should check if the sum is an odd number, and return the binary representation string of the sum if it is odd.\n   - The function should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum if the sum is even.\n   - The function should return an empty string if all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple.\n   - The function should return the binary representation string of the sum without the \'0b\' prefix.\n   - The function should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum without the \'0x\' prefix.\n   - The function should return the binary and hexadecimal representations with the most significant digit first and no leading zeros.\n   - The function should return the hexadecimal representation with lowercase or uppercase letters.\n3. Delimit the Python code with triple backticks:\n   - The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n4. Ensure that the Python code does not contain any comments:\n   - The Python code should not contain any comments.\n\nHere\'s a possible implementation of such a function:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(nums: tuple) -> str:\n    a = nums[38]\n    b = nums[52]\n    sum_of_missing = sum(range(a + 1, b)) - sum(nums[a + 1:b])\n    if sum_of_missing % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_missing)[2:]\n    elif sum_of_missing == 0:\n        return ""\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_missing)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nThis function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as an argument. It identifies the integers stored at indices 38 and 52 and calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 38 and 52. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum without the \'0b\' prefix. If the sum is even, the function returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum without the \'0x\' prefix. The hexadecimal representation can be in lowercase or uppercase letters. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730608854, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=891, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=1198))
