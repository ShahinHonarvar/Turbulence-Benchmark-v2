Extract the relevant information from the text specification:\n   - The function's name is `return_binary_or_hexa`.\n   - The function takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n   - The integer stored at index 20 is denoted by `a`.\n   - The integer stored at index 93 is denoted by `b`.\n   - The function should calculate the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 20 and 93.\n   - If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n   - The binary representation should not be prefixed with `0b`.\n   - The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with `0x`.\n   - The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n   - The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n   - If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.\n2. Write the function in Python code:\n   - The function should take one argument, `tup`, which is a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n   - The function should use the indices 20 and 93 to access the elements `a` and `b`, respectively.\n   - The function should calculate the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 20 and 93.\n   - If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n   - The binary representation should not be prefixed with `0b`.\n   - The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with `0x`.\n   - The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n   - The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n   - If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup: tuple) -> str:\n    a = tup[20]\n    b = tup[93]\n    sum_of_integers = sum(i for i in range(a + 1, b) if i not in tup)\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:].upper()\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730608258, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=666, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=973))
