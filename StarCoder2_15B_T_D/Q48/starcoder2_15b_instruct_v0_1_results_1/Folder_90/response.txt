The function, `return_binary_or_hexa`, takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. The function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n2. Let 'a' denote the integer stored at index 60, and 'b' the integer stored at index 90.\n3. The function calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 60 and 90.\n4. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n5. The binary representation should not be prefixed with '0b'.\n6. The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with '0x'.\n7. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n8. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n9. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.\n\nHere's how we can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers):\n    a = numbers[60]\n    b = numbers[90]\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in numbers:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:].lower()\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first extract the integers at indices 60 and 90 from the tuple. Then, we iterate through the range from a + 1 to b - 1, and for each integer, we check if it is present in the tuple. If it is not present, we add it to the sum of integers. Finally, we check if the sum is odd or even, and return the binary or hexadecimal representation accordingly. Note that we use the lower() method to convert the hexadecimal representation to lowercase letters.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609285, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=533, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=840))
