ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code according to the text specification, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Extract the text specification: The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets. We can use a regular expression to extract the text specification from the instruction.\n2. Break down the text specification: The text specification is a series of instructions, each of which starts with a capital letter and ends with a period. We can use a regular expression to extract these instructions.\n3. Create Python code for each instruction: For each extracted instruction, we can create the corresponding Python code. This involves understanding the instruction and translating it into Python code.\n4. Combine the Python code: The Python code for each instruction can be combined to form the final Python code.\n5. Remove comments: The Python code should not contain any comments. We can use a regular expression to remove all comments from the Python code.\n6. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. We can use a regular expression to replace the triple backticks with triple double quotes.\n\nHere is the Python code that follows the given text specification:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers: tuple) -> str:\n    a = numbers[200]\n    b = numbers[202]\n    expected_range = set(range(a + 1, b))\n    actual_range = set(numbers[a + 1:b])\n    missing_numbers = expected_range - actual_range\n    sum_of_missing_numbers = sum(missing_numbers)\n    if sum_of_missing_numbers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_missing_numbers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_missing_numbers)[2:]\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730608759, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=388, prompt_tokens=311, total_tokens=699))
