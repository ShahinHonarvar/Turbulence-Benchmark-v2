ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To implement this function, you can follow these steps:\n1. Extract the specified integers from the tuple: Extract the integers at indices 73 and 84 from the tuple. These integers will be used as the bounds for the calculation.\n2. Calculate the sum of integers not present in the specified range: Iterate through the tuple and calculate the sum of integers that are not present in the specified range. You can use a Boolean array to keep track of which integers have been seen.\n3. Determine the binary or hexadecimal representation: If the sum is an odd number, convert it to binary; otherwise, convert it to hexadecimal. Use the format specifiers to get the desired representation.\n4. Return the binary or hexadecimal representation: Return the binary or hexadecimal representation based on the parity of the sum.\n\nHere\'s a potential implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers):\n    a = numbers[73]\n    b = numbers[84]\n    seen = [False] * (b + 1)\n    for num in numbers:\n        if a <= num <= b:\n            seen[num] = True\n    sum_not_present = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if not seen[i]:\n            sum_not_present += i\n    if sum_not_present % 2 == 1:\n        return f"{sum_not_present:b}"\n    else:\n        return f"{sum_not_present:x}"\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730608377, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=324, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=631))
