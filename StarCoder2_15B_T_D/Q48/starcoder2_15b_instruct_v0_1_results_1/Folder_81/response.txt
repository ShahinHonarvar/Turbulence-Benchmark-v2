ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, you need to follow the instructions carefully. First, you need to create a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. Let\'s assume the tuple is named `tup`. Next, you need to find the integer at index 10 and store it in a variable named `a`. Similarly, you need to find the integer at index 100 and store it in a variable named `b`.\n\nAfter that, you need to calculate the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 100. To do this, you can use a loop or a built-in function to iterate over the integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` and check if each integer is present in the tuple.\n\nIf the sum is an odd number, you need to convert it to its binary representation string. To do this, you can use the built-in function `bin` and remove the prefix `\'0b\'` from the resulting string.\n\nIf the sum is an even number, you need to convert it to its hexadecimal representation string. To do this, you can use the built-in function `hex` and remove the prefix `\'0x\'` from the resulting string.\n\nFinally, if all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, you need to return an empty string.\n\nHere\'s how you can create the function `return_binary_or_hexa` in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup[10]\n    b = tup[100]\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum += i\n    if sum % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum)[2:]\n    elif sum % 2 == 0:\n        return hex(sum)[2:]\n    else:\n        return ""\n```\n\nThe function `return_binary_or_hexa` takes a tuple `tup` as an argument and returns a string. It finds the integers at indices 10 and 100 and stores them in variables `a` and `b`, respectively. It then calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 100. If the sum is an odd number, it converts it to its binary representation string and returns it. If the sum is an even number, it converts it to its hexadecimal representation string and returns it. Otherwise, if all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, it returns an empty string.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609169, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=653, prompt_tokens=309, total_tokens=962))
