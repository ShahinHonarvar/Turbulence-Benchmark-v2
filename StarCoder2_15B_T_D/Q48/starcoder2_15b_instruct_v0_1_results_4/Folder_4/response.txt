The function needs to calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 49 and 74. If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation of the sum. The binary representation should not be prefixed with '0b'. The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with '0x'. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers):\n    a = numbers[49]\n    b = numbers[74]\n    missing_numbers = set(range(a + 1, b)) - set(numbers[49:75])\n    sum_missing_numbers = sum(missing_numbers)\n    if sum_missing_numbers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_missing_numbers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_missing_numbers)[2:].upper()\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730611843, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=310, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=617))
