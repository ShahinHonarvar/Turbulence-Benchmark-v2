In this case, the text specification is provided as a Python string, so we can use string processing techniques to extract the information.\n\nFirst, we need to extract the function name, which is'return_binary_or_hexa'. Then, we need to extract the parameter name, which is 'a'. Next, we need to extract the indices 36 and 54. Finally, we need to extract the condition and the calculation logic.\n\nOnce we have extracted the necessary information, we can construct the Python code that meets the requirements.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(a):\n    a = sorted(a)\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(a[36] + 1, a[54]):\n        if i not in a:\n            sum += i\n    if sum % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first sort the tuple to ensure that the index 36 and 54 are valid. Then, we iterate through the integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) and check if they are present in the tuple. If they are not present, we add them to the sum. Finally, we check if the sum is an odd number and return the appropriate representation.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730611939, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=334, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=641))
