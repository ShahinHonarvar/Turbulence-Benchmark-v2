Here's how you can reason about the given specification:\n\n1. The function should be called `return_binary_or_hexa`.\n2. The function should take one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n3. The function should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 86 and 89.\n4. If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum.\n5. Otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n6. The binary representation should not be prefixed with `0b`.\n7. The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with `0x`.\n8. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n9. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n10. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers):\n    a = numbers[86]\n    b = numbers[89]\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a+1, b):\n        if i not in numbers:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:].upper()\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730612153, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=396, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=703))
