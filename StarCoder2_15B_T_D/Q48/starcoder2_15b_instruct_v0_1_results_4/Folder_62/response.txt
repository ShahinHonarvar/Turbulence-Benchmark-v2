Extract the 50th and 92nd indices from the tuple.\n2. Identify the range of integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple.\n3. Calculate the sum of these integers.\n4. Determine if the sum is odd or even.\n5. Convert the sum to its binary or hexadecimal representation, depending on the parity of the sum.\n6. Return the binary or hexadecimal representation as a string, depending on the parity of the sum.\n\nHere's how you could implement a Python function that solves this problem:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup[50]\n    b = tup[92]\n    missing_ints = set(range(a + 1, b)) - set(tup[a + 1:b])\n    sum_missing_ints = sum(missing_ints)\n    if sum_missing_ints % 2 == 0:\n        return hex(sum_missing_ints)[2:]\n    else:\n        return bin(sum_missing_ints)[2:]\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730612578, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=331, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=638))
