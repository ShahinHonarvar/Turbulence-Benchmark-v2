ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code according to the given text specification, we need to write a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. Let\'s follow the steps provided in the specification:\n\n1. Identify the integers `a` and `b`: The integer `a` is the one stored at index 2, and `b` is the one stored at index 8.\n2. Calculate the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 2 and 8: We need to iterate through the tuple and check for each integer between `a + 1` and `b - 1` whether it is present in the tuple. If it is not present, we add it to the sum.\n3. Determine the output based on the sum: If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n4. Format the binary and hexadecimal representations: The binary representation should not be prefixed with `0b`, and the hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with `0x`. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n5. Handle the case when all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple: If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.\n\nHere is how you could implement the function `return_binary_or_hexa`:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(input_tuple: tuple) -> str:\n    """\n    Returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 2 and 8.\n    If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n    The binary representation should not be prefixed with \'0b\'.\n    The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with \'0x\'.\n    The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n    The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n    If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.\n    """\n    a = input_tuple[2]\n    b = input_tuple[8]\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in input_tuple:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:].upper()\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730611874, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=696, prompt_tokens=303, total_tokens=999))
