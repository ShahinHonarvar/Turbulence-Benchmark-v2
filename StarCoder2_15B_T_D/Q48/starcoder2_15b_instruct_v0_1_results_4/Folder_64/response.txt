ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To implement the function, we can iterate through the specified range of integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` and check if they are present in the tuple. If an integer is not present in the tuple, we add it to a sum. We use a loop to iterate through the range of integers and a conditional statement to check if the integer is present in the tuple. If the integer is not present, we add it to the sum. We use the `sum` function to calculate the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the tuple.\n\nWe can check if the sum is an odd number using the modulo operator (`%`) and return the binary representation string if the sum is odd or the hexadecimal representation string if the sum is even. We use the `bin` function to convert the sum to its binary representation string and the `hex` function to convert the sum to its hexadecimal representation string. We use the `replace` method to remove the prefixes `0b` and `0x` from the binary and hexadecimal representation strings, respectively.\n\nIf all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, we return an empty string. We use a `for` loop to iterate through the specified range of integers and a conditional statement to check if the integer is present in the tuple. If all integers in the specified range are present in the tuple, we return an empty string.\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a, b, _, _, _, _ = tup\n    sum_val = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum_val += i\n    if sum_val % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_val).replace("0b", "")\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_val).replace("0x", "")\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730612627, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=429, prompt_tokens=303, total_tokens=732))
