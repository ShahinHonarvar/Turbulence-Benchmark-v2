Create a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. Let `a` denote the integer stored at index 110, and `b` the integer stored at index 348.\n2. Initialize an empty list to store the integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the tuple between indices 110 and 348.\n3. Iterate through the tuple and check if the current integer is between `a + 1` and `b - 1`. If it is not, add it to the list.\n4. Calculate the sum of the integers in the list.\n5. Check if the sum is an odd number. If it is, return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n6. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n7. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, return an empty string.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(t):\n    a = t[110]\n    b = t[348]\n    missing_ints = []\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in t[110:349]:\n            missing_ints.append(i)\n    sum_missing_ints = sum(missing_ints)\n    if sum_missing_ints % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_missing_ints)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_missing_ints)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nNote that the code above does not contain any comments.\n\nThe function `return_binary_or_hexa` takes a tuple `t` of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.
