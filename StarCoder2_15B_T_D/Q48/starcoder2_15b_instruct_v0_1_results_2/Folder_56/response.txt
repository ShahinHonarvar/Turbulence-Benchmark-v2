ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To implement the function, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the tuple contains all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive): Iterate over the range from a + 1 to b - 1 and check if each integer is present in the tuple. If all integers are present, return an empty string.\n2. Calculate the sum of integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple: Iterate over the range from a + 1 to b - 1 and add each integer to the sum if it is not present in the tuple.\n3. Convert the sum to binary or hexadecimal representation: If the sum is odd, convert it to binary representation using the built-in `bin()` function. Otherwise, convert it to hexadecimal representation using the built-in `hex()` function.\n4. Format the binary or hexadecimal representation: Since the representations are strings, you can format them by removing the prefix (`0b` for binary and `0x` for hexadecimal) and leading zeros.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup[7]\n    b = tup[9]\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the steps outlined above. The function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as input and returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum of integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 7 and 9, depending on whether the sum is odd or even.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730610057, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=421, prompt_tokens=303, total_tokens=724))
