It then iterates through all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) and checks if each integer is present in the tuple. If it is not present, it adds the integer to the `sum_val` variable.\n\nNext, the function checks if the `sum_val` is an odd number. If it is, it returns the binary representation of the sum, otherwise it returns the hexadecimal representation. The binary representation is obtained by converting the `sum_val` to a binary string using the `bin` function and slicing off the first two characters to remove the `0b` prefix. Similarly, the hexadecimal representation is obtained by converting the `sum_val` to a hexadecimal string using the `hex` function, slicing off the first two characters to remove the `0x` prefix, and converting the resulting string to uppercase using the `upper` method.\n\nFinally, if all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609498, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=390, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=697))
