Parse the text specification to extract the function name, arguments, and return value.\n2. Determine the logic of the function based on the text specification.\n3. Generate Python code using the extracted information and logic.\n4. Remove any unnecessary comments from the generated code.\n5. Enclose the generated code in triple backticks.\n\nFor this example, the function name is `return_binary_or_hexa`, the argument is a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order, and the return value depends on the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 49 and 74.\n\nHere\'s the Python code that follows the above steps:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(nums):\n    """\n    Given a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order,\n    return the binary representation of the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1\n    (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 49 and 74,\n    if the sum is an odd number; otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation\n    of the sum. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 are present in the specified\n    range, return an empty string.\n    """\n    a = nums[49]\n    b = nums[74]\n    missing_nums = set(range(a + 1, b)) - set(nums[50:74])\n    sum_of_missing_nums = sum(missing_nums)\n    if sum_of_missing_nums % 2 == 0:\n        return hex(sum_of_missing_nums)[2:]\n    return bin(sum_of_missing_nums)[2:]\n```\n\nThis function extracts the values at indices 49 and 74 from the tuple, determines the missing numbers between the specified range, calculates the sum of the missing numbers, and returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum based on the specification.\n\nThe code is delimited by triple backticks to indicate the start and end of the Python code. It does not contain any comments as per the specification.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609438, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=502, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=809))
