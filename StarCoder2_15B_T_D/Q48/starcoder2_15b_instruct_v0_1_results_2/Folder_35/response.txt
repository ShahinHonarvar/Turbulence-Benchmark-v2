The function needs to perform the following tasks:\n\n1. Calculate the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 77 and 84.\n2. If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation of the sum.\n3. Otherwise, if the sum is an even number, return the hexadecimal representation of the sum.\n4. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, return an empty string.\n\nHere's how you could implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup[77]\n    b = tup[84]\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    elif sum_of_integers % 2 == 0:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return ''\n```\n\nThis function `return_binary_or_hexa` takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as input.
