The integers stored at indices 37 and 43 are denoted as 'a' and 'b', respectively. The function calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 37 and 43. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations are formatted to start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609707, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=333, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=640))
