The key is to understand the problem and identify the data structures and algorithms needed to solve it.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(t):\n    a = t[80]\n    b = t[200]\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(a+1, b):\n        if i not in t:\n            sum += i\n    if sum % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nThe code takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as input. It stores the integer at index 80 as 'a' and the integer at index 200 as 'b'. It then iterates from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) and checks if each integer is present in the tuple using the 'in' operator. If it is not present, it is added to the sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is an odd number and returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum, depending on the parity of the sum.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609994, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=269, prompt_tokens=309, total_tokens=578))
