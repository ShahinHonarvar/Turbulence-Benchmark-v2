It uses the fact that the tuple is sorted in ascending order and contains distinct nonnegative integers. The calculation is performed using set operations, which are efficient in Python. The resulting sum is then used to determine the binary or hexadecimal representation. The binary representation is returned if the sum is an odd number, and the hexadecimal representation is returned if the sum is an even number. The binary and hexadecimal representations are returned in the specified format using the built-in functions bin() and hex().', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609773, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=280, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=587))
