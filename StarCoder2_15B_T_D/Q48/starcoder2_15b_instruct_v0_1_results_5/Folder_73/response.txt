The function calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices `a` and `b`. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation is returned without the prefix `0b` and the hexadecimal representation is returned without the prefix `0x`. The binary and hexadecimal representations start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in the hexadecimal representation can be either lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` are present in the specified range in the tuple, an empty string is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730613881, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=341, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=648))
