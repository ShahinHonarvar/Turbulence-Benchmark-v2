The instructions indicate that the function should take a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. It should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive), where a is the integer at index 0 and b is the integer at index 6. If the sum is odd, the function should return the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation. The binary representation should not be prefixed with 0b, and the hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with 0x.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers: tuple) -> str:\n    a = numbers[0]\n    b = numbers[6]\n    expected_range = set(range(a + 1, b))\n    actual_range = set(numbers[1:7])\n    missing_numbers = expected_range - actual_range\n    sum_of_missing_numbers = sum(missing_numbers)\n    if sum_of_missing_numbers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_missing_numbers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_missing_numbers)[2:].upper()\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730614124, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=295, prompt_tokens=303, total_tokens=598))
