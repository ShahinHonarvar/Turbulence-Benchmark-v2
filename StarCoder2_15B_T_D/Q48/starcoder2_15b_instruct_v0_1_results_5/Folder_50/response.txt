ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To solve this problem, you need to understand the problem specification. The problem states that you have to create a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. Let's assume that the tuple is stored in a variable called `my_tuple`. The function should calculate the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple. If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation of the sum.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `return_binary_or_hexa`:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple: tuple) -> str:\n    a = my_tuple[13]\n    b = my_tuple[76]\n    numbers_in_range = set(range(a + 1, b))\n    numbers_not_in_tuple = numbers_in_range - set(my_tuple)\n    sum_of_numbers = sum(numbers_not_in_tuple)\n    if sum_of_numbers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_numbers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_numbers)[2:]\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730613623, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=294, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=601))
