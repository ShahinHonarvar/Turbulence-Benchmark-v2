ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To solve this problem, you can use the fact that the given tuple of distinct nonnegative integers is sorted in ascending order. You can use the `index` method to find the indices of the integers at positions 7 and 9 in the tuple. Then, you can use a `for` loop to iterate over the integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) and check if they are present in the tuple. If an integer is not present in the tuple, you can add it to a list of missing integers. Finally, you can calculate the sum of the missing integers and return the binary or hexadecimal representation string depending on whether the sum is an odd or even number.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup.index(7)\n    b = tup.index(9)\n    missing = []\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            missing.append(i)\n    sum_missing = sum(missing)\n    if sum_missing % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_missing)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_missing)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nThe `index` method is used to find the indices of the integers at positions 7 and 9 in the tuple.
