ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="Let's approach this problem by identifying the key steps involved in the function'return_binary_or_hexa'. We know that the function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order, and we need to find a way to access the integers stored at index 2 and 5. Once we have those values, we can calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 2 and 5. If the sum is an odd number, we need to return the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, we need to return the hexadecimal representation of the sum. To ensure that the binary and hexadecimal representations do not have leading zeros, we can use the format() function to format the output accordingly.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function'return_binary_or_hexa':\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(input_tuple: tuple) -> str:\n    a = input_tuple[2]\n    b = input_tuple[5]\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in input_tuple[2:5]:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return format(sum_of_integers, 'b')\n    else:\n        return format(sum_of_integers, 'x')\n```\n\nThis function'return_binary_or_hexa' takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as input, and returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 2 and 5, depending on whether the sum is an odd number or not. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations are formatted using the format() function to ensure they do not have leading zeros.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730613236, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=452, prompt_tokens=303, total_tokens=755))
