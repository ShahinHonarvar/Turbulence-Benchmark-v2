Extract the integers 'a' and 'b' from the given tuple using tuple unpacking.\n2. Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 29 and 53.\n3. If the sum is an odd number, convert it to its binary representation string.\n4. Otherwise, if the sum is an even number, convert it to its hexadecimal representation string.\n5. Remove the prefix ('0b' for binary and '0x' for hexadecimal) from the representation string.\n6. Format the representation string to start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n7. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, return an empty string.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers: tuple) -> str:\n    a, b = numbers[29], numbers[53]\n    sum_of_missing = sum(x for x in range(a + 1, b) if x not in numbers[29:54])\n    if sum_of_missing % 2 == 1:\n        return format(sum_of_missing, 'b')\n    else:\n        return format(sum_of_missing, 'x')\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730613598, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=328, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=635))
