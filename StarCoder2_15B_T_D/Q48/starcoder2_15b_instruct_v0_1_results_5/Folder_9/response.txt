Parse the text specification to extract the information about the tuple, index 70, and index 200.\n2. Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 70 and 200.\n3. If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation string of the sum. Otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n4. Ensure that the binary and hexadecimal representations start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n5. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, return an empty string.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(arg):\n    tuple_of_ints = arg[0]\n    a = tuple_of_ints[70]\n    b = tuple_of_ints[200]\n    sum_of_ints = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tuple_of_ints[70:200]:\n            sum_of_ints += i\n    if sum_of_ints % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_ints)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_ints)[2:].upper()\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730613166, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=369, prompt_tokens=309, total_tokens=678))
