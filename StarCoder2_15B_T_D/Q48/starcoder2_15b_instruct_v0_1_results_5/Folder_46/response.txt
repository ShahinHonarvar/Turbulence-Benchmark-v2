The function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as input.\n2. Let 'a' denote the integer stored at index 10, and 'b' the integer stored at index 79.\n3. The function should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 79.\n4. If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n5. The binary representation should not be prefixed with '0b'.\n6. The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with '0x'.\n7. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.\n8. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase.\n9. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.\n\nBased on these requirements, we can define the function `return_binary_or_hexa` as follows:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(t: tuple) -> str:\n    a = t[10]\n    b = t[79]\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in t:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        binary_representation = bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n        return binary_representation\n    else:\n        hexadecimal_representation = hex(sum_of_integers)[2:].upper()\n        return hexadecimal_representation\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use the `bin` function to obtain the binary representation of the sum, and the `hex` function to obtain the hexadecimal representation. We use the `[2:]` indexing to remove the prefix `'0b'` and `'0x'` from the binary and hexadecimal representations, respectively. We also use the `upper` method to convert the letters in the hexadecimal representation to uppercase.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730613583, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=507, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=814))
