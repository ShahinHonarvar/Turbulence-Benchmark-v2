Extract information from the text specification: Identify the function name, argument name, conditions, and calculations.\n2. Determine the required Python code: Based on the information extracted, determine the required Python code to meet the conditions and calculations.\n3. Write the Python code: Write the Python code according to the specification and follow the provided guidelines.\n4. Generate the delimited Python code: Generate the delimited Python code by wrapping the Python code with triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup: tuple) -> str:\n    a = tup[20]\n    b = tup[35]\n    sum_of_missing_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum_of_missing_integers += i\n    if sum_of_missing_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_missing_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_missing_integers)[2:]\n```\n\nThe code starts by extracting information from the text specification, such as the function name, argument name, conditions, and calculations. The function takes a tuple as input and returns a string. The tuple is assumed to contain distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. The function calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 20 and 35. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum.\n\nThe Python code is then generated based on the information extracted. The code starts by extracting the integers at indices 20 and 35 from the tuple and assigning them to variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The code then calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 20 and 35. The code iterates over the range `a + 1` to `b - 1` and checks if each integer is present in the tuple. If it's not present, the integer is added to the `sum_of_missing_integers` variable.\n\nThe code then checks if the `sum_of_missing_integers` is an odd number. If it is, the code returns the binary representation of the sum. Otherwise, the code returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum.\n\nThe binary and hexadecimal representations are generated using the built-in `bin()` and `hex()` functions. The `bin()` function returns the binary representation of an integer as a string. The `hex()` function returns the hexadecimal representation of an integer as a string. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove the `0b` prefix from the binary representation and the `0x` prefix from the hexadecimal representation.\n\nFinally, the delimited Python code is generated by wrapping the Python code with triple backticks.
