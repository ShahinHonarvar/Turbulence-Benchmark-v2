Extract the required information from the text specification.\n2. Write the Python code to implement the required logic.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(t):\n    a = t[38]\n    b = t[52]\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in t:\n            sum += i\n    if sum % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nThe code iterates over all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 and checks if they are present in the tuple. If they are not present, their values are added to the sum. The sum is then checked to determine whether it is an odd number or an even number. If it is an odd number, the binary representation of the sum is returned; otherwise, the hexadecimal representation of the sum is returned. The hexadecimal representation is converted to uppercase using the `upper()` method.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730613724, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=248, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=555))
