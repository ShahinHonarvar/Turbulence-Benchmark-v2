The code should be delimited by triple backticks.\n\nThe provided text specification describes a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. The function should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 48 and 76. If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.\n\nHere is the Python code that follows the specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup[48]\n    b = tup[76]\n    sum_of_missing = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum_of_missing += i\n    if sum_of_missing % 2 == 0:\n        return hex(sum_of_missing)[2:].rstrip("L")\n    else:\n        return bin(sum_of_missing)[2:]\n```\n\nThis function first extracts the integers at indices 48 and 76 from the tuple. It then calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 48 and 76. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation of the sum by converting it to a binary string and removing the \'0b\' prefix. Otherwise, the function returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum by converting it to a hexadecimal string and removing the \'0x\' prefix.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730613200, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=383, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=690))
