ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='The function `return_binary_or_hexa` takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as its only argument. The tuple is assumed to be of length at least 44. The function calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 37 and 43. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation should not be prefixed with \'0b\' and should start with the most significant digit. The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with \'0x\' and should start with the most significant digit. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):\n    a = my_tuple[37]\n    b = my_tuple[43]\n    missing_nums = []\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in my_tuple:\n            missing_nums.append(i)\n    if not missing_nums:\n        return ""\n    sum_missing_nums = sum(missing_nums)\n    if sum_missing_nums % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_missing_nums)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_missing_nums)[2:].upper()\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730613353, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=335, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=642))
