First, we can define a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as an argument. Then, we can use Python's built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of all integers in the specified range that are not present in the tuple. After that, we can use the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if the sum is an odd number. If it is, we can use Python's built-in `bin` function to convert the sum to its binary representation string. Otherwise, we can use Python's built-in `hex` function to convert the sum to its hexadecimal representation string. Finally, we can use Python's string formatting to remove the '0b' prefix from the binary representation and remove the '0x' prefix from the hexadecimal representation.\n\nHere is the Python code that meets the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers: tuple) -> str:\n    a = numbers[10]\n    b = numbers[12]\n    missing_numbers = set(range(a + 1, b)) - set(numbers[a + 1:b])\n    sum_of_missing_numbers = sum(missing_numbers)\n    if sum_of_missing_numbers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_missing_numbers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_missing_numbers)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use Python's built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of all integers in the specified range that are not present in the tuple. We then use the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if the sum is an odd number. If it is, we use Python's built-in `bin` function to convert the sum to its binary representation string.
