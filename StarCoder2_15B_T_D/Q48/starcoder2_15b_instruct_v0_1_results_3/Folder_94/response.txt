The function is called `return_binary_or_hexa` and takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. Let `a` denote the integer stored at index 42, and `b` the integer stored at index 87. The function should calculate the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 42 and 87. If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation should not be prefixed with `0b`. The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with `0x`. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup[42]\n    b = tup[87]\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tup:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first extract `a` and `b` from the tuple using `tup[42]` and `tup[87]`, respectively. Then, we iterate over all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` and check if each integer is present in the tuple. If it is not present, we add it to the `sum_of_integers` variable. After the iteration, we check if the sum is an odd number. If it is, we return the binary representation of the sum by converting it to a string using `bin(sum_of_integers)`. Otherwise, we return the hexadecimal representation of the sum by converting it to a string using `hex(sum_of_integers)` and uppercasing it using `.upper()`. The `[2:]` slicing notation is used to remove the `0b` or `0x` prefix from the binary or hexadecimal representation, respectively.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730611719, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=590, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=897))
