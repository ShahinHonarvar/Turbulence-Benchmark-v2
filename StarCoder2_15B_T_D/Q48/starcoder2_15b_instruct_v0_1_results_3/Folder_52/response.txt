Extract the elements of the tuple into a list, and sort it in ascending order.\n2. Find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to a + 1 in the sorted list. This represents the starting index of the range of integers to be considered.\n3. Find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to b in the sorted list. This represents the ending index of the range of integers to be considered.\n4. Loop over the sorted list from the starting index to the ending index, and check if each element is present in the specified range. If not, add it to a sum variable.\n5. Check if the sum is an odd number. If it is, return the binary representation of the sum. Otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation of the sum.\n6. If all elements from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, return an empty string.\n\nHere\'s a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(t):\n    lst = list(t)\n    lst.sort()\n    start = next((i for i, x in enumerate(lst) if x >= a + 1), None)\n    end = next((i for i, x in enumerate(lst) if x >= b), None)\n    if start is None or end is None:\n        return ""\n    sum_val = 0\n    for i in range(start, end):\n        if lst[i] < a + 1 or lst[i] > b - 1:\n            sum_val += lst[i]\n    if sum_val % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_val)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_val)[2:].lower()\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730611206, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=444, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=751))
