Create a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes a single argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n2. Define two variables, `a` and `b`, to store the integers at index 0 and 4, respectively.\n3. Create a list of integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive).\n4. Remove all integers in the specified range from the tuple that are present in the list.\n5. If the remaining list is empty, return an empty string.\n6. Calculate the sum of the remaining list.\n7. If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation of the sum, otherwise return the hexadecimal representation.\n8. Convert the sum to binary or hexadecimal according to the requirement.\n9. Return the binary or hexadecimal representation string as specified.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tup):\n    a = tup[0]\n    b = tup[4]\n    lst = list(range(a + 1, b))\n    remaining = [num for num in lst if num not in tup]\n    if not remaining:\n        return ""\n    sum_val = sum(remaining)\n    if sum_val % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_val)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_val)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the specification step by step to create Python code that meets the given requirements. The function `return_binary_or_hexa` takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as an argument. It stores the integers at index 0 and 4 in variables `a` and `b`, respectively. It creates a list of integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive). It removes all integers in the specified range from the tuple that are present in the list. If the remaining list is empty, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the remaining list. It checks if the sum is an odd number and returns the binary representation of the sum if it is, otherwise it returns the hexadecimal representation. It converts the sum to binary or hexadecimal according to the requirement. It returns the binary or hexadecimal representation string as specified.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730610735, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=521, prompt_tokens=303, total_tokens=824))
