It then calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 44 and 67. If the sum is an odd number, it returns the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum. The binary representation is obtained by converting the sum to binary using the built-in `bin` function and removing the '0b' prefix using slicing. The hexadecimal representation is obtained similarly by converting the sum to hexadecimal using the built-in `hex` function and removing the '0x' prefix using slicing. The hexadecimal representation is converted to uppercase using the `upper` method. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730611393, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=343, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=650))
