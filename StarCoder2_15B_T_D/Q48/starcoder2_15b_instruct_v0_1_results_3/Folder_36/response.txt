The function should not contain any comments or Python code that is not part of the specification. The Python code should be delimited by triple backticks.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements the specified functionality:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers):\n    """\n    Returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum of certain integers depending on the sum\'s value.\n    """\n    start_index = 110\n    end_index = 348\n    sum_of_integers = 0\n    for i in range(start_index + 1, end_index):\n        if i not in numbers:\n            sum_of_integers += i\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:].upper()\n```\n\nThe function `return_binary_or_hexa` takes a tuple of nonnegative integers as input. It calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices `110` and `348`. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations are formatted to remove their prefixes (`0b` and `0x`, respectively) and start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730610969, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=368, prompt_tokens=311, total_tokens=679))
