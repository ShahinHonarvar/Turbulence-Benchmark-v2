It finds the integers between indices 60 and 90 and calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 60 and 90. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation is returned without the '0b' prefix and the hexadecimal representation is returned in uppercase without the '0x' prefix. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, an empty string is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730611652, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=302, prompt_tokens=307, total_tokens=609))
