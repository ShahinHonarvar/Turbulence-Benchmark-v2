Extract the required information from the text specification:\n   - Extract the indices 275 and 871.\n   - Extract the integers at those indices.\n   - Extract the range of integers from a + 1 to b - 1.\n   - Extract the condition on the sum of those integers.\n2. Write the implementation of the function:\n   - Create a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` with one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n   - Declare variables `a` and `b` to store the integers at indices 275 and 871, respectively.\n   - Create a list of integers from a + 1 to b - 1.\n   - Filter the list to remove any integers that are present in the tuple.\n   - Calculate the sum of the remaining integers.\n   - Check if the sum is odd.\n   - If the sum is odd, return the binary representation of the sum using the `bin` function.\n   - Otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation of the sum using the `hex` function.\n3. Write the Python code:\n   - Use triple backticks to delimit the Python code.\n   - Write the implementation of the function, ensuring that it meets the specifications.\n   - Ensure that the code follows the given instructions and does not contain any comments.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(numbers):\n    a = numbers[275]\n    b = numbers[871]\n    integers = list(range(a + 1, b))\n    filtered_integers = [num for num in integers if num not in numbers[275:871]]\n    sum_of_integers = sum(filtered_integers)\n    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:\n        return bin(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n    else:\n        return hex(sum_of_integers)[2:]\n```\n\nThis function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. It extracts the integers at indices 275 and 871, and calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 275 and 871. If the sum is an odd number, it returns the binary representation of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730611288, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=554, prompt_tokens=311, total_tokens=865))
