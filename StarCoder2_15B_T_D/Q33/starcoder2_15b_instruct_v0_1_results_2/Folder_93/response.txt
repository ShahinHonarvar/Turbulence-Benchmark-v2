Extract the substring from index 54 to 82 (exclusive) from the given string.\n2. Create a list of vowels by checking each character in the substring against a list of vowel characters.\n3. Filter the list of vowels to only include those that are greater than `=` and smaller than or equal to `@`.\n4. Return the filtered list of vowels.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    substring = string[54:82]\n    vowels = [char for char in substring if char in 'aeiou']\n    filtered_vowels = [vowel for vowel in vowels if vowel > '=' and vowel <= '@']\n    return filtered_vowels\n```\n\nThis implementation extracts the substring from index 54 to 82 (exclusive), creates a list of vowels by checking each character in the substring against a list of vowel characters, and filters the list of vowels to only include those that are greater than `=` and smaller than or equal to `@`. It then returns the filtered list of vowels.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730554951, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=296, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=465))
