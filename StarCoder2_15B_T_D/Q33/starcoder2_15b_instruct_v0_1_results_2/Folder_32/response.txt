Identify the function name and its arguments: The function name is `return_vowels` and it takes one argument, a string.\n2. Understand the task: The function should return a list of all vowel English letters between index 45 and index 76 that are greater than `b` and smaller than or equal to `z`. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n3. Break down the task into small steps: To accomplish the task, you need to first check if the string contains any vowel English letters between index 45 and index 76. If there are any, you need to filter them based on the given conditions and return the filtered list.\n4. Write the Python code: You can use the `filter` function to filter vowel English letters between index 45 and index 76 and the `ord` function to check if the letters are greater than `b` and smaller than or equal to `z`.\n\nHere\'s how you can create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = "aeiou"\n    filtered_letters = list(filter(lambda letter: letter in vowels and 45 <= string.index(letter) < 76 and ord(letter) > ord("b") and ord(letter) <= ord("z"), string))\n    return filtered_letters\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as an argument and returns a list of all vowel English letters between index 45 (inclusive) and index 76 (exclusive) that are greater than `b` and smaller than or equal to `z`. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe `filter` function is used to filter vowel English letters between index 45 and index 76. The `ord` function is used to check if the letters are greater than `b` and smaller than or equal to `z`. The `string.index(letter)` expression is used to check if the index of the letter is between 45 and 76.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730554492, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=479, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=648))
