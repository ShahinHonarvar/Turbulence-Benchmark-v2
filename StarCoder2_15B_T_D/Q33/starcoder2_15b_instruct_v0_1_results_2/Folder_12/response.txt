The function `return_vowels` is defined to take one argument, a string, and return a list of vowels from the given string. The vowels should be between index 13 (inclusive) and index 37 (exclusive), and they should be greater than `Z` and smaller than or equal to `}`. This is a common problem in computer science, and there are many ways to solve it. Here's one way to implement it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        if i >= 13 and i < 37 and c.isalpha() and c.lower() in 'aeiou' and 'Z' < c <= '}':\n            vowels.append(c)\n    return vowels\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730554325, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=204, prompt_tokens=168, total_tokens=372))
