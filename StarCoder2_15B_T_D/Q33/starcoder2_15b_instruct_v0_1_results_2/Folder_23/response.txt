Within the function, we can iterate over the characters in the string and check if they are vowels, are located within the specified index range, and are greater than `&` and smaller than or equal to `T`. If a character meets these criteria, it is added to a list of vowels. Finally, the list of vowels is returned.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        if c in 'AEIOU' and 56 <= i < 96 and '&' < c <= 'T':\n            vowels.append(c)\n    return vowels\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730554409, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=189, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=358))
