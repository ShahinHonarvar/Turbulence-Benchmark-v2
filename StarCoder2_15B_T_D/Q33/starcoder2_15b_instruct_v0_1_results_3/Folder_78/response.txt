From the given instructions, we can deduce that the function `return_vowels` takes a single argument, a string, and should return a list of vowels from the string that are located between indices 46 and 90, and are greater than `@` and less than or equal to `[`.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        if i >= 46 and i < 90 and c.isalpha() and c.lower() in "aeiou":\n            vowels.append(c)\n    return vowels\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730555647, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=174, prompt_tokens=168, total_tokens=342))
