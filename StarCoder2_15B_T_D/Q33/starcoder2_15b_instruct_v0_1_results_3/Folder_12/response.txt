The function should return a list of vowels from the given string that are between indices 13 and 37 (exclusive), and are greater than `Z` and smaller than or equal to `}`.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `return_vowels` function:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        if i >= 13 and i < 37 and c.isalpha() and c.lower() in 'aeiou' and c > 'Z' and c <= '}':\n            vowels.append(c)\n    return vowels\n```\n\nThe function iterates over the characters in the string using a for loop. It checks if the character is between indices 13 and 37 (exclusive), is an English vowel, and is greater than `Z` and smaller than or equal to `}`. If all conditions are met, the character is appended to the `vowels` list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730555107, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=248, prompt_tokens=168, total_tokens=416))
