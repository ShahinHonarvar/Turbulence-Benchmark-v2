Additionally, it checks if the character is greater than `@` and less than or equal to `~`.\n- If the condition is met, the current character is appended to the list `vowels`.\n- After the loop, the function returns the list of vowels.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730555500, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=269, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=438))
