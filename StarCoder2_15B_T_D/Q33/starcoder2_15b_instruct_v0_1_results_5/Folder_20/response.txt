Define a function called `return_vowels` that takes one argument, `string`.\n2. Define a list of vowels to check for between index 59 (inclusive) and index 61 (exclusive).\n3. Iterate through the given string and check if each character is a vowel, greater than `+`, and smaller than or equal to `h`.\n4. If the condition is met, append the character to a list of vowels.\n5. Return the list of vowels.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = [char for char in string if char.isalpha() and char.lower() in 'aeiou']\n    result = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(string):\n        if i >= 59 and i < 61 and char.isalpha() and char.lower() in vowels and char > '+' and char <= 'h':\n            result.append(char)\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation first defines a list of vowels to check for between index 59 (inclusive) and index 61 (exclusive). It then iterates through the given string and checks if each character is a vowel, greater than `+`, and smaller than or equal to `h`. If the condition is met, the character is appended to a list of vowels. Finally, the list of vowels is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730556734, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=390, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=559))
