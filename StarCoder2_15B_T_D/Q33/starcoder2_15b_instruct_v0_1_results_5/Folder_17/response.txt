Extract the function name and arguments from the text specification.\n2. Extract the logic to be implemented from the text specification. In this case, it involves extracting all vowel English letters between index 60 (inclusive) and index 99 (exclusive) that are greater than character j and smaller than or equal to character n.\n3. Write Python code that implements the logic.\n\nHere is an example of how you could create Python code that meets the given specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        if i >= 60 and i < 99 and c in 'aeiou' and 'j' < c <= 'n':\n            vowels.append(c)\n    return vowels\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as an argument. It iterates through the string, checking each character to see if it is a vowel English letter between index 60 (inclusive) and index 99 (exclusive) and is greater than character j and smaller than or equal to character n. If the character meets these criteria, it is added to the `vowels` list. Finally, the function returns the list of vowels.\n\nNote that this Python code does not contain any comments and is delimited only by triple backticks.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730556703, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=311, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=480))
