Parse the specification: Understand the specification by breaking it down into its constituent parts. In this case, the function name, arguments, and the conditions for returning vowels.\n2. Write the Python code: Translate the specification into Python code. Use the `return_vowels` function name and the `string` argument.\n3. Implement the logic: Implement the logic to return the list of vowels between indices 10 and 97 that are greater than R and smaller than or equal to b.\n4. Test the code: Test the code with various inputs to ensure it meets the specification.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code based on the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        if i > 10 and i < 97 and c.isalpha() and c.lower() > 'r' and c.lower() <= 'b':\n            vowels.append(c)\n    return vowels\n```\n\nThis code implements the logic to return the list of vowels between indices 10 and 97 that are greater than R and smaller than or equal to b. It checks if the character is an alpha character, and if it is, checks if it is greater than R and smaller than or equal to b. If both conditions are met, the character is added to the `vowels` list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730556192, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=338, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=507))
