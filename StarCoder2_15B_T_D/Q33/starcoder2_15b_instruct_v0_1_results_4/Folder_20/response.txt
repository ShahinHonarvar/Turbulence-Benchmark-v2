The function should return a list of vowel English letters between index 59 (inclusive) and index 61 (exclusive) that are greater than character `+` and smaller than or equal to character `h`. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `return_vowels` function:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        if c in 'aeiou' and 59 <= i < 61 and '+' < c <= 'h':\n            vowels.append(c)\n    return vowels\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the characters in the given string. If a character is a vowel English letter and its index is between 59 (inclusive) and 61 (exclusive), it is added to the `vowels` list. The function returns the `vowels` list at the end.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730555972, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=248, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=417))
