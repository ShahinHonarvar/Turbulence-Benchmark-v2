We then filter out the matches that are greater than \'I\' and smaller than or equal to \'X\'. Finally, we return the filtered matches as a list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730554049, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=224, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=393))
