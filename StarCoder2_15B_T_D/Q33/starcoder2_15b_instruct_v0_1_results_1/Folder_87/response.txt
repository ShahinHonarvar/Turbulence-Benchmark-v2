Define the function with `def` and the function name `return_vowels`.\n2. Define the function's argument with `(` and `)`.\n3. Define the function's body with `:` and an indented block.\n4. Create a list to store the vowels with `[]`.\n5. Iterate over the string with `for` and `in`.\n6. Check if the character is a vowel with `in` and `['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']`.\n7. Check if the index is between 34 (inclusive) and 58 (exclusive) with `<` and `>`.\n8. Check if the character is greater than 'b' with `>`.\n9. Check if the character is smaller than or equal to 'o' with `<=`.\n10. Add the character to the list with `append`.\n11. Return the list with `return`.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(string):\n        if c in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] and 34 <= i < 58 and c > 'b' and c <= 'o':\n            vowels.append(c)\n    return vowels\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730554116, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=353, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=522))
