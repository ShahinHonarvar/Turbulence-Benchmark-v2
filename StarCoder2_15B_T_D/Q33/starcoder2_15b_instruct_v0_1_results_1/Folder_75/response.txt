If all conditions are met, the character is added to the result list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730554022, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=271, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=440))
