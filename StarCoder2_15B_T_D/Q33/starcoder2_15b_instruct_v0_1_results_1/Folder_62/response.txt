The function should return a list of all vowel English letters between index 14 (inclusive) and index 60 (exclusive) that are greater than character D and smaller than or equal to character v. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the Python code that corresponds to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = [char for char in string[14:60] if char.isalpha() and char.lower() in 'aeiou' and char > 'D' and char <= 'v']\n    return vowels\n```\n\nThe code defines a function `return_vowels` that takes one argument, a string. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the characters of the string between index 14 (inclusive) and index 60 (exclusive). The comprehension filters out non-alphabetic characters and vowels that are greater than D and smaller than or equal to v. The filtered characters are stored in the list `vowels`. The function returns the list of vowels.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730553926, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=267, prompt_tokens=169, total_tokens=436))
