This method takes two arguments: the index at which to insert the new element, and the element to be inserted. In our case, the index is 69 and the element to be inserted is 92.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    lst.insert(69, 92)\n    return lst\n```\n\nThe `insert` method inserts the element at the specified index and shifts the remaining elements to the right. Therefore, the returned list will have one more element than the given list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730531875, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=178, prompt_tokens=143, total_tokens=321))
