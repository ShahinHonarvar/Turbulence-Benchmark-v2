This means that the returned list should have one more element than the given list.\n\nHere's how we can create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    lst.insert(90, 80)\n    return lst\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730532702, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=130, prompt_tokens=143, total_tokens=273))
