ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code that meets the provided text specification, you can use the following steps:\n1. Understand the text specification: The text specification states that a function called `insert_at_index` is to be created that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [13, 46] has been inserted at index 84.\n2. Write the Python code: The Python code should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n3. Generate the Python code: To generate the Python code, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    return lst[:84] + [13, 46] + lst[84:]\n```\n\n4. Test the Python code: You can test the generated Python code by providing some sample inputs and verifying the output against the expected results:\n\n```python\nassert insert_at_index([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 46]\nassert insert_at_index([]) == [13, 46]\nassert insert_at_index([6, 7, 8]) == [6, 7, 8, 13, 46]\n```\n\nHere is how you can provide the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    return lst[:84] + [13, 46] + lst[84:]\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730532635, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=355, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=503))
