Understand the specification: The text specification states that a function named `insert_at_index` is to be written that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that `[98, 22]` has been inserted at index 24.\n2. Define the function: The function should be defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and the argument list enclosed in parentheses.\n3. Return a list: The function should return a list using the return keyword.\n4. Identify the inserted list: The inserted list, `[98, 22]`, is specified as being inserted at index 24.\n5. Generate the returned list: To generate the returned list, we can use the list concatenation operator (`+`) to combine the given list with the inserted list at the specified index.\n6. Delimit the code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code that fulfills the specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    return lst[:24] + [98, 22] + lst[24:]\n```\n\nThe function `insert_at_index` takes one argument, a list. It returns a list that is identical except that `[98, 22]` has been inserted at index 24. The inserted list is concatenated to the given list using the list concatenation operator (`+`).
