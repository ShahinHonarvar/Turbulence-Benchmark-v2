In this case, the specification states that you need to write a function called `insert_at_index` that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 80 has been inserted at index 90. This means that the returned list should have one more element than the given list, and the element at index 90 in the returned list should be 80.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    """\n    Insert 80 at index 90 in a list and return the updated list.\n    """\n    lst.insert(90, 80)\n    return lst\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730532203, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=169, prompt_tokens=143, total_tokens=312))
