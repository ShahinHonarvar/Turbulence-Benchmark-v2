In this case, the text specification is straightforward: write a function called `insert_at_index` that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 92 has been inserted at index 69 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    lst.insert(69, 92)\n    return lst\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730533300, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=133, prompt_tokens=143, total_tokens=276))
