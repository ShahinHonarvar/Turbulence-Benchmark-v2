ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code according to the text specification, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the text specification: You are given a text specification that says "Write a function called \'insert_at_index\' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 232 has been inserted at index 166 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list."\n2. Understand the requirements: The function should take a list as an argument, insert the value 232 at index 166, and return a list with one more element than the given list.\n3. Write the Python code: You can create a function called `insert_at_index` that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with 232 inserted at index 166.\n4. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited by triple backticks to indicate the start and end of the code block.\n\nHere\'s how you can create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(lst):\n    """\n    Insert the value 232 at index 166 in the given list and return a new list.\n    """\n    lst.insert(166, 232)\n    return lst\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730533740, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=292, prompt_tokens=145, total_tokens=437))
