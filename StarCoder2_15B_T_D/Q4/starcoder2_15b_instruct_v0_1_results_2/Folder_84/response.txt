Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Understand the specification: The specification states that we need to write a function called `all_pos_ints_exclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 50 to index 92, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\n2. Write the function signature: The function signature is the first line of the Python code and it includes the function name, the arguments, and the return type. In this case, the function signature would be `def all_pos_ints_exclusive(nums):`.\n\n3. Write the function body: The function body is the code that is executed when the function is called. In this case, we need to loop through the list of integers and check if each integer is positive. If it is, we add it to the result list.\n\n4. Define the return value: The function should return the list of all positive integers from index 50 to index 92, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\n5. Write the tests: It's a good practice to write tests for your code to ensure it works correctly. In this case, you can write tests to verify that the function returns the expected output for different inputs.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_pos_ints_exclusive(nums):\n    result = []\n    for num in nums[50:92]:\n        if num > 0:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function `all_pos_ints_exclusive` takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all positive integers from index 50 to index 92, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.\n\nThe function iterates through the given list of integers and checks if each integer is positive. If it is, it adds it to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.\n\nNote that the function uses the slice notation `nums[50:92]` to access the elements from index 50 to index 92, both exclusive.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730470305, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=519, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=667))
