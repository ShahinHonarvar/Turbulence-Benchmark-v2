ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To write a Python function that returns all integers divisible by 93 from index 52 to 53, we can use a list comprehension to filter the list of integers. The list comprehension will iterate through the list and select only those integers that are divisible by 93 and are located at index 52 or 53.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function using list comprehension:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(lst):\n    return [x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if x % 93 == 0 and i in (52, 53)]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to filter the list of integers. The list comprehension iterates through the list and selects only those integers that are divisible by 93 and are located at index 52 or 53. The `enumerate` function is used to obtain the index of each element in the list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730519049, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=211, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=366))
