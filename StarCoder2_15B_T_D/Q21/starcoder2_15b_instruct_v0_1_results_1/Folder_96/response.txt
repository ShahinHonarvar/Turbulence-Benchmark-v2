The function should take a list of integers as an argument and return a new list containing only those integers that are divisible by 2 and are located in the specified index range.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves this problem:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(ints_list):\n    return [x for i, x in enumerate(ints_list) if i >= 20 and i <= 20 and x % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThe function `all_ints_div_by_num` takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list containing only those integers that are divisible by 2 and are located in the specified index range. The list comprehension iterates over the list and checks the index of each element using `enumerate`. It then checks if the index is within the specified range and if the element is divisible by 2. If both conditions are met, the element is added to the resulting list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730519158, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=226, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=380))
