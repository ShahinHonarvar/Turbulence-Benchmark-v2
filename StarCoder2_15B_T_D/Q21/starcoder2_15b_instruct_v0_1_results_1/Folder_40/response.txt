Then, we will create a Python function with the specified name and argument. The function will iterate through the list of integers and check if each integer is divisible by the specified number. If the integer is divisible by the specified number and its index is within the specified range, it will be added to the result list. Finally, the result list will be returned.\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(ints):\n    result = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(ints):\n        if num % 2 == 0 and 0 <= i <= 0:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```\n\n\nThis implementation creates a Python function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function iterates through the list and checks if each integer is divisible by 2 and if its index is within the specified range. If both conditions are met, the integer is added to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730518772, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=243, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=395))
