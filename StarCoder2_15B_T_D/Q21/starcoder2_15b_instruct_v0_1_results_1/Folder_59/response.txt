ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='- To create Python code according to the text specification, we need to understand what the specification means. In this case, the specification asks us to write a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by 9 from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\n- To create Python code that follows the specification, we can use the following steps:\n    1. Create a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a single argument `nums`, which is a list of integers.\n    2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the integers divisible by 9.\n    3. Loop through each element in `nums` and check if it is divisible by 9 using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is, append it to the `result` list.\n    4. Return the `result` list.\n    5. Delimit the Python code with triple backticks to indicate that it is a code block.\n\n- Here is the implementation of the function `all_ints_div_by_num`:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    result = []\n    for num in nums:\n        if num % 9 == 0:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730518911, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=312, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=464))
