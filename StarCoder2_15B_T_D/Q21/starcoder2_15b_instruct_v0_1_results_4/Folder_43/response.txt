We can achieve this by iterating through the list and checking each integer's divisibility by -64, and then appending it to the output list if it is divisible.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `all_ints_div_by_num`:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    output = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if i >= 10 and i <= 37 and num % -64 == 0:\n            output.append(num)\n    return output\n```\n\nThe function `all_ints_div_by_num` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of all integers divisible by -64 from index 10 to index 37, both inclusive.
