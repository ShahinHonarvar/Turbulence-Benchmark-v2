ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code according to the given text specification, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Parse the text specification: Since the text specification is surrounded by angle brackets, we can use regular expressions to extract the text within the brackets.\n2. Understand the specification: In this case, the specification is to write a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -63 from index 31 to index 72, both inclusive.\n3. Generate Python code: We can use Python's built-in functions and syntax to generate the code that meets the specification.\n4. Format the code: To ensure that the code is formatted correctly, we can use tools such as autoformatters or manual indentation to make the code readable.\n5. Delimit the code: To delimit the code, we can use triple backticks to indicate the start and end of the code block.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_num` function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for i, num in enumerate(nums) if i >= 31 and i <= 72 and num % -63 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to filter out the integers that are divisible by -63 from index 31 to index 72, both inclusive. It iterates over the list of integers and checks the index and divisibility of each integer.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730520616, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=350, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=505))
