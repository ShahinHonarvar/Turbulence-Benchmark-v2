The function should be named `all_ints_div_by_num`.\n2. The function should take one argument, a list of integers.\n3. The function should return a list of all integers that are divisible by -59 and are located in the range from index 42 to index 89, both inclusive.\n4. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function `all_ints_div_by_num` in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(int_list):\n    result = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(int_list):\n        if i >= 42 and i <= 89 and num % -59 == 0:\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730520335, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=268, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=423))
