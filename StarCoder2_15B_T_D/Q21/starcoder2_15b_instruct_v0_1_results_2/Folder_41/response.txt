Parse the text specification: Identify the function name, arguments, and expected behavior from the text.\n2. Generate Python code: Write the function definition with the given name and arguments, and implement the logic to return the list of integers divisible by 5 within the specified range.\n3. Delimit the code: Delimit the generated code using triple backticks to ensure it is recognized as Python code and not treated as a comment.\n\nHere\'s how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    """\n    Returns the list of all integers divisible by 5 from index 0 to index 5, both inclusive.\n    If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n    """\n    return [num for num in nums[0:6] if num % 5 == 0]\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a list comprehension to filter the integers divisible by 5 from the given list. The slicing `[0:6]` is used to restrict the range to index 0 to index 5, both inclusive. The modulo operator (`%`) is used to check if the number is divisible by 5. The resulting list is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730519406, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=286, prompt_tokens=152, total_tokens=438))
