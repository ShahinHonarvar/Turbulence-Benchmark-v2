ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code that meets the given specification, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Analyze the text specification: The text specification provides a clear description of the desired Python function. It mentions the function name, the input argument, the return value, and the expected behavior.\n\n2. Understand the requirements: The specification states that the function should take a list of integers as input and return the list of all integers divisible by -63 from index 31 to index 72, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\n3. Design the solution: To meet these requirements, you can create a Python function named `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of all integers divisible by -63 from index 31 to index 72, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\n4. Implement the solution: Here's an example implementation of the Python function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(ints_list):\n    divisible_ints = []\n    for i in range(31, 73):\n        if ints_list[i] % -63 == 0:\n            divisible_ints.append(ints_list[i])\n    return divisible_ints\n```\n\n5. Test the solution: To verify that the solution meets the specified requirements, you can write tests that cover different scenarios. For example, you can create a list of integers and check that the function returns the expected list of integers divisible by -63 from index 31 to index 72, both inclusive. You can also create a list of integers and check that the function returns an empty list if no such integers exist in the specified range.\n\nHere's an example of how you can test the `all_ints_div_by_num` function:\n\n```python\nints_list = [i for i in range(100)]\ndivisible_ints = all_ints_div_by_num(ints_list)\nassert divisible_ints == [i for i in range(100) if i % 63 == 0 and 31 <= i <= 72]\nints_list = [i for i in range(100)]\ndivisible_ints = all_ints_div_by_num(ints_list)\nassert divisible_ints == []\n```\n\n6. Delimit the solution: The specification states that the Python code should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks. To meet these requirements, you can enclose the Python code in triple backticks.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(ints_list):\n    divisible_ints = []\n    for i in range(31, 73):\n        if ints_list[i] % -63 == 0:\n            divisible_ints.append(ints_list[i])\n    return divisible_ints\n```\n\n7. Verify the solution: To verify that the Python code meets the specified requirements, you can create a list of integers and check that the function returns the expected list of integers divisible by -63 from index 31 to index 72, both inclusive.
