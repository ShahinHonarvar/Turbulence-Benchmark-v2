The range is defined as the integers from index 20 to index 20, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's how you can write the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(ints_list):\n    return [num for idx, num in enumerate(ints_list) if idx >= 20 and idx <= 20 and num % 2 == 0]\n```\n\nThe function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list of integers and check if the index of the integer is within the specified range and if it is divisible by 2. If both conditions are met, the integer is added to the resulting list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730519768, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=215, prompt_tokens=154, total_tokens=369))
