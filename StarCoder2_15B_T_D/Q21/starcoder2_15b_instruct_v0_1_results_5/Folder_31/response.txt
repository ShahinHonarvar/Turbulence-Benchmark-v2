Understand the problem specification: The problem requires us to write a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all integers divisible by -14 from index 66 to index 74, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\n2. Define the function: The function should be defined using `def` keyword in Python. It should take one argument, a list of integers, and return a list of integers.\n\n3. Check divisibility: To check if an integer is divisible by -14, we can use the modulo operator (`%`) to see if the remainder is 0. We can use the `if` statement to check if the remainder is 0.\n\n4. Iterate over the list: To iterate over the list, we can use a `for` loop to go through each element of the list.\n\n5. Add divisible integers to a new list: We can use the `append` method to add the divisible integers to a new list.\n\n6. Return the new list: We can use the `return` statement to return the new list containing all the divisible integers.\n\nHere's how you can write the function in Python code using the above steps:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    divisible_ints = []\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if num % -14 == 0 and 66 <= i <= 74:\n            divisible_ints.append(num)\n    return divisible_ints\n```\n\nThe function `all_ints_div_by_num` takes a list of integers as an argument. It checks if each integer is divisible by -14 and if its index is within the specified range. If both conditions are met, the integer is appended to a new list `divisible_ints`. Finally, the function returns the new list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730521094, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=446, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=601))
