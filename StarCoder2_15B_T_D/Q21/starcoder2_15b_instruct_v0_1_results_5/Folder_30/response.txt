Extract the key information from the text specification. In this case, you are asked to create a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all integers divisible by -82 from index 59 to index 79, both inclusive.\n2. Determine the expected behavior of the function based on the text specification. In this case, if no integers are divisible by -82 in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n3. Write the Python code to implement the function.\n4. Ensure that the code conforms to the specified format. In this case, the Python code should not contain any comments and should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(ints_list):\n    divisible_ints = []\n    for i in range(59, 80):\n        if ints_list[i] % -82 == 0:\n            divisible_ints.append(ints_list[i])\n    return divisible_ints\n```\n\nThis code implements the function `all_ints_div_by_num` as per the text specification. The function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all integers divisible by -82 from index 59 to index 79, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730521074, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=352, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=507))
