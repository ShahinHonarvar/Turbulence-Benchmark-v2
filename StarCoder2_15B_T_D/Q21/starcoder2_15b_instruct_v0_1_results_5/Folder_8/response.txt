ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="Based on the instruction, I understand that you want to write a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all integers divisible by -83 from index 34 to 55, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function using Python's list comprehension:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for i, num in enumerate(nums) if i >= 34 and i <= 55 and num % -83 == 0]\n```\n\nThe function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list of integers, `nums`. It checks if the index of the current integer is between 34 and 55, inclusive, and if the integer is divisible by -83. If both conditions are met, the integer is added to the resulting list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730520921, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=219, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=374))
