The text specification tells us that we need to write a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -19 from index 12 to index 77, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nHere's the code that follows the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(lst):\n    return [x for x in lst[12:78] if x % -19 == 0]\n```\n\nThe code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a single argument, `lst`, which is assumed to be a list of integers. The function uses list comprehension to filter the list and return a new list containing only the elements that are divisible by -19. The range of indices to consider is specified by `lst[12:78]`, which corresponds to the indices from 12 to 77, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730519924, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=270, prompt_tokens=155, total_tokens=425))
