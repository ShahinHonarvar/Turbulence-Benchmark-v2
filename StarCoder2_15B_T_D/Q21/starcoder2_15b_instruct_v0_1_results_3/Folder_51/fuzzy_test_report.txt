Out of 3 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 2 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-363, -377, 81, -477, -116, -35, -204, 189]


The correct answer was:

[-204]

But the LLM code returned:
[]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

[-217, -26, 283, 312, -266, -88, -105, 12]
