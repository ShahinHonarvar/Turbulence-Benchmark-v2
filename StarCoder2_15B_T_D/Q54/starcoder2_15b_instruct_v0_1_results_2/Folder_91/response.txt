The requirement states that you need to create a function called `all_right_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument. The function should return a sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than the first element of the tuple. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there are no such right-truncatable prime numbers, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.\n\nHere's how you could create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(numbers):\n    x = numbers[0]\n    right_truncatable_primes = []\n    for i in range(2, x):\n        is_right_truncatable_prime = True\n        for j in range(len(str(i)) - 1):\n            truncated_number = int(str(i)[:-j - 1])\n            if not is_prime(truncated_number):\n                is_right_truncatable_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_right_truncatable_prime:\n            right_truncatable_primes.append(i)\n    right_truncatable_primes.sort(reverse=True)\n    return right_truncatable_primes\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThe `all_right_truncatable_prime` function takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument. It iterates through all numbers from 2 to the first element of the tuple. For each number, it checks if it is a right-truncatable prime by truncating the last digit and checking if the truncated number is also prime. If the number is a right-truncatable prime, it is added to the `right_truncatable_primes` list. The list is then sorted in descending order and returned.\n\nThe `is_prime` function is a helper function that checks if a given number is prime. It iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number and checks if the number is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730657313, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=545, prompt_tokens=195, total_tokens=740))
