ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To create Python code based on the given text specification, we need to understand the requirements. The specification states that we need to write a function called `all_right_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument. The function should return a sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than the integer at index 77. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there are no such right-truncatable prime numbers, the function should return an empty list.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the `all_right_truncatable_prime` function to generate all right-truncatable prime numbers less than the given integer, and then sort them in descending order. We can use a loop to iterate over the integers in the tuple, check if they are prime numbers, and then remove the rightmost digit and check if the resulting number is still prime. We can use a list to store the right-truncatable prime numbers, and then sort the list in descending order before returning it.\n\n```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(numbers):\n    right_truncatable_primes = []\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number < 10:\n            continue\n        while number > 10:\n            if not is_prime(number):\n                break\n            number //= 10\n        if is_prime(number):\n            right_truncatable_primes.append(number)\n    return sorted(right_truncatable_primes, reverse=True)\n\n\ndef is_prime(number):\n    if number <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):\n        if number % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThe `all_right_truncatable_prime` function takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument and returns a sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than the integer at index 77. It iterates over the integers in the tuple, checks if they are prime numbers, and then removes the rightmost digit and checks if the resulting number is still prime. It stores the right-truncatable prime numbers in a list and sorts the list in descending order before returning it.\n\nThe `is_prime` function checks if a number is a prime number by iterating over the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730653712, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=538, prompt_tokens=196, total_tokens=734))
