Parse the text specification: In this case, you are given a function called `all_ints_exclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 86 to index 89, both exclusive.\n2. Generate Python code: Based on the text specification, you would create the function `all_ints_exclusive` in Python that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all elements from index 86 to index 89, both exclusive.\n3. Remove comments: Since the text specification does not contain any comments, you would not add any comments to the Python code.\n4. Delimit Python code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere is the Python code that would be generated based on the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_exclusive(ints):\n    return ints[86:89]\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730464814, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=220, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=347))
