ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can use Python\'s built-in list slicing syntax. The list slicing syntax allows us to extract a subset of a list based on the start index and end index. In this case, we want to extract all elements from index 22 to index 24, both exclusive. This means that we want to exclude the elements at index 22 and 24 from the resulting subset.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n```python\ndef all_ints_exclusive(ints):\n    """\n    Returns the list of all elements from index 22 to index 24, both exclusive.\n    """\n    return ints[22:24]\n```\n\nThe `all_ints_exclusive` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a subset of the list from index 22 to index 24, both exclusive. The list slicing syntax `ints[22:24]` is used to extract this subset from the input list.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730464907, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=215, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=342))
