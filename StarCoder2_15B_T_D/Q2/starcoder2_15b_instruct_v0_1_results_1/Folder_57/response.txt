Analyze the text specification: In this case, it says to create a function called `all_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all elements from index 43 to index 99, both exclusive.\n2. Break down the specification into smaller parts: The function takes a list of integers as an argument, so we'll need to define a parameter for that. The function should return a list of all elements from index 43 to index 99, both exclusive, so we'll need to slice the list accordingly.\n3. Write the code: Define a function called `all_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument. Slice the list to return all elements from index 43 to index 99, both exclusive.\n4. Delimit the code: Enclose the code in triple backticks to indicate the start and end of the Python code.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_exclusive(ints):\n    return ints[43:99]\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all elements from index 43 to index 99, both exclusive.
