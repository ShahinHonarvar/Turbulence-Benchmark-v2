The slice notation in Python uses the format [start:stop:step], where start is the index of the first element to include in the slice, stop is the index of the first element to exclude from the slice, and step is the step size used to select elements from the list. In this case, start is 13, stop is 70, and step is 1 (the default value), which means that all elements from index 13 to index 70, both exclusive, will be included in the slice.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730464608, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=174, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=301))
