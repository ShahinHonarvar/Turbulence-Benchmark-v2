Define a function called "all_ints_exclusive" that takes in a single argument "ints", which should be a list of integers.\n2. Within the function, use slicing to extract the elements from index 36 to index 54, both exclusive, from the "ints" list.\n3. Return the sliced list as the result of the function.\n\nHere\'s how you could write the function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_exclusive(ints):\n    return ints[36:54]\n```\n\nThis function uses slicing to extract the elements from index 36 to index 54, both exclusive, from the "ints" list. The function then returns the sliced list as the result.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730465246, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=221, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=348))
