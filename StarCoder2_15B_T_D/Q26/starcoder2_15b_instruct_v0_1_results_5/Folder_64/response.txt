Define a function called `sum_in_range` with one argument, `nums`, which is a list of integers.\n2. Create a variable called `total` and set it to 0. This variable will keep track of the sum of the integers between -3 and 6.\n3. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of `nums`.\n4. Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the current element is between -3 and 6, both inclusive.\n5. If the element is between -3 and 6, add it to `total`.\n6. After the loop, return `total`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(nums):\n    total = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if -3 <= num <= 6:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the elements of the given list and checks if they are between -3 and 6, both inclusive. If an element is in the range, it is added to the `total` variable. At the end, `total` is returned.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730536198, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=296, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=442))
