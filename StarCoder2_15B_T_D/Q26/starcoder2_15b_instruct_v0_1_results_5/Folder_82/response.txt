If the list does not contain any integers in this range, the `sum` function will return 0, as expected.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730536304, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=179, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=325))
