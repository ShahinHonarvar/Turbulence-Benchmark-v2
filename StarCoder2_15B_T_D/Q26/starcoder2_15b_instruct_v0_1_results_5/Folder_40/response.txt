This is achieved using a list comprehension that filters the integers in the range and then passing the filtered list to the `sum` function.\n- `if the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.` This is already handled by the code, as the `sum` function will return 0 if the filtered list is empty.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730536065, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=216, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=362))
