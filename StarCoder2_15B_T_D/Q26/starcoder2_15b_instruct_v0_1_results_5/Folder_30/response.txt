In this case, the specification states that we need to create a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all integers in the list that are between 86 and 90, both inclusive. If the list does not contain any integers in this range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere's how we can create the Python code based on this specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if 86 <= num <= 90:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730535999, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=155, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=303))
