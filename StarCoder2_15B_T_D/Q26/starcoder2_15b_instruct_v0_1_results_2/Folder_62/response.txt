Create an empty list to store the integers that are between -28 and 573.\n2. Loop through the given list of integers.\n3. For each integer, check if it is between -28 and 573 (inclusive) using the `range` function.\n4. If the integer is in the range, append it to the list created in step 1.\n5. After looping through the given list, sum up all the integers in the list created in step 1 and return the result.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    sum = 0\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number in range(-28, 574):\n            sum += number\n    return sum\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730534701, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=218, prompt_tokens=149, total_tokens=367))
