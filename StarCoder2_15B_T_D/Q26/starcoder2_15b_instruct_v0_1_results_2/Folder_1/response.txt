Parse the text specification: The text specification is surrounded by angle brackets. We need to remove the angle brackets and parse the text to understand the requirement.\n2. Create Python code: Based on the requirement, we can create a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all integers from the list that are between -97 and -48, both inclusive. If the list does not contain any integers in this range, the function should return 0.\n3. Generate Python code: Using the Python code we have created, we can generate the corresponding Python code without any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n\nHere is the implementation of the Python code generation function:\n\n```python\nimport ast\n\ndef generate_python_code(text_specification: str) -> str:\n    """\n    Generates Python code based on the given text specification.\n    """\n    text_specification = text_specification.strip(\'<>\')\n    tree = ast.parse(text_specification)\n    code_object = compile(tree, \'<string>\', \'exec\')\n    code = dis.Bytecode(code_object).dis()\n    python_code = f"""```python\n{code}\n```"""\n\n    return python_code\n```', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730534384, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=296, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=444))
