The text specification states that we need to create a function called `sum_in_range` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 38 and 81, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.\n\nHere's how you can create the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    return sum(num for num in numbers if 38 <= num <= 81)\n```\n\nThe Python code is delimited by triple backticks, as specified in the text specification. It consists of a function definition that takes one argument, `numbers`, which is a list of integers.
