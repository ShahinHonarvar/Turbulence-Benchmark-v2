ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, we can define a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function should return the sum of all integers from the list that are between -28 and 573, both inclusive. If the list does not contain any integers in this range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `sum_in_range` function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for num in lst:\n        if -28 <= num <= 573:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The `for` loop iterates over each element in the list.\n- The `if` statement checks if the element is between -28 and 573, both inclusive.\n- If the element is in the range, it is added to the `total` variable.\n- Finally, the `total` variable is returned as the result of the function.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730534186, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=224, prompt_tokens=149, total_tokens=373))
