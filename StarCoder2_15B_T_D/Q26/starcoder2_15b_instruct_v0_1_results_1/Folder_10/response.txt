Extract the text specification: Extract the text specification from the given text using regular expressions. In this case, the text specification is "a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 73 and 84, both inclusive".\n2. Create the function signature: Based on the text specification, the function should take one argument, a list of integers, and return the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 73 and 84, both inclusive. The function signature should be `def sum_in_range(numbers):`.\n3. Implement the function body: Use a for loop to iterate through the given list of integers and check if each integer is between 73 and 84, both inclusive. If so, add it to the sum. If not, skip to the next integer.\n4. Return the sum: After iterating through the entire list, return the sum of all integers in the specified range.\n5. Test the function: Test the function with a sample input to verify that it works correctly.\n\nHere\'s the Python code that implements the function\'sum_in_range\' according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    sum_in_range = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if 73 <= num <= 84:\n            sum_in_range += num\n    return sum_in_range\n```\n\nThe function\'sum_in_range\' takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 73 and 84, both inclusive. It iterates through the given list of integers and checks if each integer is in the specified range. If so, it adds it to the sum. If not, it skips to the next integer. Finally, it returns the sum of all integers in the specified range.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730533931, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=440, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=588))
