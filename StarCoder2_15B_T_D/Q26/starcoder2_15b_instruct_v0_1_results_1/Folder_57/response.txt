The function'sum_in_range' takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all integers from the list that are between 57 and 84, both inclusive. If the list does not contain any integers in that range, the function should return 0.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the function'sum_in_range' in Python:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for number in numbers:\n        if 57 <= number <= 84:\n            total += number\n    return total\n```\n\nThe function'sum_in_range' takes a list of integers as an argument and iterates over each integer in the list. If the integer is between 57 and 84, both inclusive, it is added to the running total. After the iteration, the function returns the running total. If the list does not contain any integers in the specified range, the function will return 0.", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730534163, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=224, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=372))
