ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='To solve this problem, you can create a Python function called `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function should iterate through the list and check each integer to see if it is between 46 and 91, both inclusive. If it is, the integer is added to a running total. If not, the integer is ignored. Once all integers have been checked, the function returns the running total.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if 46 <= num <= 91:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```\n\nThis implementation iterates through the given list of integers and checks each integer to see if it is between 46 and 91, both inclusive. If it is, the integer is added to a running total. If not, the integer is ignored. Once all integers have been checked, the function returns the running total.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730534241, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=219, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=367))
