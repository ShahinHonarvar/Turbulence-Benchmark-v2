If the list does not contain any integers in this range, the function should return 0.\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if 86 <= num <= 90:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the list and a conditional statement to check if the current element is in the desired range. If it is, it is added to the total sum. If not, the loop continues to the next element. After the loop, the total sum is returned.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730535558, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=180, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=328))
