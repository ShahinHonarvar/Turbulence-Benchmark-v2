Extract the function name,\'sum_in_range\', from the text specification.\n2. Extract the argument name, \'nums\', and the data type, \'list of integers\', from the text specification.\n3. Extract the return value,\'sum of all integers from the given list that are between 7 and 8, both inclusive\', from the text specification.\n4. Extract the edge case, \'If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.\', from the text specification.\n5. Write the Python code using the extracted information.\n6. Delimit the Python code with triple backticks.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the function\'sum_in_range\' according to the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(nums):\n    """\n    Returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 7 and 8, both inclusive.\n    If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.\n    """\n    return sum(num for num in nums if 7 <= num <= 8)\n```\n\nThe Python code uses a list comprehension to filter the integers between 7 and 8, both inclusive, from the given list. The\'sum\' function is then used to calculate the sum of the filtered integers. If the given list does not contain any integers between 7 and 8, the function returns 0.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730535503, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=327, prompt_tokens=146, total_tokens=473))
