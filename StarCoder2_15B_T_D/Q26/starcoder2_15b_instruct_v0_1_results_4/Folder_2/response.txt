Extract the text specification: Extract the text specification surrounded by angle brackets. In this case, we want to extract the text "Write a function called\'sum_in_range\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 266 and 586, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0."\n2. Parse the text specification: Parse the extracted text specification to identify the function name, parameters, and functionality.\n3. Generate Python code: Generate Python code based on the parsed text specification. In this case, we want to create a function called `sum_in_range` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 266 and 586, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.\n4. Remove comments: Remove any comments from the generated Python code. In this case, there are no comments.\n5. Delimit Python code: Delimit the generated Python code using triple backticks.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the Python code according to the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for number in numbers:\n        if 266 <= number <= 586:\n            total += number\n    return total\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a function called `sum_in_range` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function iterates through the list and checks if each integer is between 266 and 586, both inclusive. If it is, it adds it to the `total` variable. If the list does not contain any integers in the specified range, the function returns 0.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730535411, model='/repository', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='2.3.1-sha-a094729', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=420, prompt_tokens=150, total_tokens=570))
