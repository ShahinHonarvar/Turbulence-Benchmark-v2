ChatCompletion(id='', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="To create Python code from the given text specification, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Parse the text specification: The text specification provides a function name, argument name, and a range of values. In this case, the function name is `sum_in_range`, the argument name is `lst`, and the range of values is between -33 and 93, both inclusive.\n\n2. Generate the Python code: Since the text specification is simple, we can generate the corresponding Python code directly. Here is the Python code that implements the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(lst):\n    return sum(x for x in lst if -33 <= x <= 93)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function named `sum_in_range` that takes a single argument `lst`. It returns the sum of all elements in `lst` that are between -33 and 93, both inclusive.\n\n3. Delimit the Python code: The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. This indicates the start and end of the Python code block.\n\nHere's how you can create Python code from the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(lst):\n    return sum(x for x in lst if -33 <= x <= 93)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function named `sum_in_range` that takes a single argument `lst`.
