It does this by creating an empty set called `original_set` and then updating it with each of the input sets. This ensures that the final set contains all the elements from all the input sets, and is therefore the smallest set that contains all the input sets as subsets.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730264875, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=297, prompt_tokens=110, total_tokens=407), provider='Together')
