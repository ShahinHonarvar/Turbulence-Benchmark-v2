It uses recursion and the principle of combinatorics to achieve this. The function first checks if the length of the elements is less than 25, in which case it returns 0. If the length of the elements is exactly 25, it returns 1, as there is only one subset of size 25 that can be formed from a set of 25 elements. In all other cases, the function calculates the number of subsets of size 25 by recursively calling itself on the tail of the elements and multiplying the result by the number of elements that can be added to the subset while keeping its size at 25.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730268930, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=213, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=311), provider='Together')
