It assumes that the input set is not empty and that the elements in the set are unique. If the input set is empty or has less than 22 elements, the function returns 0. If the input set has exactly 22 elements, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function returns the sum of the number of subsets of size 22 that can be formed by including the first element and the number of subsets of size 22 that can be formed by excluding the first element. This is because any subset of size 22 can either include or exclude the first element. The function continues this process until it has considered all possible subsets of size 22.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730269745, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=215, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=313), provider='Together')
