It uses recursion and the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the result. The function first checks if the length of the set is less than 60, in which case it returns 0. If the length of the set is exactly 60, it returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of subsets of size 60 by adding the number of subsets of size 60 that include the first element to the number of subsets of size 60 that do not include the first element. The number of subsets of size 60 that include the first element is equal to the number of subsets of size 59 in the rest of the set, and the number of subsets of size 60 that do not include the first element is equal to the number of subsets of size 60 in the rest of the set. The function multiplies these two numbers by (len(elements) - 59) to account for the different ways the first element can be included or excluded.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730269184, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=282, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=380), provider='Together')
