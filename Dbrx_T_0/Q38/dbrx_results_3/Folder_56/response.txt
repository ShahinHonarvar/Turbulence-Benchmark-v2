It uses recursion and the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the result. The base cases are when the length of the set is less than 60, in which case the result is 0, and when the length of the set is exactly 60, in which case the result is 1. In the recursive case, the function calculates the number of subsets of size 60 that include the first element, and the number of subsets of size 60 that do not include the first element, and adds them together. The number of subsets of size 60 that include the first element is equal to the number of subsets of size 59 in the rest of the set, which is calculated recursively. The number of subsets of size 60 that do not include the first element is equal to the number of subsets of size 60 in the rest of the set, which is also calculated recursively. The function multiplies these two numbers together to get the total number of subsets of size 60 that include the first element, and then adds this to the number of subsets of size 60 that do not include the first element. The function continues this process until it has considered all the elements in the set.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730269384, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=329, prompt_tokens=98, total_tokens=427), provider='Together')
