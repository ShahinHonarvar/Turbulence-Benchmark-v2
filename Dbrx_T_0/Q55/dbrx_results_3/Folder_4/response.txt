The function uses a helper function `sublists_with_product_equal_n` which takes a list and a number as arguments and returns a generator of sublists of the given list with the product of their elements equal to the given number. The helper function uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible sublists of the given list and checks if the product of their elements is equal to the given number. If the product is equal to the given number, the sublist is yielded. The `lists_with_product_equal_n` function then uses the helper function to find all sublists with product equal to 91 in the given list and in the circular list. The result is then converted to a list and duplicates are removed using the `set` data structure. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730289341, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=368, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=576), provider='Together')
