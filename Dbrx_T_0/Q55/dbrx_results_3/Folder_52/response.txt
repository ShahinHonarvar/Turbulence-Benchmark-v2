It does this by iterating over all possible sublist lengths and starting indices, and checking if the product of the sublist elements equals `n`. If the sublist is empty and `n` is 1, it yields an empty sublist. If the first element of the sublist is 1 and `n` is 1, it yields the sublist. If the first element of the sublist is divisible by `n` and all other elements are divisible by `n`, it recursively generates sublists of the remaining elements and yields the current sublist prepended to each of those sublists.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` then uses the helper function to generate all sublists of the input list `lst` whose product equals 37, and returns a list of sorted tuples of those sublists. It uses a set to remove duplicates and converts the resulting set to a list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter because sets do not maintain order.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730289548, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=420, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=628), provider='Together')
