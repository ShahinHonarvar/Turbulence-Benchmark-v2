It does this by iterating over all possible sublists of the input list and checking if their product is equal to `n`.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists of the input list that have a product equal to 57. It does this by calling the helper function with the input list and 57 as arguments, and passing the input list as a cycle to the helper function.\n\nNote: The `reduce` function used in the helper function is a function from the `functools` module, which applies a given function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single output. In this case, it is used to calculate the product of all elements in a sublist.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730290512, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=338, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=546), provider='Together')
