It does this by iterating over all possible sublists of the input list and checking if their product is equal to `n`.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` then uses this helper function to find all sublists of the input list that have a product equal to -91. It also checks for sublists in a circular version of the input list, where the head and the tail are adjacent to each other.\n\nThe `product` function is used to calculate the product of all elements in a list, and the `reduce` function is used to apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single output.\n\nThe `islice` function is used to get a slice of the input list, starting from the first element and ending at the last element, and the `cycle` function is used to create a circular version of the input list.\n\nThe `+` operator is used to concatenate the two lists of sublists returned by the helper function, so that the final list contains all sublists with a product equal to -91, both in the original list and in the circular version of the list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730290531, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=434, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=642), provider='Together')
