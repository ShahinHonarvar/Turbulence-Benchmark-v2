It does this by iterating over all possible sublists of the input list and checking if their product is equal to `n`. If it is, the sublist is added to the result list.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists that have a product equal to 33. It does this by calling the helper function with the input list and 33 as arguments. The input list is first converted to a circular list by using the `cycle` function from the `itertools` module.\n\nThe `prod` function is used to calculate the product of a list of integers.\n\nThe order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.\n\nIf no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list.\n\nIf there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730290418, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=400, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=608), provider='Together')
