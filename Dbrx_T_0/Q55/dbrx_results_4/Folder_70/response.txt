It does this by iterating over all possible sublists of the given list and checking if their product is equal to `n`.\n\nThe `product` function is another helper function that calculates the product of all elements in a list.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` first calls `sublists_with_product_equal_n` with the given list and `32` as the target product. Then it calls `sublists_with_product_equal_n` again with a circular version of the given list (i.e. the list with its first element removed and appended to the end) and `32` as the target product. The results of both calls are concatenated and returned.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the input list does not contain zero, as the product of any sublist containing zero would be zero, which is not equal to the target product of `32`. If the input list can contain zero, the solution would need to be modified to handle this case.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730290037, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=381, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=589), provider='Together')
