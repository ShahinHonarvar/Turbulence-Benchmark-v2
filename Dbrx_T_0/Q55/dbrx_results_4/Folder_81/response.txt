It does this by iterating over all possible sublists of the given list and checking if their product equals `n`.\n\nThe `product` function is another helper function that calculates the product of all elements in a list.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` first calls `sublists_with_product_equal_n` with the given list and `-8` as arguments. Then it calls `sublists_with_product_equal_n` again with a circular version of the given list (i.e., the list with its head and tail connected) and `-8` as arguments. The results of these two calls are concatenated and returned.\n\nNote that the order of sublists in the returned list does not matter, so the function does not guarantee any specific order of sublists in the returned list. Also, if there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730290082, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=364, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=572), provider='Together')
