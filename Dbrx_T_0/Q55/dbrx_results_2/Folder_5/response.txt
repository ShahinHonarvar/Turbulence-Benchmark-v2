The helper function uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible sublists of the given list and checks if their product equals `n`. If it does, the sublist is added to the result list.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` then uses the helper function to find all sublists with a product equal to `-33` and returns them. The function also checks if the first element of the sublist is non-zero and if all elements of the sublist are non-zero before checking if their product equals `n`. This is to avoid sublists that contain a zero or a negative number when the target product is negative.\n\nThe function also checks if the first element of the sublist is equal to `-n` and if all other elements of the sublist are positive, or if the first element of the sublist is equal to `n` and if all other elements of the sublist are negative. This is to handle the case where the target product is negative and the sublist contains a single negative number.\n\nFinally, the function checks if the first element of the sublist is non-zero and if all elements of the sublist are non-zero before checking if their product equals `n`. This is to avoid sublists that contain a zero or a negative number when the target product is positive.\n\nThe function uses a list comprehension to filter out any sublists that contain a zero or a negative number when the target product is positive.\n\nThe function uses the `cycle` function from the `itertools` module to create a circular list from the given list. The `islice` function is used to iterate over the circular list in a circular manner.\n\nThe function returns a list of sublists that have a product equal to `-33`. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730288934, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=741, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=949), provider='Together')
