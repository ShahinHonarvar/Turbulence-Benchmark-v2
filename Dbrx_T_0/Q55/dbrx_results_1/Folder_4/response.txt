It then uses this helper function to generate all such sublists for the input list and its circular version, and returns the union of these two sets as a list.\n\nThe `sublists_with_product_equal_n` function uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible sublists of the input list. For each sublist, it checks if the product of its elements is equal to `n`. If it is, the sublist is yielded. If `n` is 1 and the sublist is empty or contains only 1s, it is also yielded.\n\nThe `lists_with_product_equal_n` function first generates all such sublists for the input list, and then for its circular version. It then takes the union of these two sets and converts it to a list. The `set` data structure is used to remove any duplicates from the union.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input list contains only positive integers. If the input list can contain negative integers or zero, the function will need to be modified accordingly.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730288502, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=400, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=608), provider='Together')
