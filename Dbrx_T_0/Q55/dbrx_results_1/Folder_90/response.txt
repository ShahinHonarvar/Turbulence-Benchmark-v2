It then uses this helper function to generate all sublists of the input list with a product of -690, and returns a list of these sublists.\n\nThe helper function uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible sublists of `lst`. The outer loop iterates over the length of the sublists, and the inner loop iterates over the starting indices of the sublists. For each sublist, the function checks if the product of its elements is equal to `n`. If `n` is 1 or -1, the function checks if the sublist is [1] or [-1], respectively. If `n` is not 1 or -1, the function checks if `n` is a multiple of the product of the sublist's elements. If so, the function yields the sublist.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` uses the helper function to generate all sublists of the input list with a product of -690, and returns a list of these sublists. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they are all contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730288876, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=456, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=664), provider='Together')
