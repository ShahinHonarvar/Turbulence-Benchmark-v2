It does this by iterating over all possible sublists of the input list and checking if their product is equal to `n`.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` then uses this helper function to find all sublists of the input list with a product equal to 37. It does this by iterating over all possible rotations of the input list and finding all sublists with a product equal to 37 for each rotation. The resulting sublists are then converted to a set to remove any duplicates, and then converted back to a list before being returned.\n\nNote that this function uses the `prod` function to calculate the product of a list of numbers. This function is defined as a helper function inside the main function.\n\nAlso, this function uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicates, and then converts it back to a list before being returned.\n\nFinally, this function uses the `cycle` function from the `itertools` module to create a circular list from the input list. This is done by creating a generator that yields the elements of the input list in a circular manner. The `islice` function is then used to get the first `len(lst)` elements from this generator, effectively creating a circular list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730288720, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=476, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=684), provider='Together')
