It does this by iterating over all possible sublists of the given list and checking if their product equals `n`.\n\nThe `product` function is another helper function that calculates the product of all elements in a list.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` first calls `sublists_with_product_equal_n` with the given list and `n=5` to find all sublists of the given list whose product equals 5. It then calls `sublists_with_product_equal_n` again with a circular version of the given list (i.e., the head and the tail are adjacent to each other) and `n=5` to find all sublists of the circular list whose product equals 5. The results of these two calls are then concatenated and returned.\n\nNote that the order of sublists in the returned list does not matter, so the function does not guarantee any particular order of sublists in the returned list. Also, if there are duplicates of such a sublist, they will all be contained in the returned list.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730288886, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=395, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=603), provider='Together')
