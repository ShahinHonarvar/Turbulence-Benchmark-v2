It does this by iterating over all possible sublists of the given list and checking if their product equals `n`.\n\nThe `product` function is another helper function that calculates the product of all elements in a list.\n\nThe main function `lists_with_product_equal_n` first calls `sublists_with_product_equal_n` with the given list and `n=4` to find all sublists of the given list whose product equals 4. It then calls `sublists_with_product_equal_n` again with a circular version of the given list (i.e., a list where the head and the tail are adjacent to each other) and `n=4` to find all sublists of the circular list whose product equals 4. The results of these two calls are then concatenated and returned.\n\nNote that this function handles the case where the given list is empty or contains only zeros by returning an empty list in those cases. It also handles the case where the given list contains negative numbers or non-integer numbers by treating them as if they were integers (i.e., by taking their absolute value and rounding them to the nearest integer, respectively).', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730288583, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=415, prompt_tokens=208, total_tokens=623), provider='Together')
