Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758]


The correct answer was:

[2, 3, 5, 7, 23, 29, 31, 37, 53, 59, 71, 73, 79, 233, 239, 293, 311, 313, 317, 373, 379]

But the LLM code returned:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 23, 37, 53, 73, 223, 227, 233, 257, 277, 337, 353, 373]
