It uses a generator expression to filter out characters in the given string based on the specified conditions. The `join` method is then used to combine the remaining characters into a single string. The function checks if the index of the character is between 63 and 89 (exclusive), and if the character is greater than '*' and smaller than 'w'. If the character does not meet these conditions, it is included in the new string. The function also checks if the index of the character is less than 63 or greater than or equal to 89, in which case the character is also included in the new string. This ensures that the order of all characters in the string is kept intact.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730267523, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=214, prompt_tokens=147, total_tokens=361), provider='Together')
