The function first initializes a set of English letters and an empty set to store the palindromes. It then iterates over all possible substrings of the input string that occur between index 0 to index 8, both inclusive. For each substring, it checks if the length of the substring is at least 7 and if all the characters in the substring are English letters. If both conditions are satisfied, it adds the sorted version of the substring to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.\n\nNote: The function uses the `sorted` function to sort the characters in the substring before adding it to the set of palindromes. This is because the problem statement specifies that the function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner, and sorting the characters ensures that the same palindrome is not added to the set multiple times with different case variations.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730276534, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=339, prompt_tokens=197, total_tokens=536), provider='Together')
