It first initializes a dictionary, `char_count`, to keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the string. It then iterates through the string, updating the count of each character in the dictionary. If the character is within the specified range, it only updates the count if the character has not been seen before. After that, it initializes an empty string, `result`, and iterates through the string again. If the character is within the specified range and its count is 1, it adds the character to the `result` string. If the character is not within the specified range, it adds the character to the `result` string if it has not been seen before. Finally, it returns the `result` string.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730267109, model='databricks/dbrx-instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=363, prompt_tokens=137, total_tokens=500), provider='Together')
