It does this by first creating a set of all characters in the given string that are within the specified range, then intersecting that set with a set of all characters between 'V' and 'o' (inclusive). It then iterates over this set of characters to remove, and for each character, it uses the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of that character from the string.
