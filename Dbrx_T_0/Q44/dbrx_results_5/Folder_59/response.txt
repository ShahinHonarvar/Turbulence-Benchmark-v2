If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty set. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the list of numbers and checks if each number is a composite number. If it is, the number is added to the composite_numbers set. The function uses the fact that a composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime, and a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. The function checks if a number is composite by checking if it is not divisible by 2 or 3 and if it is not a prime number. The function uses the fact that a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is not divisible by any positive integer other than 1 and itself. The function uses the fact that a composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime, and a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
