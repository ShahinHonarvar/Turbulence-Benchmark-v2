It takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the second largest number in the list. The specification of the problem may need more explanation. As it is written, the problem statement seems to imply that a sublist of the original list should be considered, from the 64th to the 66th index, but this is not clear. It would be more clarity on the problem statement that would be helpful in providing an exact solution.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730526330, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
