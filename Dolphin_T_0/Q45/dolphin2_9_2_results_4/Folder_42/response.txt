It then checks each arrangement to see if it's a palindrome and if so, it's added to a set. The generated palindromes are checked for their length which should be at least 3. If a palindrome of specified length cannot be created from the English letters in the given string, an empty set is returned. The palindromes are formed in a case-insensitive manner.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730579303, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
