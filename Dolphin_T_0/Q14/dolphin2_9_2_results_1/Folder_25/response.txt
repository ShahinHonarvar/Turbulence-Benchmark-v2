It first checks if the list has at least 76 elements, as the task requires considering elements from index 37 to 76. If it doesn't, the function returns None. If the length requirement is met, it extracts a subset of the list from index 37 to 76. If there are less than two distinct elements in this subset, it also returns None, because it means there is no second smallest element. If the subset contains at least two distinct elements, it sorts the subset and returns its second element, which is the second smallest one.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730527331, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
