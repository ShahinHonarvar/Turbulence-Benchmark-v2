It's not necessary to include both checks, unless you're looking for negative numbers that are also divisible by 115. As of February 2022, Python doesn't allow integers with more than a certain number of digits, and -115**200 is too long to be handled.\n\nAlso note that for a given integer to be divisible by both -115 and 115, it must be a multiple of |-115*115|, which is 115^2. Therefore, another possible solution is:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):\n    result = [i for i in range(30, 201) if i % 115**2 == 0]\n    return result\n```\nIn this representation, I used list comprehension to shorten the code.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730532671, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
