It uses list comprehension to iterate through the subset of the list from index 77 to 87 inclusive (recall that Python slicing for list indices is left-closed and right-open, so this is actually achieved with [77:88]). For each integer in this subset, we check whether it is divisible by both 23 and 57 (`num % 23 == 0 and num % 57 == 0`). If the condition is met, the number is added to the new list that will be returned. If no such number exist in the range, the function just returns an empty list, as required by the final condition in the problem specification.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730533265, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
