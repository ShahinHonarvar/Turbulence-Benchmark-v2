Then we should initialize an empty list `result` to store our answers. The `product` is a variable that we store the product of all number of the current sublist. We start with the first number of `lst` (that is `lst[0]`) and multiply it with the next numbers based on the length of `lst`. For each possible sublist, we need to make sure that its last number is not the same as the first number, in which case it could form a circle. If the product of its first number and last number is equal to 32, we check the product of all numbers in the current sublist. If the total product is equal to 32, we add the current sublist into the `result` list. We finally return the `result` list that should contain all the sublists from `lst` where the products of its numbers are equal to 32.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730609825, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
