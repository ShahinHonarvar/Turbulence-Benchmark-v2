If it is, this segment is appended to the result list. This search is done for each possible starting index to ensure that all possibilities are checked. If the product of the numbers in a certain segment is greater than 5, there is no need to continue examining longer segments starting with the same index, so the inner search is broken off. After all starting indices have been examined, the result list is returned.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730608322, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
