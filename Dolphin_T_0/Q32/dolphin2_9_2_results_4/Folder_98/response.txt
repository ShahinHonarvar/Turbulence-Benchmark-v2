For each character, if the preceding character is 'U', it opens a string with 'Uu' and append the current character; otherwise, it just uses the current character. The resultant characters are then joined to form a new string that is identical to the original input string, except that a 'u' character has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of 'U'.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730554318, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
