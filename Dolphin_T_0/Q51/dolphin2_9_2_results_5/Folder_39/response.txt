It also generates a set `sett` to keep incremental track of unique anagrams.\n\nThe function loops through all the words in the input list `lst`, and for each word, it computes its lower case and sorts its letters to get the anagram. Only words with anagrams of length three or more are considered (as specified in the problem). The sorted word is used as a key to increment the corresponding count in `cnt` and is also added to `sett`.\n\nTo check if there are at most 257 pairs of anagrams, it is enough to check if there are at most 257 different anagrams in `sett`. This is equivalent to checking if the size of `sett` is less than or equal to 257.\n\nHowever, the provided code, attempts to find the pairs by computing the list `ins` of counts of anagrams, and the list `outs` of twice those counts. For each count, it checks if it is present in `outs` and returns a list of booleans.\n\nThe final function, `if_contains_anagrams`, could be simplified by just checking the size of `sett` as in the commented line. The complicated and inefficient method with `ins` and `outs` doesn't seem to serve any purpose in the context of the problem.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730597797, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
