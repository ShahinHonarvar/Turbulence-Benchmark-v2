The function considers only the anagrams of English letters with a length of at least three and compares the strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nThe function maintains a count of the anagrams found and a set of the sorted lowercase versions of the words. It iterates over each word in the input list, checks if the length is less than three, and continues to the next word if it is. If the length is greater than or equal to three, it converts the word to lowercase, sorts its characters, and checks if the sorted version has been seen before. If it has been seen before, the count is incremented. If it hasn't been seen before, it is added to the set. Finally, the function returns `True` if the count is less than or equal to 289, and `False` otherwise.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730594990, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
