It works as follows:\n\n- If the size of the set is less than 94, it returns 0, since there are no subsets of size 94.\n- If the size of the set is equal to 94, it returns 1, as the set itself is the only subset of size 94.\n- Else, it removes one element from the set, calculates the number of subsets of size 94 in the remaining set, and multiplies it by the number of ways we can choose an element to remove from the initial set (which is equal to the size of the initial set). The final result is the number of subsets of size 94 in the initial set.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730565063, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
