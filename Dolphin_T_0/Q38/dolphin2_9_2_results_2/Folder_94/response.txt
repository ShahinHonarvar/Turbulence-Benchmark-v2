The first function takes a set as an input, determines all of its subsets with the size of 93, and returns the number of those subsets. The second function generates all possible subsets of a given set. This is done using a mathematical approach that leverages the property of binary numbers. Each subset is represented by a unique integer (or bit vector), which is generated by considering all integers from 0 to 2^n - 1 (n is the size of the set). Then each subset is generated by iterating through this integer and including the set element corresponding to every set bit in the integer.\n', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730565213, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
