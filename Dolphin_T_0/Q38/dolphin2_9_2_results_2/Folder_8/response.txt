If the size of the set is equal to 49, it returns 1, meaning there is only one subset of this size. If the set has more than 49 elements, the function removes one element, calls itself recursively, and multiplies the result by the size of the set. This is because the number of ways to form a subset of size n from a set of size m is nCm, which is m!/(n!(m-n)!). However, this method becomes inefficient for large sets and can be replaced with a different algorithm.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730565002, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
