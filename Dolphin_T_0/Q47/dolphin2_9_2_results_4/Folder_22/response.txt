It is made case-insensitive with the `.lower` method.\n- The string is also checked if it only consists of English alphabets.\n- If it fulfills all these conditions, it is added to the `result` set.\n- The function finally returns the result.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730584729, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
