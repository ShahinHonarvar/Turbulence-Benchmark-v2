It uses four nested loops to iterate through each possible submatrix of the input matrix, and checks if each submatrix contains exactly 74 integers. The variable 'count' keeps track of the number of submatrices found that meet this condition. \n\nThe function follows an approach of checking each submatrix starting from every element and including all its possible subsequent elements. It uses numpy to create submatrices and a nested loop to check all combinations. Lastly, it returns the number of found submatrices, or '0' if no such submatrix was found.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730616488, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
