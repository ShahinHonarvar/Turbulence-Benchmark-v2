It follows the provided text specification exactly, including the angle brackets:\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(my_list):\n    result = 0\n    for i in my_list:\n        if 7 <= i <= 9:\n            result += i\n    return result if result else 0\n```\nThe above function `sum_in_range` takes a list `my_list` as input. It then initializes a variable `result` as 0, which is eventually going to store the sum of all elements in the list that are within the range 7 to 9 (inclusive).\n\nThen, using a for loop, the function goes through each element `i` in the list. If `i` is between 7 and 9 inclusive, it adds `i` to `result`. Once it has gone through all the elements in the list, it returns `result`. If `result` is 0 (indicating that there were no elements within the range 7 to 9), the function will return 0.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730545182, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
