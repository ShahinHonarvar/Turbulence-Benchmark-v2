Then it uses a recursive function to calculate the greatest common factor (GCF, also known as GCD) of the two numbers. The GCF is calculated by using the Euclid algorithm: if one of the numbers is zero, the other number is the GCF. Otherwise, calculate the remainder of a division by the second number on the first number, and use this remainder along with the second number as the two numbers for the next recursion.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730549236, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
