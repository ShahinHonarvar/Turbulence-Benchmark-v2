It works by looping through all the numbers up to the smallest of the two and checking which are divisors for both numbers. If a number is a divisor for both, it is stored in the `gcf` variable, updating it if a larger divisor is found. At the end, the gcf is returned by the function.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730548754, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
