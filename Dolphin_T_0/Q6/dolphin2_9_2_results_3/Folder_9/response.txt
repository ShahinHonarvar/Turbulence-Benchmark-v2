The function `all_neg_ints_exclusive` takes in a list of integers, and returns a list made up of all the negative integers located between the 71st and 199th indices, in compliance with the 0-based indexing system. A list comprehension is used to iterate through all integers in the given list (`lst`), adding an integer to the new list if it is both negative and located between the necessary indices. If there are no integers that match both these criteria, an empty list is returned.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730517459, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
