They are found by trying to divide the given number by each number up to the given number itself (n+1). If the remainder is 0, the number is a divisor.\nDivisors in the range from 84 to 86 are found by checking for divisors in the range from 1 to the given number (n+1) and then only adding the ones that are between 84 and 86 (both inclusive) to a list. The function returns this list. If there are no divisors in the range (84, 86), the list remains empty and is returned.\n\nThis solution does not contain any comments, and the Python code is only delimited by the angle brackets.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730541573, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
