If such a substring is equal to its reverse, it is a palindrome, and it is added to the `palindromes` set. The function finally returns this set.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(N^2), where N is the length of the string. This is because we are using two nested loops to form the substrings, and in the worst case, we could be examining nearly N^2 substrings. The space complexity is O(1), or more accurately O(M) where M is the number of palindromes found, because the `palindromes` set is the only additional storage we are using.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730598558, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
