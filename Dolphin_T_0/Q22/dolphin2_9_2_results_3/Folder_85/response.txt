The generator starts at `n`, steps up by `n`, and ends at `28 * n` (since we want to include the 27th multiple). \n\nI then pass this generator to the built-in `sum` function, which will return the sum of these 27 multiples. The use of a generator expression results in a solution that is both concise and memory-efficient, as the sum can be computed incrementally without requiring all multiples to be stored in memory at once.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730540543, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
