It should return a list of those integers which are divisible by 85 and they are located at the index 70 and 71. The Python function 'all_ints_div_by_num' accomplishes this task by slicing the input list to get the elements at the indexes 70 and 71. Then it iterates through this sublist and checks if the integer is divisible by 85. If it is, it includes the integer in the result list 'divisible_by_85'. Finally, the function returns this list.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730539305, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
