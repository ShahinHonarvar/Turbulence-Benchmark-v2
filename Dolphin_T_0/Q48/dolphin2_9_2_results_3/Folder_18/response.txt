It first determines the integers \'a\' and \'b\' located at the 56th and 90th indices of the tuple. It then constructs a list of all integers that lie between \'a+1\' and \'b-1\' that are not contained in the tuple within indices 56 to 90. If this list is not empty, the function computes the sum of its elements and checks if this sum is odd. If the sum is odd, the binary representation of the sum is returned, excluding the \'0b\' prefix. If the sum is even, the hexadecimal representation of the sum is returned, excluding the \'0x\' prefix. If all integers from \'a+1\' to \'b-1\' inclusive are present in the specified range in the tuple, an empty string is returned.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730587299, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
