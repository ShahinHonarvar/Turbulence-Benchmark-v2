If it doesn't, the function returns an empty string, as this ensures that all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` are present in the tuple. It then calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not in the tuple, and checks if this sum is odd or even. If it's odd, the binary representation of the sum is returned (without the leading '0b'), and if it's even, the hexadecimal representation is returned (without the leading '0x').", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730588375, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
