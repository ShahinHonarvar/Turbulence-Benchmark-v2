If both these conditions are met, the character is added to the list. \n\nIf no character in the specified range meets these conditions, an empty list will be returned.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730556262, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
