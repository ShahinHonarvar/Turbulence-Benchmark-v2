A function named 'return_vowels' is declared that takes one argument, a string ('s').\n2. A list of vowels is declared as ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'].\n3. The function returns a list comprising of the specific characters in the string 's' from index 24 (inclusive) to index 59 (exclusive) that are vowels, greater than 'n' and smaller than or equal to 'u'.\n4. The '[c for c in s[24:59] if c in vowels and c > 'n' and c <= 'u']' is a list comprehension that iterates through the string 's' from index 24 to index 59, checks if the current character 'c' is a vowel and if it's greater than 'n' and smaller than or equal to 'u'. If these conditions are all met, the character 'c' is added to the list.\n5. If no such characters exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned by the function.\n6.
