The operation is accomplished by utilizing Python's list slicing feature along with the built-in 'max' function. The list slicing allows for the extraction of a specified range within the original list, and the 'max' function returns the greatest value within the extracted range. The indices are specified according to the zero-based indexing convention in Python, thus the end index is set to 99 instead of 98 to include the 98th element in the extracted range.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730523411, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
