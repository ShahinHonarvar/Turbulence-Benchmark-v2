If a factor is found, it adds that number to the set of composite numbers. This set is then returned by the function as the final output. If no composite number is found in the specified range, an empty set is returned.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730577174, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
