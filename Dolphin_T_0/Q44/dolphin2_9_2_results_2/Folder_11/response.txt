This function `composite_nums_between_indices` accepts a list of positive integers. It then derives a sub-list from index 37 to 76. In this sublist, it identifies numbers that are composite (i.e., they have more than two distinct positive divisors). If any composite numbers exist in the sublist, they are added to a set which is returned from the function. If no composite numbers are found, an empty set is returned.', refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730575947, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
