A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that doesn't contain the digit 0 and if its leftmost digit is removed, then all the resulting numbers are prime.\n\nHere, a python function, 'all_left_truncatable_prime', is generated which accepts a tuple and returns a list of left-truncatable prime numbers. The code is structured in the following way:\n\n- Defined an anonymous function 'is_prime' to check if a number is prime or not.\n- An empty list 'left_truncatable_prime' is initiated to store the left-truncatable primes.\n- Starts a loop that traverses each integer from 2 to 'x' (the integer at index 618 of the definitive tuple).\n- If the number is a prime number, the code will then initiate another loop:\n    - The new loop trims off the last digit of the original prime number and checks if the result is still a prime number.\n    - It keeps removing the digits from the left until it gets to zero or until it finds a number that is not a prime number.\n- The prime numbers are then stored in the 'left_truncatable_prime' list.\n- Finally, the list is sorted in ascending order as per the requirement and is returned.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730616676, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
