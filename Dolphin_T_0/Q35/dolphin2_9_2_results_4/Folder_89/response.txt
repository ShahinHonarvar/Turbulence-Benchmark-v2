Generally, indexing in Python starts from 0 and not 1. Therefore, the 55th index would be the 56th character as per 1-based index. Please confirm this, or else adjust the indices 55 and 84 accordingly if indexing starts from 1 in your use case.", refusal='', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1730561228, model='cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x22b', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, total_tokens=0), provider='Novita')
