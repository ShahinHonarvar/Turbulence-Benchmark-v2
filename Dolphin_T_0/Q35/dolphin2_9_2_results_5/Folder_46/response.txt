We iterate through the string from the 10th character to the 79th (both inclusive). For each character at these indices, we check if the same character appears before index 10 or after index 79 in the string. If it does, we add this character to the `chars_to_remove` set. At the end, we rebuild the string by only including the characters that are not in our set of characters to remove.
