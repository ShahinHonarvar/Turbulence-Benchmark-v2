Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['\'RA1Q*FX8[0D\' A[}-@G$@ XkT [{X<B,5b#P. aZ=zH=t7y{,UiH0^l5"']


The correct answer was:

[]

But the LLM code returned:
['\'RA1Q*FX8[0D\' A[}-@G$@ XkT [{X<B,5b#P. aZ=zH=t7y{,UiH0^l5"', 'RA1Q*FX8[0D\' A[}-@G$@ XkT [{X<B,5b#P. aZ=zH=t7y{,UiH0^l5"']
