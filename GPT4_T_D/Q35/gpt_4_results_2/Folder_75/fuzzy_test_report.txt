Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['B0  0H0z6F92q8&lKs8s  PRk3C=d&xUVB D$h97 +h=Y>2>S8Z2f=35 7e= h7%999*&2$8&>7Y15> 3r 7=Vc% 1 046 d']


The correct answer was:

B00H0z6F92q8&lKs8sPRk3Cd&xUVBD$97+Y2S8Z2f357e7%999*&2$8&7Y153r7Vc%1046d

But the LLM code returned:
B00H0z6F9q8lKs8sPRk3CdxUVBD$9+YS8Zf35e%999*$8Y153rVc%1046d
