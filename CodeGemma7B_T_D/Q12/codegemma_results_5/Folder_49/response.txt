  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the smallest element from index 80 to index 80, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\n```python\ndef find_smallest_num(num_list):\n  for i in range(80, 81):\n    min_num = float(\'inf\')\n    for j in range(i, 81):\n      if num_list[j] < min_num:\n        min_num = num_list[j]\n  return min_num\n```\n        System: The provided code is correct. It uses a nested loop to iterate over the specified range (80 to 80 inclusive) and finds the smallest number within that range. The code utilizes the `float(\'inf\')` representation of positive infinity to initialize `min_num` and ensures that the function returns the smallest number from the designated indices."
