  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the smallest element from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_smallest_num(num_list):\n    return min(num_list[90:201])\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the smallest element from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive. This is done using the min() function, which returns the smallest element in an iterable. The num_list[90:201] expression slices the list from index 90 to index 200, inclusive, and then passes that slice to the min() function. The result is then returned by the function."
