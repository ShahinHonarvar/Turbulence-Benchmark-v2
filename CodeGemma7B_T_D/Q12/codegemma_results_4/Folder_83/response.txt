  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the smallest element from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_smallest_num(nums):\n  min_num = float(\'inf\')\n  for i in range(90, 201):\n    if nums[i] < min_num:\n      min_num = nums[i]\n  return min_num\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `min_num` variable is initialized to a large value, `float(\'inf\')`. This ensures that any element in the list will be smaller.\n* The `for` loop iterates from index 90 to index 200 (inclusive).\n* For each index, we compare the element to `min_num` and update `min_num` if necessary.\n* Finally, the function returns `min_num`, which contains the smallest element in the specified range."
