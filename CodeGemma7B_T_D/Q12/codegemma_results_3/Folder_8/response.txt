  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the smallest element from index 75 to index 94, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\n```python\ndef find_smallest_num(numbers):\n  # Find the smallest number from index 75 to index 94, both inclusive\n  smallest_num = min(numbers[75:95])\n  return smallest_num\n```\n\nThe code above does not work because it is missing the loop to iterate over the list of numbers. The correct code would be:\n\n```python\ndef find_smallest_num(numbers):\n  smallest_num = float(\'inf\')\n  for number in numbers[75:95]:\n    if number < smallest_num:\n      smallest_num = number\n  return smallest_num\n```"
