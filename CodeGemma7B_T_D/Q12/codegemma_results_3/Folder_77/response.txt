  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the smallest element from index 661 to index 924, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: `\ndef find_smallest_num(num_list):\n  return min(num_list[661:925])\n```\nThe user specified an index range of 661 to 924, inclusive. Therefore, we have to use `num_list[661:925]` to get the list of numbers within the range.\n\nThe `min()` function is then used to find the smallest element in the list of numbers within the specified index range. Finally, the result is returned."
