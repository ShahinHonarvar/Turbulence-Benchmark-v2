The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the smallest element from index 12 to index 92, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nThe user should supply a list of numbers to the function, and the number of elements in the list need to be more than or equal to 100.
