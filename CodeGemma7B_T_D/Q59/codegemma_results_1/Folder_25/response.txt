The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 92. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_left_truncatable_prime(t):\n    x = t[92]\n    tp = [t for t in t if t > x]\n    prime = [t for t in tp if is_prime(t)]\n    none_zero = [t for t in prime if not str(t)[0] == 0]\n    lprime = [less_than_x(n) for n in none_zero if is_prime(n)]\n    return sorted(lprime)      \n```"
