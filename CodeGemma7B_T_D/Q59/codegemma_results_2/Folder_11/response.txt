The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 86. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\nfrom sympy import factorint\n\ndef all_left_truncatable_prime(t):\n    x = t[86]\n    res = []\n    for n in range(2, x):\n        if factorint(n) == 1:\n            a = list(str(n))\n            if \'0\' in a or len(a) != len(set(a)):\n                continue\n            for m in a[1:]:\n                if factorint(int(m)) != 1:\n                    break\n            else:\n                res.append(n)\n    return sorted(res)\n\n```"
