The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 77. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order.
