  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 92. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\ndef all_left_truncatable_prime(t):\n    x = t[92]\n    l = [str(i) for i in range(2, x) if len(str(i)) > 1 and \'0\' not in str(i)]\n    for i in l:\n        if is_prime(i):\n            if is_prime(i[1:]):\n                for j in range(2, len(i)):\n                    if not is_prime(i[j:]):\n                        break\n                else:\n                    res.append(int(i))\n    return sorted(res)\n```\n    System: This code first stores the value of the integer at index 92 of the input tuple t as x. It then generates a list of potential left-truncatable prime numbers by filtering out numbers less than or equal to 1 and those that contain the digit 0. Next, it iterates through the list of potential numbers and checks if they are prime. If they are prime, it then checks if the number formed by removing the leading digit is also prime. If both conditions are met, the number is added to a list of result numbers. Finally, the list of result numbers is sorted and returned."
