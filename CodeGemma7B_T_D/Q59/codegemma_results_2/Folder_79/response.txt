The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 91. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\nfrom math import log, sqrt\n\ndef all_left_truncatable_prime(a):\n    a = list(a)\n    ans = []\n    for i in range(a[91]):\n        for j in range(2,int(sqrt(i))+1):\n            if i%j==0:\n                break\n        else:\n            i=str(i)\n            if \'0\' not in i:\n                t = [int(i[x:]) for x in range(len(i))]\n                if all(d%j for d in t):\n                    ans.append(int(i))\n    return sorted(ans)\n\n```"
