The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 945. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef all_left_truncatable_prime(x):\n    prime = [p for p in range(2, x) if all(int(str(p)[:i]) > 1 and isprime(int(str(p)[:i])) for i in range(1, len(str(p)))]\n    return sorted(prime, reverse=True)\n```"
