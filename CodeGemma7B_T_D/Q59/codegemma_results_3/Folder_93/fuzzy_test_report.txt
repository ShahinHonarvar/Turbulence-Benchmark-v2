Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758, 622, 258, 910, 982, 812, 903, 317]


The correct answer was:

[2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, 47, 53, 67, 73, 83, 97, 113, 137, 167, 173, 197, 223, 283, 313, 317, 337, 347, 353, 367, 373, 383, 397, 443, 467]

But the LLM code returned:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 31, 37, 53, 71, 73, 113, 127, 131, 137, 151, 157, 173, 211, 223, 227, 233, 251, 257, 271, 277, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 353, 373]
