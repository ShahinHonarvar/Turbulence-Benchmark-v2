  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 42. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.>\nOutput:\n<Give rationale / explanation for your code below the code.>\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef all_left_truncatable_prime(x):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, x):\n        num = str(i)\n        if all(digit != \'0\' for digit in num) and all(isprime(int(num[index:])) for index in range(1, len(num))):\n            result.append(int(num))\n    return sorted(result)\n```\n\n<Rationale / Explanation>\n\nThe code uses the sympy library to check if a number is prime, and it iterates over all numbers from 1 to x-1 the numbers are converted to strings and checked for leading 0\'s using all(). If a number passes this check, it checks if all the remaining digits of the number form a prime number using all(). If a number passes both of these checks, it is appended to the result list."
