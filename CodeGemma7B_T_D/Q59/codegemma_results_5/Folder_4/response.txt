The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 96. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):\n        x = tup[96]\n        from sympy import isprime\n        list = []\n        for i in range(9,x):\n            if not str(i).count(\'0\') and isprime(i) and all(isprime(int(str(i)[0:j])) for j in range(2,len(str(i)))):\n                list.append(i)\n        list.sort(reverse=True)\n        return list\n        ```"
