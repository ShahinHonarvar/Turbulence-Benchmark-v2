  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 25 to index 80, both exclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_ints_exclusive(the_list):\n  return the_list[25:80]\n```\n\nThere is no need for further user input or output. If the user provides a different text specification, the expert should output the Python code accordingly.\n\nThis code snippet is designed to be run in a Python interpreter, so it does not need to be saved to a file. You can simply copy and paste the code into the interpreter and run it."
