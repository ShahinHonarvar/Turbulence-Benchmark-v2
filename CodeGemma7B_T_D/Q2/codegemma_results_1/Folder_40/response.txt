  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 0 to index 2, both exclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem:  ```python\ndef all_ints_exclusive(nums):\n    return nums[0:2]\n```\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `all_ints_exclusive` function takes a list of integers as its input parameter and returns a new list containing all elements from index 0 to index 2, both exclusive. The notation `nums[0:2]` in Python allows for slicing a list, where `0` is the starting index and `2` is the ending index (exclusive)."
