  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 221 to index 222, both exclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_ints_exclusive(arg):\n    return [x for x in arg[221:222]]\n```\nNote that the system may also give you additional examples, context, or parameters. For example, it might say: \"Here is another list: [1, 2, 3, 4]\", or \"The list is ordered in ascending order\".\n\nIt is important to note that you will not be graded on the correctness of your code. Instead, you will be graded on your ability to follow the instructions and complete the task."
