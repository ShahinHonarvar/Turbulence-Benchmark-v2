  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindrome_of_length_at_least_n\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 25 that exist in the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(text):\n  answer = set()\n  for i in range(len(text)):\n    for j in range(i, len(text)):\n      word = text[i:j+1].lower()\n      if word == word[::-1] and len(word) >= 25:\n        answer.add(word)\n  return answer\n```\nThere is a great deal of information in the code provided by the system, but it doesn\'t solve the problem. I disagree with the solution. The system provides a code that checks if a palindrome is longer than or equal to 25 characters.. The system also provides a code that checks if a palindrome\'s characters include only letters. The code does not work because it does not check for palindromes that are in the correct format (an even number of letters). Therefore, the system\'s code does not solve the problem. It should be replaced with one that works properly.\n\nThe code in the user\'s input solves the problem. The user\'s code checks if a palindrome is in the correct format (an even number of letters). The user\'s code also checks if a palindrome is longer than or equal to 25 characters. The user\'s code correctly checks for palindromes. For example, the user\'s code correctly checks that the palindrome \"racecar\" is in the correct format and has a length greater than or equal to 25 characters."
