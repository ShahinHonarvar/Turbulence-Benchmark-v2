def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):
    """
            This function takes in a string and returns a set of all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 144 that exist in the string.
            Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.

            Args:
                string: The string to search for palindromes in.

            Returns:
                A set of all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 144 that exist in the string. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set.
