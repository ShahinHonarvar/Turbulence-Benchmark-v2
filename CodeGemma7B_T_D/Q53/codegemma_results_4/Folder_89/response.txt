The function `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` takes a string `s` as input and returns the set of all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 43 that exist in the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function uses a generator expression to generate all possible substrings of the given string and then checks if each substring is a palindrome. If a substring is a palindrome, it is added to the set of palindromes."
