  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindrome_of_length_at_least_n\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 29 that exist in the given string.
