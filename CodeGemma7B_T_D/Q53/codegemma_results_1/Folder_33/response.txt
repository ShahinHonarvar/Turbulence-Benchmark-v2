  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindrome_of_length_at_least_n\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 141 that exist in the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code according to the given text specification:\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):\n    s = s.lower()\n    palindrome_set = set()\n    count = defaultdict(int)\n    n = 141\n    for c in s:\n        count[c] += 1\n    for char in count:\n        if count[char] >= n and char.isalpha():\n            palindrome_set.add(char * count[char])\n    return palindrome_set\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The code starts by importing the `defaultdict` module from the `collections` library. This is used to create a dictionary that automatically initializes missing keys with a default value of `0`.\n\n2. The function `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` is defined, which takes one argument, `s`, which is the string to search for palindromes.\n\n3. The string `s` is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method to perform case-insensitive palindrome searching.\n\n4. A set called `palindrome_set` is created to store the found palindromes.\n\n5. A dictionary called `count` is created using `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each character in the string.\n\n6. A variable `n` is set to the minimum palindrome length of 141.\n\n7. The code iterates over each character in the string and increments the count for that character in the `count` dictionary.\n\n8. The code then iterates over each `char` in the `count` dictionary.\n\n9. If the count for the character `char` is greater than or equal to `n` and the character is an English letter, it means that the character can be used to form a palindrome of the desired length. So, the palindrome `char` is added to the `palindrome_set`.\n\n10. Finally, the `palindrome_set` is returned, which contains all the palindromes of length 141 or greater found in the given string."
