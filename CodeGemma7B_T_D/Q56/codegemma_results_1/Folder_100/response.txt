  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_substring_of_size_n\' that takes one argument which is a string. The function should return the list of all distinct substrings of the length equal to 92 with no duplicate characters. If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function should return an empty list. The order of the substrings in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here\'s how you could approach this problem: \n                - Sorting the string by character. This step removes duplicate characters while ensuring that all substrings of the same length are grouped together.\n                - Substring extraction. Having the string sorted, we can iterate through it and extract all substrings of size 92.\n                - Adding unique substrings. Use a set to keep track of unique substrings. By adding substrings to the set, we automatically eliminate duplicates.\n\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(text):\n    sorted_text = sorted(text)\n    unique_substrings = set()\n    counter = 0\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_text)):\n        if counter >= 92:\n            break\n\n        if sorted_text[i] == sorted_text[i + 1]:\n            continue\n\n        substring = \'\'.join(sorted_text[i:i + 92])\n        unique_substrings.add(substring)\n        counter += 1\n\n    return list(unique_substrings)\n```"
