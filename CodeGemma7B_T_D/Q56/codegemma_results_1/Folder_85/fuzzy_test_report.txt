Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['7,gm(XNvY?O (!B,9kHc a> {$']


The correct answer was:

['XNvY?O (!B,9kH', 'NvY?O (!B,9kHc']

But the LLM code returned:
['XNvY?O (!B,9kH', 'XNvY?O (!B,9kHc', 'NvY?O (!B,9kHc']

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

'RA1Q*FX8[0D' A[}-@G$@ XkT [{X
