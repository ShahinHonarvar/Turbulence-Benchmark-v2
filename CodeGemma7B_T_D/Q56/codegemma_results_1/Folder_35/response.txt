If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function should return an empty list. The order of the substrings in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n            for i in range(len(s) - 26):\n                substring = s[i:i+27]\n                if len(set(substring)) == len(substring):\n                    return [substring]\n            return []\n        ```\n\nPlease provide a detailed explanation of the returned code.\n\n**Main Idea:**\nThe code implements a function `all_substring_of_size_n` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of substrings of size 27 with no duplicate characters. It uses a sliding window approach with a fixed size of 27 and determines if all characters in the substring are distinct using a set. If the set size matches the substring size, it appends the substring to the result list. Otherwise, it continues searching for substrings with distinct characters within the sliding window.\n\n**Explanation:**\nHere\'s a breakdown of the code:\n\n**Function Signature:**\n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n```\nThis defines a function named `all_substring_of_size_n` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of substrings.\n\n**Sliding Window:**\n\n```python\nfor i in range(len(s) - 26):\n```\nThis line initiates a `for` loop that iterates through the string `s` with an index `i`. The loop iterates from 0 to the length of `s` minus 26 to accommodate substrings of size 27.\n\n```python\nsubstring = s[i:i+27]\n```\nInside the loop\'s body, it extracts a substring of length 27 starting from the current index `i`.\n\n**Distinct Character Check:**\n\n```python\nif len(set(substring)) == len(substring):\n```\nA set is created from the substring using `set(substring)`. If the length of the set is equal to the substring length, it implies that all characters in the substring are distinct.\n\n**Result Handling:**\nIf distinct characters are found, the substring is appended to the result list using a return statement. This ensures that the function returns only substrings with distinct characters.\n\n```python\nreturn [substring]\n```\n\nIf no substrings with distinct characters are found within the loop, an empty list is returned instead.\n\n```python\nreturn []\n```\n**Overall Functionality:**\nThe code defines a function that takes a string as input and efficiently finds all substrings of size 27 with no duplicate characters. It avoids unnecessary computations and handles edge cases where no suitable substrings exist in the input string."
