  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_substring_of_size_n\' that takes one argument which is a string. The function should return the list of all distinct substrings of the length equal to 130 with no duplicate characters. If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function should return an empty list. The order of the substrings in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n  n = 130\n  result = []\n  for i in range(len(s) - n + 1):\n    substring = s[i:i+n]\n    if len(set(substring)) == n:\n      result.append(substring)\n  return result\n\n\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `all_substring_of_size_n` function takes a string as input.\n* It initializes a variable `n` to the length of the desired substrings (130).\n* It creates an empty list `result` to store the distinct substrings.\n* It uses a for loop to iterate over all possible starting indices of substrings of length `n`.\n* For each starting index, it extracts the substring using slicing notation (s[i:i+n]).\n* It checks if the substring contains only distinct characters by creating a set from it and comparing its length to `n`. If they are equal, it means that the substring contains no duplicates.\n* If the substring has no duplicates, it is appended to the `result` list.\n* Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains all distinct substrings of length 130 with no duplicates.If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function returns an empty list."
