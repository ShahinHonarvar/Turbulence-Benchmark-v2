  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_substring_of_size_n\' that takes one argument which is a string. The function should return the list of all distinct substrings of the length equal to 6 with no duplicate characters. If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function should return an empty list. The order of the substrings in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\nSystem: \n```python\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(str_):\n    if len(str_) < 6:\n        return []\n    \n    return [str_[i:i+6] for i in range(len(str_) - 5)]\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function takes one argument, `str_`, a string to search for substrings.\n* The function checks if the length of the string is less than 6. If so, it returns an empty list.\n* The function iterates through the string using a `for` loop, starting from the beginning and ending at the third-to-last character.\n* For each position `i`, it extracts a substring of length 6 and appends it to the result list.\n* The result list is returned containing all distinct substrings of length 6 or an empty list if no such substrings were found."
