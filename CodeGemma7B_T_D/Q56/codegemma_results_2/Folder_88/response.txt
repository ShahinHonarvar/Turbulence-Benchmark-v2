  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_substring_of_size_n\' that takes one argument which is a string. The function should return the list of all distinct substrings of the length equal to 68 with no duplicate characters. If no such substrings exist in the given string, the function should return an empty list. The order of the substrings in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef all_substring_of_size_n(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    The itertools module in the Python standard library provides various combinatorics functions including product which generates the Cartesian product of a list of iterables.\n\n    The code creates a list of all possible substrings of length 68 by iterating over the Cartesian product of all 68 characters in the alphabet (a-z) and 68 spaces using the itertools.product function. This produces a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a substring.\n\n    The code then converts each tuple into a string and uses a set to remove any duplicates. The set data structure in Python automatically removes duplicates, leaving only unique substrings in the list.\n\n    Finally, the code returns the list of unique substrings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    alphabet = \'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\'\n    spaces = \' \' * 68\n\n    substring_tuples = []\n    for substring in product(alphabet + spaces, repeat=68):\n        substring_tuples.append(substring)\n\n    unique_substrings = set([\'\'.join(substring) for substring in substring_tuples])\n\n    return list(unique_substrings)\n```"
