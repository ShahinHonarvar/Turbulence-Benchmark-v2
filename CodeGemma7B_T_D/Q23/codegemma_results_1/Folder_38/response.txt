  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 16 and 68, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(number):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(16, 69):\n        if number % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    if not divisors:\n        return []\n    return divisors\n```\n    System: The provided code defines a Python function named `find_divisors_in_range`. The function takes a single argument `number`, which should be a positive integer. It initializes an empty list called `divisors`. Then, it enters a loop that iterates through each integer in the range from 16 to 68 (inclusive). Inside the loop, it checks if the `number` is divisible by the current integer `i`. If the remainder of `number` divided by `i` is 0, it means `i` is a divisor of `number`. In such case, it appends `i` to the `divisors` list. After the loop finishes, it checks if the `divisors` list is empty. If it is empty, it means no divisors within the specified range were found. In such case, it simply returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns the `divisors` list, which contains all the positive divisors of the given `number` between 16 and 68."
