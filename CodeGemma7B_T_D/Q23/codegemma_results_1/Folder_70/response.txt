If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\nThe function uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers between 586 and 840, both inclusive. For each number, the function checks if the given integer is divisible by the number. If it is, the number is added to the list of divisors.\n\nFinally, the function returns the list of divisors. If the list is empty, it means that no divisors were found in the specified range, so an empty list is returned instead."
