  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 6 and 8, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(number):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(6, 9):\n        if number % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe `find_divisors_in_range` function takes a single argument, `number`, which is the integer for which we need to find divisors.\n\nInside the function, we initialize an empty list called `divisors`.\n\nThe function then iterates over the values from 6 to 8, inclusive, using a `for` loop. For each value of `i` in this range, we check if `number` is divisible by `i`. If it is, we append `i` to the `divisors` list.\n\nFinally, we return the `divisors` list. If no divisors were found in the specified range, the list will be empty."
