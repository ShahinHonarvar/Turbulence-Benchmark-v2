  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 469 and 682, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def find_divisors_in_range(n):\n            divisors = []\n            for i in range(469, 683):\n                if n % i == 0:\n                    divisors.append(i)\n            return divisors\n        ```\n        System: The provided code snippet defines a function called `find_divisors_in_range`. This function takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. It initializes an empty list called `divisors` to store the found divisors within the specified range. The function then enters a `for` loop that iterates through the integers from 469 to 682, inclusive. Inside the loop, it checks if the given number `n` is divisible by the current integer `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by `i`, it appends `i` to the `divisors` list. Finally, the function returns the `divisors` list containing either the found divisors inside the specified range or an empty list if no divisors were found within that range."
