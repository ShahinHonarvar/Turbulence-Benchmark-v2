  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 71 and 81, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_divisors_in_range(num):\n            divisors = []\n            for i in range(71,82):\n                if num % i == 0:\n                    divisors.append(i)\n            if len(divisors) == 0:\n                return []\n            else:\n                return divisors\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `find_divisors_in_range` takes a positive integer `num` as its argument.\n* It initializes an empty list called `divisors`.\n* It iterates over the numbers between 71 and 81 (inclusive) using a `for` loop.\n* Inside the loop, it checks if `num` is divisible by the current number `i` and, if it is, adds `i` to the `divisors` list.\n* After the loop, it checks the length of the `divisors` list:\n    * If the length is 0, it means no divisors were found within the specified range, so it returns an empty list.\n    * Otherwise, it returns the `divisors` list."
