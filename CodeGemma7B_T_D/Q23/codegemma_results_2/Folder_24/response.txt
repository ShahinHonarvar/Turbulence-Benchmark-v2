  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 43 and 95, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```\n        def find_divisors_in_range(num):\n            divisors = []\n            for i in range(43, 96):\n                if num % i == 0:\n                    divisors.append(i)\n            return divisors or []\n        ```\n\nTherefore, the provided input specifies the creation of a Python function named `find_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its input and returns a list of divisors of the given integer that are between 43 and 95, inclusive. If no divisors are found within this range, the function returns an empty list."
