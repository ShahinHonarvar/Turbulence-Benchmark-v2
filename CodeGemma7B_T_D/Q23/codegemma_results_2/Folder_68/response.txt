  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 3 and 6, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nImplement the \'find_divisors_in_range\' function as follows:\n        - Create an empty list.\n        - Iterate from 3 to 6 inclusive.\n        - For each number in the range, check if the given integer is divisible by that number.\n        - Add any divisors found to the empty list.\n        - Return the list of divisors.\n        If no divisors are found in the specified range, return an empty list.\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(3, 7):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```"
