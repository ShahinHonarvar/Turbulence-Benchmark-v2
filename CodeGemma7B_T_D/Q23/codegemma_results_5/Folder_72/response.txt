The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 32 and 90, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code for finding all the divisors of a number between 32 and 90:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(a):\n    for i in range(32, 91):\n        if a%i == 0:\n            print(i)\n```\n\nThis function is tested using the following code:\n\n```python\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter the number to find the divisors of: \"))\nprint(\"The divisors of the number are:\")\nfind_divisors_in_range(number)\n```"
