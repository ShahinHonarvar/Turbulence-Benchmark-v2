  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 35 and 55, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(num):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(35, 56):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n```\n\nThe code defines a function `find_divisors_in_range` to take a number as its argument.\nThe function initializes an empty list called `divisors`.\nIt then iterates through numbers from 35 to 55, inclusive, using a `for` loop. For each number, it checks if the number is a divisor of the given integer `num` using the modulo operator (%). If the modulo operation results in a remainder of 0, it means the current number is a divisor of `num`. In this case, the divisor is appended to the `divisors` list.\nFinally, the function returns the list of divisors or an empty list if no divisors are found in the specified range."
