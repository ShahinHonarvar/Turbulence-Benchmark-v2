  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 45 and 72, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_divisors_in_range(x):\n    if x % 2 == 0:\n        if x % 3 == 0:\n            if x % 5 == 0:\n                if x % 7 == 0:\n                    return [x]\n    return []\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `find_divisors_in_range` takes an integer `x` as input.\n* It first checks if `x` is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7 using modulo operations.\n* If `x` is divisible by all four numbers, the function returns a list containing `x` (since it is the only positive divisor in the specified range).\n* If `x` is not divisible by all four numbers, the function returns an empty list."
