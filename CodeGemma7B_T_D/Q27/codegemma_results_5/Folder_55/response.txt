  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_index\' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 141.02 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 1 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: \n```python\ndef insert_after_index(lst):\n    return lst[:2] + [141.02] + lst[2:]\n```\n```\n\nAs suggested by the provided code, the `insert_after_index` function takes a list as input and returns a new list with the element 141.02 inserted at the index immediately succeeding 1. This is achieved by slicing the list into two parts, including all elements from the beginning up to the second element (index 1) and all elements from the third element (index 2) onwards, and then concatenating the three parts in the desired order. The resulting list will have one more element than the input list due to the insertion of 141.02."
