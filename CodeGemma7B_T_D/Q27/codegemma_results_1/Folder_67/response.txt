  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_index\' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 76 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 44 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code:\n\n```python           \ndef insert_after_index(nl):\n    nl.insert(44 + 1, 76)\n    return(nl)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `insert_after_index` function takes a list as input. It then uses the `insert` method to insert the number 76 at the index immediately succeeding index 44, which is 44 + 1. Finally, the function returns the modified list."
