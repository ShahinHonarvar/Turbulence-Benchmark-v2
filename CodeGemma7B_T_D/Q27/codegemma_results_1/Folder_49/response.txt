  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_index\' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [27, 34] has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 38 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef insert_after_index(lst):\n    idx = 38\n    return lst[:idx+1] + [27, 34] + lst[idx+1:]\n```\n      \n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `insert_after_index` takes one argument, `lst`, which is a list.\n* The variable `idx` is initialized to 38, which represents the index where we want to insert the new elements.\n* The code uses list slicing to create two substrings: `lst[:idx+1]` and `lst[idx+1:]`.\n* The first substring contains all the elements from the beginning of the list up to and including the element at index 38.\n* The second substring contains all the elements from the element after index 38 up to the end of the list.\n* The new elements, `[27, 34]`, are inserted between these two substrings using list concatenation.\n* Finally, the function returns the updated list, which includes the new elements at the specified index.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```\n>>> lst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]\n>>> insert_after_index(lst)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 34]\n```"
