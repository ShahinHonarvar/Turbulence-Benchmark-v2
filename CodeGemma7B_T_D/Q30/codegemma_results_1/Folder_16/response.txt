  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_before_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'n\' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character \'w\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def insert_before_character(text):\n            return text.replace(\"wn\", \"nwn\")\n        ```\n\nThe specified character is \'w\' and we need to insert \'n\' before the specific occurrence of \'w\'. In our example, we simply replace \'wn\' with \'nwn\' because all occurrences of \'wn\' in the string also include an \'n\' followed by a \'w\' and in this case, the insertion of \'n\' before the \'w\' in \'wn\' has no effect."
