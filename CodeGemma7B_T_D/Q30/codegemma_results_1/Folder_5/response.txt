  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_before_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'G\' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character \'c\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef insert_before_character(str1):\n  output = []\n  for s in str1:\n    output.append(s)\n    if s == \'c\':\n      output.append(\'G\')\n  return \'\'.join(output)\n```\n\n**Note:** The question asked for a function called `insert_before_character` that takes a string as an argument â€“ not an array. The solution should reflect this change."
