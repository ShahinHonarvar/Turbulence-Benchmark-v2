  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_before_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'N\' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character \'x\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef insert_before_character(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Inserts the character \'N\' immediately preceding any occurrences of the character \'x\' in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        text: The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new string with \'N\' inserted before each occurrence of \'x\'.\n    \"\"\"\n    output = \'\'.join(map(lambda c: \'N\' + c if c == \'x\' else c, text))\n    return output\n```\n        \n\n### Explanation of the `insert_before_character` Function:\n\n* **`from itertools import product`:** This line imports the `product` function from the `itertools` module.\n* **`def insert_before_character(text):`:** This defines a function named `insert_before_character` that takes one argument, `text`, of type string.\n* **`\"\"\"`:** These triple quotes are used to document the function.\n* **`Inserts the character \'N\' immediately preceding any occurrences of the character \'x\' in a string.`:** This is the function\'s documentation.\n* **`Args:`:** This header specifies the function\'s arguments.\n* **`text: The input string.`:** This specifies that the `text` argument is of type string and represents the input to the function.\n* **`Returns:`:** This header specifies the function\'s return value.\n* **`A new string with \'N\' inserted before each occurrence of \'x\'.`:** This specifies the type and description of the return value.\n* **`output = \'\'.join(map(lambda c: \'N\' + c if c == \'x\' else c, text))`:** This line implements the core logic of the function. Here, it performs the following steps:\n    * **`map(lambda c: \'N\' + c if c == \'x\' else c, text)`:** This uses the `map` function to iterate over each character in the `text` string and apply a lambda function to each character. The lambda function checks if the current character is equal to \'x\'. If it is, it concatenates the character \'N\' with the current character and returns the result. Otherwise, it simply returns the current character.\n    * **`\'\'.join()`:** This joins the transformed characters back into a single string and stores the result in the `output` variable.\n* **`return output`:** This returns the newly created string with \'N\' inserted before each occurrence of \'x\'."
