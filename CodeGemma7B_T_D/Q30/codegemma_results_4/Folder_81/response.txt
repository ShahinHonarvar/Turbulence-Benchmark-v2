  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_before_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'A\' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character \'A\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def insert_before_character(string):\n            new_string = \"\"\n            for char in string:\n                if char == \"A\":\n                    new_string += \"A\" + char\n                else:\n                    new_string += char\n\n            return new_string\n\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `insert_before_character()` function takes a string as input and returns a new string with the character \'A\' inserted before each occurrence of the letter \'A\'.\nInside the function, a new string, `new_string`, is initialized to an empty string.\nThe function iterates over each character in the input string.\nFor each character, it is checked if the character is \'A\'. If the character is \'A\', it is prepended to the `new_string`, followed by the original character.\nIf the character is not \'A\', it is simply appended to the `new_string`.\nFinally, the function returns the `new_string`."
