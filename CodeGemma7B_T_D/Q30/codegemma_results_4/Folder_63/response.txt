  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_before_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'R\' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character \'5\'.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def insert_before_character(text):\n            result = \"\"\n            for char in text:\n                if char == \'5\':\n                    result += \'R\' + char\n                else:\n                    result += char\n            return result\n        ```\nThis solution is valid and concise. It utilizes a for loop to iterate through each character in the input string. When it encounters a \'5\', it appends an \'R\' followed by the \'5\' to the result string. Otherwise, it simply appends the current character. Finally, the function returns the result string."
