  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 894.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def find_subset_of_length_n(set):\n            from itertools import combinations\n            return sum(1 for _ in combinations(set, n) if n == 894)\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `find_subset_of_length_n` function implements the following algorithm:\n\n1. It imports the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module.\n\n2. It defines a function called `find_subset_of_length_n` that takes a set argument.\n\n3. It uses the `combinations` function to generate all possible subsets of the given set and the size specified as 894.\n\n4. It then uses a generator expression to count the number of subsets that have a size of 894. The sum of this generator expression represents the total number of subsets of size 894.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the result."
