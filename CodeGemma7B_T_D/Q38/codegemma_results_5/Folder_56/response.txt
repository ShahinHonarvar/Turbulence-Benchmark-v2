The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 60.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(a):\n  \"\"\"The mathematical formula for the number of combinations of n elements taken r at a time is Cn(n,r)\n\n  where n = the total number of elements in a set\n        r = the number of elements chosen at a time\n\n  Can also be calculated as:\n\n        Cn(n,r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\n  -- Using the formula for calculating number of subsets of length N from total length of set size N\n  When N = total length of set (n = |a|) and r = size of subset (r = 60)\n\n        C60(n,60) = n! / (60!(n-60)!)\n\n  For this we need to import the math module which has a factorial function as it calculates the factorial of a number\n  can use the following formula to calculate the desired result \n  C60(n,60) = math.factorial(n) / (math.factorial(60) * math.factorial(n - 60))\n\n  Also, we need to use the len function from the built-in modules to calculate the size of the parameter passed to the function as it will be the value of n in the formula\"\"\"\n\n  print(math.factorial(len(a)) / (math.factorial(60) * math.factorial(len(a) - 60)))\n\n```"
