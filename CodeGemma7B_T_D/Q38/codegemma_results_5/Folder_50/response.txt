  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 40.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(s):\n    return len(list(combinations(s, 40)))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `find_subset_of_length_n()` function takes a set `s` as input and uses the `combinations()` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible subsets of size 40.\n\nThe `combinations()` function returns an iterator that yields all possible combinations of elements from the input set, without regard to order.\n\nWe convert the iterator to a list and use the `len()` function to count the number of elements in the list.\n\nFinally, we return the count as the result of the function."
