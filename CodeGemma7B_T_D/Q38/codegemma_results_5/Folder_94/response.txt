  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 93.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):\n            from itertools import combinations\n            \n            count = 0\n            for subset in combinations(set_of_elements, 93):\n                count += 1\n                \n            return count \n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The code starts with a function named `find_subset_of_length_n` that takes one argument called `set_of_elements`.\n* It then imports the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module, which will be used to generate subsets of the given set.\n* The variable `count` is initialized to 0.\n* A loop iterates over the `combinations` of the `set_of_elements` with a length of 93.\n* For each `subset`, the value of `count` is incremented by 1.\n* Finally, the function returns the value of `count`."
