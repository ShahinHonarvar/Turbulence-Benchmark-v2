The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 96.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_subset_of_length_n(set):\n            return bin(pow(2, len(set))).count(\'1\')\n        ```\n\nAs an expert in Python programming, I have created a function called `find_subset_of_length_n` that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 96. This function uses the formula 2^n, where n is the size of the set, to calculate the total number of subsets. The function then uses the `bin` function to convert this number to a binary representation, and the `count` method to count the number of 1s in the binary representation. This number represents the number of all subsets of size 96."
