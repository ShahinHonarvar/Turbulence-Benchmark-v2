  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 360.>\nOutput:\nThe function should work as follows:\n        Given a set of elements, a subset of size n can be formed by choosing n elements from the original set.\n        The order of the chosen elements does not matter, so {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"} is the same as {\"c\", \"b\", \"a\"}.\n        To find the number of subsets of size n, simply take the total number of elements in the set to the power of n and divide by the total number of unique elements in the set.\n        There are n elements in the set, so the number of subsets of size n is (n!) / (n! * (n - 360)!)\n        The number of unique elements in the set is n.\n        Therefore, the number of subsets of size 360 is (n!) / (n! * (n - 360)!)\n\n```python\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(e):\n    return (len(e) ** 360) // (len(e) ** (len(e) - 360))\n```"
