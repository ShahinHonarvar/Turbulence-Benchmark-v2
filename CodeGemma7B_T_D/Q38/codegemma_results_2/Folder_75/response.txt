  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 80.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def count_subsets(total_elements):\n            def find_subset_of_length_n(current_element, remaining_elements, current_subset):\n                if len(current_subset) == 80:\n                    return 1\n                if not remaining_elements:\n                    return 0\n                return (find_subset_of_length_n(remaining_elements[0], remaining_elements[1:], current_subset + [remaining_elements[0]]) + \\\n                       find_subset_of_length_n(remaining_elements[0], remaining_elements[1:], current_subset))\n            return find_subset_of_length_n(next(iter(total_elements)), list(total_elements)[1:], [])\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `count_subsets` takes one argument, `total_elements`, which is a set of elements.\n* The function calculates the number of subsets by using a recursive helper function, `find_subset_of_length_n`.\n* The helper function takes three arguments:\n    * `current_element`: The current element being considered.\n    * `remaining_elements`: The remaining elements in the set.\n    * `current_subset`: The current subset being constructed.\n* The base case checks if the current subset has reached a size of 80. If so, it returns 1 to indicate that we have found a valid subset.\n* If the remaining elements are exhausted, there are no more subsets to explore, so we return 0.\n* Otherwise, we consider two options:\n    * Include the current element in the subset.\n    * Exclude the current element from the subset.\n* The function recursively explores both options by passing the next element in the `remaining_elements` list to the helper function.\n* The recursive calls return the number of subsets that include the current element and the number of subsets that do not include it.\n* The main function initializes the recursion by calling the helper function with the first element of the set, the remaining elements (excluding the first), and an empty subset."
