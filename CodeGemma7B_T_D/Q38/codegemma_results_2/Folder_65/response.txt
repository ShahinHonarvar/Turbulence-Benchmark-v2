  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 35.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):\n            number_of_subsets = 2 ** len(set_of_elements)\n            return number_of_subsets\n        ```\n\nHere is the text specification the user provided:\n\n`<Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 35.>`\n\nThe code the system generated is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):\n    number_of_subsets = 2 ** len(set_of_elements)\n    return number_of_subsets\n```\n\nThis coding is not exactly equivalent to the user\'s request because it doesn\'t specifically determine the number of subsets of size 35. Instead, it calculates the total number of subsets by raising 2 to the power of the length of the set.\n\nTo address this discrepancy, we can modify the code to explicitly count the number of subsets of size 35:\n\n```python\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):\n    number_of_subsets = 0\n    for subset in itertools.combinations(set_of_elements, 35):\n        number_of_subsets += 1\n    return number_of_subsets\n```\n\nWith this change, the code will now iterate through all possible combinations of size 35 from the input set using the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module. For each combination, it will increment the `number_of_subsets` variable. Finally, it will return the total number of subsets of size 35."
