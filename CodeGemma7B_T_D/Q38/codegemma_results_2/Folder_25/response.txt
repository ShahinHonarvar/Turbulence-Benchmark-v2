  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 90.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(set_size):\n    return 2 ** set_size\n```\n\nAs an expert in Python programming, I understand the text specification and can generate Python code that meets the requirement. The code I provided calculates the number of subsets of a given set based on the formula 2 raised to the power of set size. This formula provides an efficient and accurate way to determine the total number of subsets without resorting to looping or recursion."
