  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 36.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_subset_of_length_n(set_):\n            n = 2**len(set_)\n            return int(n/36)\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code uses the powerset formula to calculate the number of subsets of a set. The powerset formula is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in the set. The code then divides this number by 36 to get the number of subsets of size 36."
