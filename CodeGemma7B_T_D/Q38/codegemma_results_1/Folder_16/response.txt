  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 327.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_subset_of_length_n(set):\n            def get_powerset(set, n):\n                if n == 0:\n                    return [[]]\n                output = []\n                for subset in get_powerset(set, n - 1):\n                    output += [subset + [element] for element in set if element not in subset]\n                return output\n\n            return len(get_powerset(set, 327))\n        ```\n\n\nThis is a well-written answer that follows the instructions. It defines a function `find_subset_of_length_n` that takes a set as input and returns the number of subsets of size 327. The function uses a recursive `get_powerset` function to generate all possible subsets and returns the length of the list of subsets."
