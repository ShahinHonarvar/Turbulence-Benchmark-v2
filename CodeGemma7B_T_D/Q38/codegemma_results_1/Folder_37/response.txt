  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 28.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):\n          // Code to be added here\n        ```\n        System: The requested text specification does not mention the word \"for\" and does not ask for a specific return value from the function. The user has also not provided a specific set of elements to process with the function. The provided function definition is not complete, missing the return statement. To complete the function, you can consider using the `itertools.combinations()` function, which generates combinations of elements from a given iterable, and using a loop to iterate over each combination and increment a counter. For example:\n        ```python\n        from itertools import combinations\n\n        def find_subsets(elements, n):\n            return sum(1 for combination in combinations(elements, n))\n        ```"
