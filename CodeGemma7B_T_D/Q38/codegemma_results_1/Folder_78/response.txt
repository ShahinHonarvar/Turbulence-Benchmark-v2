  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 91.>\nOutput:\nOutput: {{{\n```python\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(a):\n  return len(a) ** 91\n\n```\n}}}\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe function takes a set of elements and returns the number of all its subsets of size 91. It does this by taking the length of the set and raising it to the power of 91. This is because the number of subsets of a set of size n is 2^n."
