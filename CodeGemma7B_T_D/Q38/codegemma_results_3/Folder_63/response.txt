  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 57.>\nOutput:\n--\n```python\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):\n  n = 57\n  num_subsets = 2**len(set_of_elements)\n  return num_subsets\n```\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `find_subset_of_length_n` takes one argument, a set of elements.\n- The function calculates the number of subsets of size `n` using the formula `2^n`. It does this by calculating the length of the set and raising 2 to that power.\n- The function returns the number of subsets.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```python\nset_of_elements = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\nnum_subsets = find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements)\nprint(num_subsets)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n2**10 = 1024\n```"
