  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 372.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code for <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 372>:\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(a):\n    return len(list(combinations(a, 372)))\n```\n\nAs would be expected, this function utilizes the `combinations` function from the itertools module, which returns an iterator of all combinations of size 372 without repetition. The size of this iterator is then found and returned as the number of subsets of size 372 within the input set `a`."
