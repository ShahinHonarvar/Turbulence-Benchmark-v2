  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_subset_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 327.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_subset_of_length_n(set):\n    length = 0\n    for subset in powerset(set):\n        length += (len(subset) == 327)\n    return length\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function **find_subset_of_length_n** takes a set of elements as input.\n* It initializes a variable **length** to keep track of the number of subsets of size 327.\n* It iterates over all the possible subsets of the input set using the **powerset** function.\n* For each subset, it checks if its length is equal to 327. If it is, it increments the **length** variable.\n* Finally, the function returns the total number of subsets of size 327."
