  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 19 and 94.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def gcf_two_nums(int_list):\n            if len(int_list) != 100 or int_list[94] == 0 or int_list[19] == 0:\n                return None\n            gcd = int_list[94]\n            for num in int_list[20:94]:\n                gcd = int(gcd / math.gcd(gcd, num))\n            return gcd\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Python code does not contain any comments. It creates a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. It then checks if the list has the correct length (100) and if the numbers at indices 94 and 19 are not zero. If either of these conditions is false, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it initializes `gcd` to the value at index 94. It then iterates over the numbers at indices 20 to 94 (excluding 94) and calculates the greatest common factor between `gcd` and each number. The result is then assigned back to `gcd`, which effectively computes the greatest common factor of all the numbers in the slice from indices 20 to 94. Finally, the function returns `gcd`."
