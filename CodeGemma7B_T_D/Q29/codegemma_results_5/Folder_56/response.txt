  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 84 and 13.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    a = nums[84]\n    b = nums[13]\n    c = a % b\n    while c != 0:\n        a = b\n        b = c\n        c = a % b\n    return b```\n\nThe code represents a Python function called `gcf_two_nums` which receives a list of positive integers as an argument and it returns the greatest common factor of the two integers at positions 84 and 13 in the list.\nThis code accomplishes the task by implementing the Euclidean Algorithm, which calculates the greatest common factor of two numbers using a cycle of division and modulo operations until the remainder is zero."
