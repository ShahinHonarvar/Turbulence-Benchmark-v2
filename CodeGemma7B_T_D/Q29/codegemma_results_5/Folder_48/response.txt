  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 618 and 195.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(t_list):\n    a,b = t_list[618], t_list[195]\n    while b:\n        a,b = b,a%b\n    return a\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code you provided defines a Python function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor (gcf) of the integers at indices 618 and 195. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcf of the two numbers. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and replacing the larger number with the remainder until the remainder is 0. The gcf of the two numbers is then the smaller of the two numbers at this point."
