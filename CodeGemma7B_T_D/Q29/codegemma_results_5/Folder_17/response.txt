  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 69 and 40.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(list):\n  num_69 = list[68]\n  num_40 = list[39]\n  greatest_common_factor = math.gcd(num_69, num_40)\n  return greatest_common_factor\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `gcf_two_nums` is created.\n* It takes one argument, a list of positive integers.\n* The function stores the values of the elements at indices 68 and 39 in the variables `num_69` and `num_40`, respectively.\n* It uses the `math.gcd` function to find the greatest common factor of the two numbers.\n* The result is returned."
