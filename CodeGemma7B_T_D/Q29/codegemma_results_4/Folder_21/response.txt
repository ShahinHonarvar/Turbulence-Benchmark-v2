The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 198 and 212.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(a):\n    return math.gcd(a[198], a[212])\n```\n[Additional Information]\n* The math module is already imported.\n* The list of integers is stored in the variable \'a\'.\n* The greatest common factor (gcf) of two integers can be calculated using the math.gcd() function."
