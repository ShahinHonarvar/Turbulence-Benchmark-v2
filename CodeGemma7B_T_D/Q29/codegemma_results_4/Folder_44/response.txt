  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 56 and 88.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(test_list):\n    a = test_list[56]\n    b = test_list[88]\n    while a != 0 and b != 0:\n        if a > b:\n            a = a % b\n        else:\n            b = b % a\n    return a or b\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n* It extracts the integers at indices 56 and 88 as variables `a` and `b`.\n* It uses a while loop to continue iterating until both `a` and `b` become zero.\n* Inside the loop, it checks if `a` is greater than `b` and, if so, it updates `a` by taking the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. Otherwise, it updates `b` in the same way.\n* After the loop terminates, `a` or `b` will contain the greatest common factor.\n* Finally, the function returns `a` or `b` as the result."
