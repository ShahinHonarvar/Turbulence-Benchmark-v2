  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 69 and 40.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n  return gcf(nums[69], nums[40])\n\ndef gcf(a, b):\n  return a if b == 0 else gcf(b, a % b)\n```\n\n\nTo clarify, the text specification should be interpreted as a description of a function named `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 69 and 40. The function `gcf` is used to find the greatest common factor of two numbers. The greatest common factor of a list of integers can be found by taking the greatest common factor of the first two integers, and then taking the greatest common factor of the result and the third integer, and so on. The `gcf_two_nums` function is used to find the greatest common factor of the first two integers in the list, which are at indices 69 and 40.\n\nThe code we generated uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common factor of two numbers. The Euclidean algorithm is a simple and efficient algorithm for finding the greatest common factor of two numbers. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number, and taking the remainder. The algorithm continues until the remainder is zero. The greatest common factor of the two numbers is the value of the remainder after the algorithm terminates."
