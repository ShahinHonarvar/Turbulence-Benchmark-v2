  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 64 and 28.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    return math.gcd(nums[64], nums[28])\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function name is `gcf_two_nums`.\n* The function takes one argument, a list of positive integers `nums`.\n* The function returns the greatest common factor (gcd) of the integers at indices 64 and 28. The `math.gcd()` function can be used to calculate the gcd of two numbers. In this case, we pass the numbers at indices 64 and 28 to the `math.gcd()` function."
