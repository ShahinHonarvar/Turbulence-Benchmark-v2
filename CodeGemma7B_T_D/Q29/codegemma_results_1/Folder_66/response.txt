  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 86 and 89.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_two_nums(nums):\n    a, b = extract_nums_by_index(nums, 86), extract_nums_by_index(nums, 89)\n    g = use_euclidean_algorithm(a, b)\n    return g\n\ndef extract_nums_by_index(nums, index):\n    return nums[index]\n\ndef use_euclidean_algorithm(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\nThe user-supplied text specification is inside the triple backticks. The Python code should be limited to only what is required by the text specification. No additional functionality should be added.\n\n**Note:** The Euclidean algorithm is used to find the greatest common factor of two numbers.\n\nPlease provide the Python code as requested."
