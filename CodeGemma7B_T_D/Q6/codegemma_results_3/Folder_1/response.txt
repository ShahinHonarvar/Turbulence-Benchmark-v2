  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_neg_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 66 to index 90, both exclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\ndef all_neg_ints_exclusive(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[66:90] if num < 0]\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* `def all_neg_ints_exclusive(nums):` This defines the function called `all_neg_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as its argument.\n* `return [num for num in nums[66:90] if num < 0]`: This line uses list comprehension to create a new list of negative integers from index 66 to 90 (exclusive). It iterates through the list of numbers from index 66 to 90 and checks if each number is less than 0. If it is, the number is added to the new list.\n* The result is an empty list if there are no negative integers in the specified range."
