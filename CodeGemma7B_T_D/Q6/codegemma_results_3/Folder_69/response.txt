  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_neg_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 68 to index 99, both exclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_neg_ints_exclusive(list):\n            return [i for i in list[68:99] if i < 0]\n        ```\n        System: The provided code snippet is correct.\n        \n### In this case the user wants the function to start from the 69th index in the list, since it\'s exclusive. However the correct code contains the 68th index, so this should be fixed. The code should be:\n```python\ndef all_neg_ints_exclusive(list):\n    return [i for i in list[68:99] if i < 0]\n```"
