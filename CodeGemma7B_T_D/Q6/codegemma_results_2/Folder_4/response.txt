  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_neg_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 10 to index 76, both exclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Sure, here is the code you requested.\n\n```python\ndef all_neg_ints_exclusive(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[10:76] if num < 0] or []\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `all_neg_ints_exclusive` function takes a list of integers as input. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate through the elements of the list from index 10 to index 76 (exclusive). For each element, it checks if the element is negative. If it is negative, it is added to the result list. If no negative elements are found in the specified range, an empty list is returned."
