The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'remove_repeat_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character in the given string that occurs more than once between the indices 375 and 926, both exclusive, the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string.
