  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'remove_repeat_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character in the given string that occurs more than once between the indices 70 and 200, both exclusive, the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(string):\n    seen_chars = set()\n    new_string = []\n    for char in string:\n        if char not in seen_chars and 70 < string.index(char) < 200:\n            seen_chars.add(char)\n            new_string.append(char)\n    return \'\'.join(new_string)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The `seen_chars` set keeps track of characters that have been encountered so far.\n- The `new_string` list will hold the modified string.\n- The `for` loop iterates over each character in the input string.\n- If the character is not in `seen_chars` and its index is greater than 70 (exclusive) and less than 200 (exclusive), we add it to `seen_chars` and append it to `new_string`. Otherwise, we only append it to `new_string`.\n- Finally, we convert `new_string` to a string and return it."
