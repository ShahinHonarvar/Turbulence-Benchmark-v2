  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'remove_repeat_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character in the given string that occurs more than once between the indices 17 and 88, both exclusive, the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def remove_repeat_chars(text):\n            seen = set()\n            result = []\n            for i in range(17, 88):\n                if text[i] not in seen or i == 17:\n                    seen.add(text[i])\n                    result.append(text[i])\n            return \'\'.join(result)\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code uses a set called `seen` to keep track of characters that have already been encountered. This ensures that each character is only removed if it has been encountered multiple times within the specified range.\n\nThe code also uses a list called `result` to store the modified string. This allows for the preservation of the order of characters in the original string.\n\nThe `for` loop iterates over the characters in the string from index 17 to 88 (inclusive). For each character, the code checks if it has been encountered before using the `in` operator. If it has not been encountered or if we are on the first iteration (when `i == 17`), we add it to the `seen` set and the `result` list.\n\nAfter processing all the characters in the specified range, the code joins the characters in the `result` list into a string using the `join` method and returns it."
