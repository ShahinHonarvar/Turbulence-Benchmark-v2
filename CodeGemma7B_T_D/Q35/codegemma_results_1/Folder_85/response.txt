  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'remove_repeat_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character in the given string that occurs more than once between the indices 1 and 8, both exclusive, the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(str):\n    \"\"\"remove repeated character between index 1 and 8\"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    result = \"\"\n    for i in range(1, 8):\n        if str[i] not in seen:\n            result += str[i]\n            seen.add(str[i])\n    return result\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* `seen`: This set keeps track of all characters we have encountered up to the current index.\n* `result`: This string accumulates the new, filtered string.\n* `for i in range(1, 8)`: This loop iterates over the characters in the string from index 1 to index 8 (exclusive).\n* `if str[i] not in seen`: This condition checks if the current character has been seen before between index 1 and 8. If not, we add it to the `result` string and mark it as seen in the `seen` set.\n* `seen.add(str[i])`: This line adds the current character to the `seen` set, marking it as encountered.\n* `return result`: After processing all characters between indices 1 and 8, the function returns the `result` string containing the filtered result."
