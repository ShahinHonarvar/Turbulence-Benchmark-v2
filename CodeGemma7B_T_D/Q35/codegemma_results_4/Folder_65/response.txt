  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'remove_repeat_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character in the given string that occurs more than once between the indices 51 and 76, both exclusive, the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(text):\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(text):\n        if i >= 51 and i <= 76 and char in seen:\n            continue\n        seen.add(char)\n        result.append(char)\n\n    return \'\'.join(result)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* An empty set `seen` is created to track characters that have been encountered within the specified range.\n* A new list `result` is initialized to store the filtered characters.\n* The function iterates over each character in the input string `text`.\n* For each character, its index `i` is checked if it falls within the range [51, 76) (inclusive).\n* If the character is in `seen` and lies within the range, it is skipped, as we only remove duplicates outside this range.\n* Otherwise, the character is added to `seen` to mark it as encountered and appended to the `result` list.\n* Finally, the `result` list is joined into a string and returned."
