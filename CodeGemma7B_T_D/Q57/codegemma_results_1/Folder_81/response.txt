  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'submatrix_with_particular_sum\' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -90. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    # Pre-process matrix\n    matrix = matrix.cumsum(axis=0).cumsum(axis=1)\n\n    # Find all submatrices with the desired sum\n    submatrices = []\n    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):\n            for k in range(i, matrix.shape[0]):\n                for l in range(j, matrix.shape[1]):\n                    submatrix_sum = matrix[k, l] - matrix[i, l] - matrix[k, j] + matrix[i, j]\n                    if submatrix_sum == -90:\n                        submatrices.append(matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1])\n\n    # Return empty list if no submatrices found\n    return submatrices if submatrices else []\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `cumsum()` method calculates the cumulative sum along each axis, creating a prefix sum matrix.\n* The nested loops iterate over all possible submatrices, using the prefix sum matrix to efficiently calculate the sum of each submatrix in constant time.\n* The `if` condition checks if the sum of the submatrix equals -90. If so, the submatrix is appended to the `submatrices` list.\n* If no submatrices are found, an empty list is returned using the ternary operator."
