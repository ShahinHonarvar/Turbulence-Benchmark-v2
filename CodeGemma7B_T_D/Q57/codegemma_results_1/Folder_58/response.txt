Given the objective of finding all submatrices with a given sum, it is recommended that you explore and implement the use of nested loops for iterating over the elements of the matrix. The goal is to find all submatrices where the sum of elements equals a particular sum. The four loops in this example are in may be applied to the indices of the matrix along the rows and columns. The four nested loops below, from the outer level to the inner level, loop through the rows and columns of the matrix in the following ways:\nThe outer two loops ( representing indices for rows ) denote the upper left and lower right submatrix boundaries.\nThe inner two loops ( representing indices for columns ) denote the lower left and upper right submatrix boundaries.\nThe four nested loops iterate through each submatrix and calculate the sum of elements in these submatrices.\nIf the submatrix sum is equal to the desired sum (-137) then the indices of the submatrix is appended or added to the list of indices and the submatrices so that they can be retrieved.\n```python\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n     write your code here\n    \"\"\"\n    indices = []\n    submatrices = []\n\n    for row_start in range(len(matrix)):\n        for row_end in range(row_start, len(matrix)):\n            for col_start in range(len(matrix[0])):\n                for col_end in range(col_start, len(matrix[0])):\n                    submatrix = matrix[row_start:row_end+1, col_start:col_end+1]\n                    if submatrix.sum() == -137:\n                        indices.append((row_start, row_end, col_start, col_end))\n                        submatrices.append(submatrix)\n\n    return indices, submatrices\n```"
