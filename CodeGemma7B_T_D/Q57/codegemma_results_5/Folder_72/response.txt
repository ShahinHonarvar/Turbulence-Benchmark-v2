  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'submatrix_with_particular_sum\' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 41. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):\n  ans = []\n  for matrix_row in matrix:\n    for matrix_col in matrix_row:\n      temp_ans = []\n      for row in matrix:\n        temp = row[matrix_col:matrix_col+matrix_row[matrix_col]].tolist()\n        temp_ans.append(temp)\n      if sum(map(sum, temp_ans)) == 41:\n        ans.append(temp_ans)\n  return ans\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `submatrix_with_particular_sum()` function takes a 2D numpy matrix as input and returns a list of submatrices with a sum of 41.\n* For each row in the matrix, we iterate over each column.\n* For each column, we create a temporary submatrix by slicing the original matrix from the current column to the current column plus the length of the current row.\n* We convert the temporary submatrix to a list of lists.\n* If the sum of all integers in the temporary submatrix equals 41, we append it to the list of submatrices.\n* Finally, we return the list of all submatrices with a sum of 41 or an empty list if none are found."
