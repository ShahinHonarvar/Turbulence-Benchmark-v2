The function `submatrix_with_particular_sum` takes a 2-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input and returns a list of all submatrices with a sum of -157. The function iterates over the matrix and compares the sum of all integers in each submatrix to -157. If a submatrix with a sum of -157 is found, it is appended to the `submatrices` list. Finally, the function returns the `submatrices` list."
