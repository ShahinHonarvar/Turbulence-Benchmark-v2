  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'submatrix_with_particular_sum\' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 752. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code for the given input:\n```python\nimport numpy as _numpy\ndef submatrix_with_particular_sum(_matrix):\n  top_range = _numpy.shape(_matrix)[0]\n  top_range = top_range - 3\n  result_list = []\n  for i in range(top_range):\n    for j in range(i + 4):\n      submatrix = _matrix[i:j, i:j]\n      if _numpy.sum(submatrix) == 752:\n        result_list.append(submatrix)\n  return result_list\n```\n\nThis code will generate a list of all submatrices with the sum of all integers equal to 752. Remember that in different versions of numpy, the function `shape(_matrix)` could return the shape as tuple directly, so you should be careful if you want to make this code compatible with all versions of numpy."
