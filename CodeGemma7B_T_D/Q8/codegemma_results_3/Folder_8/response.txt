  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 56 to index 92, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: So, the function should accept a list of integers as input and return a list of only even numbers (excluding the numbers at indices 56, 57 and 92). The function should also handle cases where the input list is empty or where there are no even numbers in the specified range. Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_exclusive(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return []\n    filtered_nums = []\n    for i in range(56, 92):\n        if i not in (56, 57, 92) and nums[i] % 2 == 0:\n            filtered_nums.append(nums[i])\n    return filtered_nums\n```"
