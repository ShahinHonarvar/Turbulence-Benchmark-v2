  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 32 to index 99, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_exclusive(lst):\n  return [i for i in lst[32:99] if i % 2 == 0] or []\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `all_even_ints_exclusive` takes a list of integers as input.\n* It extracts a slice of the list from index 32 to index 99, both exclusive.\n* It filters the slice to include only even integers.\n* It returns the filtered list.\n* If no even integers are found in the specified range, an empty list is returned."
