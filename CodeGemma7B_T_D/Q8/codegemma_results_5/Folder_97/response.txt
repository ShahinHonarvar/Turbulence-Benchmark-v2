  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 20 to index 93, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Below is the Python code based on the given text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_exclusive(num_list):\n  result = []\n  for num in num_list[20:93]:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n      result.append(num)\n  return result if result else []\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `all_even_ints_exclusive` takes one argument, `num_list`, which is a list of integers.\n* It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the even integers found within the specified range.\n* It then iterates over the elements of `num_list` between index 20 and 93, both exclusive.\n* For each integer `num`, it checks if `num` is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). If `num` is even, it appends it to the `result` list.\n* After iterating through the entire list, it returns the `result` list, which contains all the even integers found in the specified range. If no even integers were found, the function returns an empty list."
