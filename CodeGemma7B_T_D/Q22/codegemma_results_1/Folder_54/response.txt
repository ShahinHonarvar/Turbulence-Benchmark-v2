  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_sum_of_multiples\' that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 29 possitive multiples of the given integer.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code for the problem:\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(num):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the sum of the first 29 multiples of a given number.\"\"\"\n  sum = 0\n  for i in range(1, 30):\n    sum += i * num\n  return sum\n```\nThis code defines a function called `find_sum_of_multiples` that takes a positive integer as an argument and returns the sum of the first 29 multiples of that integer. The code starts by initializing a variable called `sum` to 0. It then loops through the numbers from 1 to 29, and for each number, it multiplies the number by the given integer and adds it to the `sum` variable. Finally, the code returns the value of the `sum` variable."
