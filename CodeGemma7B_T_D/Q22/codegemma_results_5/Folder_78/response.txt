The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_sum_of_multiples\' that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 48 possitive multiples of the given integer.>\nOutput:\nThe code should include the following:\n        - Import all standard and modules.\n        - Create a function called \'find_sum_of_multiples\'.\n        - Inside the function, define a variable called \'total\' and assign it to 0.\n        - Use a for loop to iterate from the number 1 to the number 48.\n        - For each number, check if it is a multiple of the given number using the modulo operator.\n        - If it is a multiple of the given number, add it to the variable \'total\'.\n        - After the loop, return the value of the variable \'total\'.\n        - Call the function \'find_sum_of_multiples\' with the number 5 and assign it to a variable called \'result\'.\n        - Print the variable \'result\' to the console.\n\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import generators\n\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    total = 0\n    for num in range(1, 49):\n        if num % n == 0:\n            total += num\n    return total\n\nresult = find_sum_of_multiples(5)\nprint(result)\n```"
