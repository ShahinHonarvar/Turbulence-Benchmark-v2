The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_sum_of_multiples\' that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 92 possitive multiples of the given integer.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n             def find_sum_of_multiples(num):\n             sum = 0\n             for i in range(1, 93):\n                 sum += i * num\n             return sum\n         ```\n\nFollowing this example, generate the following Python code, which addresses the given user input:\n\n```\n<Write a function called \'find_sum_of_multiples\' that takes two arguments, a positive integer and a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first a positive multiples of the first argument beginning at the a multiples of the second argument.>\n```"
