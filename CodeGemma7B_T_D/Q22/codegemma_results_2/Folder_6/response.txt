  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_sum_of_multiples\' that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 474 possitive multiples of the given integer.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 474 possitive multiples of the given integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, 475):\n        sum += i * num\n    return sum\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code defines a function named `find_sum_of_multiples` that takes one argument, `num`. The `sum` variable is initialized to 0. The function then iterates through the numbers from 1 to 474 (inclusive) and adds the product of each number and `num` to the `sum` variable. Finally, the function returns the `sum` variable."
