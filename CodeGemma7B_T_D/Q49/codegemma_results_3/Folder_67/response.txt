  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_decimal_is_divisible\' that takes one argument, a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer. In the given binary representation the most significant digit appears first. The function should return true if the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 107th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it should return false. The first number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence is 0.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def if_decimal_is_divisible(x):\n            # ... code ...\n        ```\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```python\ndef if_decimal_is_divisible(x):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    count = 0\n    while count < (10**8):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        if b > (2**31):\n            b = b % (2**31)\n        if len(str(b)) > len(str(x)) and b % int(\'\'.join([\'1\' if i == \'0\' else \'0\' for i in x]), 2) == 0:\n            return True\n        count += 1\n    return False\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code first generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10 millionth term. For each term, it checks if it is longer than the binary representation of the input number and if it is divisible by the complement of the input number in binary. The complement is found by replacing each \'0\' (zero) with \'1\' and each \'1\' (one) with \'0\'. The complement is then converted back to a decimal integer before checking for divisibility. If the complement is divisible by the Fibonacci number, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False after checking all Fibonacci numbers up to the 10 millionth term."
