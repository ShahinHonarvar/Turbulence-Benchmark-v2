The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_decimal_is_divisible\' that takes one argument, a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer. In the given binary representation the most significant digit appears first. The function should return true if the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 104th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it should return false. The first number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence is 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary):\n            binary_length = len(binary)\n            result_decimal = int(binary, 2)\n            fib_pointer = 1\n            fib_terms = [1, 2]\n            count = 2\n\n            while result_decimal >= fib_terms[fib_pointer]:\n                fib_terms.append(fib_terms[fib_pointer] + fib_terms[fib_pointer - 1])\n                fib_pointer += 1\n\n            return True if fib_terms[fib_pointer] % result_decimal == 0 else False\n        ```\nThe response should fit the user\'s needs while adhering to the requirements. The response should not include any unnecessary comments or code outside of the triple backticks."
