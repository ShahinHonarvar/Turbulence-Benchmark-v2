  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_decimal_is_divisible\' that takes one argument, a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer. In the given binary representation the most significant digit appears first. The function should return true if the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 177th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it should return false. The first number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence is 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef if_decimal_is_divisible(binary):\n    fib2, fib1, mod = 0, 1, 177\n    for i in binary:\n        if i == \'0\':\n            fib2, fib1 = fib1, fib2 + fib1\n        else:\n            fib2, fib1 = fib1, fib2 + fib1*2\n        if fib2 >= mod:\n            fib2, fib1, mod = fib2 % mod, fib1 % mod, mod\n    return fib2 == 0\n```\nThis is the most optimized solution. It uses two Fibonacci numbers, fib2 and fib1, to store the last two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. It iterates through the binary string, and for each bit, it updates fib2 and fib1 based on the bit\'s value. It also modularizes fib2 and fib1 to keep the values within the 177-th number sequence of the Fibonacci sequence. If, at the end of the iteration, fib2 is equal to 0, it means that the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 177th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it is not divisible."
