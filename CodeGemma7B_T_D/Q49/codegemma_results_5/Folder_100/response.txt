  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_decimal_is_divisible\' that takes one argument, a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer. In the given binary representation the most significant digit appears first. The function should return true if the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 190th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it should return false. The first number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence is 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def if_decimal_is_divisible(num_str):\n            fib_nums = [0, 1]\n            while fib_nums[-1] < num_str:\n                fib_nums.append(fib_nums[-1] + fib_nums[-2])\n            return int(num_str, 2) in fib_nums[189:]\n        ```\n        This code uses a list as a Fibonacci sequence and checks if the decimal value of the given number is in the list. The code avoids generating all Fibonacci numbers by checking if the last Fibonacci number in the list is greater than the given number. Then, the code checks if the given number is in the suffix of Fibonacci sequence with length greater than 189."
