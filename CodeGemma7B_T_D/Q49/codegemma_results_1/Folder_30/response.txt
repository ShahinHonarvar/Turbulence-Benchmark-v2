  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_decimal_is_divisible\' that takes one argument, a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer. In the given binary representation the most significant digit appears first. The function should return true if the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 186th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it should return false. The first number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence is 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_representation):\n            binary_int = int(binary_representation, 2)\n\n            fibonacci_terms = [0]\n            for n in range(1, 187):\n                fibonacci_terms.append(fibonacci_terms[n - 1] + fibonacci_terms[n - 2])\n\n            return binary_int in fibonacci_terms[186:]\n```\n\nThis solution assigns the binary representation string to the variable `binary_representation` and converts it to an integer in base 2. It then creates a list of Fibonacci terms up to the 187th term. Finally, it checks if the decimal integer is in the Fibonacci terms from the 187th term onwards. If the decimal integer is in this list, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`."
