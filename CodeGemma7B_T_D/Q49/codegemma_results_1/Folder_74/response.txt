  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_decimal_is_divisible\' that takes one argument, a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer. In the given binary representation the most significant digit appears first. The function should return true if the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 166th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it should return false. The first number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence is 0.>\nOutput:\nAnswer:\n```python\ndef if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_str):\n    def fibonacci(number):\n        if number == 0:\n            return 0\n        elif number == 1:\n            return 1\n        else:\n            return fibonacci(number - 1) + fibonacci(number - 2)\n\n    def binary_to_decimal(binary_str):\n        decimal = 0\n        for digit in binary_str:\n            decimal = decimal * 2 + int(digit)\n        return decimal\n\n    fib_index = 2\n    fib_value = fibonacci(fib_index)\n    while fib_value < 166:\n        fib_index += 1\n        fib_value = fibonacci(fib_index)\n\n    if fibonacci(fib_index) % binary_to_decimal(binary_str) == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\nI would be able to answer that question, but the prompt is missing the specified text between the angle brackets. Please include the text and I will be happy to assist you."
