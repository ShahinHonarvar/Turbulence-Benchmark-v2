  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_decimal_is_divisible\' that takes one argument, a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer. In the given binary representation the most significant digit appears first. The function should return true if the decimal integer corresponding to the given string is divisible by the 69th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence; otherwise, it should return false. The first number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence is 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_str):\n    def fibonacci_iter():\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        while True:\n            yield a\n            a, b = b, a + b\n\n    fibonacci_num = next((f for f in fibonacci_iter() if f >= int(binary_str, 2)))\n    return fibonacci_num % 69 == 0\n```\nThis code defines a function `if_decimal_is_divisible` that takes a binary representation string as an argument. The function calculates the first Fibonacci number greater than or equal to the decimal integer represented by the binary string. The decimal integer is calculated by converting the binary string to a decimal integer and dividing it by 2. The Fibonacci number is then checked for divisibility by 69. Finally, the result is returned as a boolean value."
