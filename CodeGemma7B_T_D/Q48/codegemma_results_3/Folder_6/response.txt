  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_binary_or_hexa\' that takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. Let \'a\' denote the integer stored at index 20, and \'b\' the integer stored at index 93. The function should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 20 and 93. If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation should not be prefixed with \'0b\'. The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with \'0x\'. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tu):\n    a, b = tu[20], tu[93]\n    res = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tu[20:94]:\n            res += i\n    if res & 1:\n        return bin(res)[2:]\n    return hex(res)[2:].upper() if res <= 0xF else hex(res)[2:]\n```\n        User: <The code looks good. Just wanted to confirm if it handles exceptional cases like where the tuple is not filled up to index 94. If it doesn\'t handle such cases, kindly explain why it is not handling them and suggest any improvements.>\n        System: The code does not handle exceptional cases where the tuple is not filled up to index 94. One possible reason for this is that the code assumes that the tuple is always valid and does not perform any bounds checking. As a result, accessing elements beyond the valid range would lead to an IndexError. To handle such cases, one could perform bounds checking before accessing the tuple elements at indices 20 and 93. Here\'s an updated version of the code with bounds checking:\n\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(tu):\n    if len(tu) <= 94:\n        raise ValueError(\"Tuple must be filled up to index 94\")\n\n    a, b = tu[20], tu[93]\n    res = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1, b):\n        if i not in tu[20:94]:\n            res += i\n    if res & 1:\n        return bin(res)[2:]\n    return hex(res)[2:].upper() if res <= 0xF else hex(res)[2:]\n```"
