Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27]


The correct answer was:

1000011

But the LLM code returned:
67

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 28, 31)
