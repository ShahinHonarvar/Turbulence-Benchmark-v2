  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_binary_or_hexa\' that takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. Let \'a\' denote the integer stored at index 36, and \'b\' the integer stored at index 52. The function should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 36 and 52. If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation should not be prefixed with \'0b\'. The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with \'0x\'. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef return_binary_or_hexa(array):\n    \"\"\"Returns a string containing the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum of all elements not present in the specified index range.\n\n    Args:\n        array: A tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.\n\n    Returns:\n        A string containing the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum, without any prefixes or leading zeros.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input tuple is not sorted in ascending order or contains duplicate elements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Check if the input tuple is sorted in ascending order and contains no duplicates.\n    if not (array == sorted(array)) or (len(set(array)) != len(array)):\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input tuple.\")\n\n    # Extract the integers to be summed.\n    a = array[36]\n    b = array[52]\n\n    # Calculate the sum.\n    sum_ = sum(x for x in range(a + 1, b) if x not in array)\n\n    # Return the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum.\n    return bin(sum_)[2:] if sum_ % 2 else hex(sum_)[2:]\n```"
