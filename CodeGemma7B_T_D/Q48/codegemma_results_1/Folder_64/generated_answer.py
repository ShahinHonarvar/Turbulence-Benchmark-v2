    """
    return_binary_or_hexa:
    Calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 that are not present in the tuple between indices 0 and 5.
    If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary
    representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the
    hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary
    representation should not be prefixed with '0b'. The hexadecimal
    representation should not be prefixed with '0x'. The binary and
    hexadecimal representations should be in reverse order, with the most
    significant digit first. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both
    inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the
    function should return an empty string.

    Parameters:
        nums: tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order.

    Return:
        string: The binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 that are not present in the tuple between indices 0 and 5.
