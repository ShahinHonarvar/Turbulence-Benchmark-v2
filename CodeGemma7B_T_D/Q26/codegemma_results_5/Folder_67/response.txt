  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_in_range\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 31 and 50, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def sum_in_range(nums):\n            result = 0\n            for num in nums:\n                if num >= 31 and num <= 50:\n                    result += num\n            return result\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `sum_in_range()` function takes a list of integers as input. It initializes a variable `result` to 0.\n\nInside the `for` loop, the function checks if each number in the list is between 31 and 50 (inclusive). If it is, the number is added to the `result` variable.\n\nAfter iterating through the entire list, the function returns the value of `result`. If no numbers in the list are within the specified range, the function will return 0."
