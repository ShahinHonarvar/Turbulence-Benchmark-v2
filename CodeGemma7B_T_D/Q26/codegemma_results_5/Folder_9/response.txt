The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_in_range\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 4 and 5, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nOutput:```python\ndef sum_in_range(a):\n  sum = 0\n  for x in a:\n    if x >= 4 and x <= 5:\n      sum += x\n  return sum\n```\n\n**Note:** The code provided by the system should be used as a starting point for the user\'s code. The user should modify the code as needed to complete the task specified in the user prompt."
