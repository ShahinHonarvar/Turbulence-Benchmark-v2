  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_in_range\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 44 and 67, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def sum_in_range(nums):\n            total = 0\n            for num in nums:\n                if 44 <= num <= 67:\n                    total += num\n            return total or 0\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `def` keyword defines a function named `sum_in_range`.\n* The function takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of integers.\n* A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to store the cumulative sum.\n* The `for` loop iterates through each element in the `nums` list.\n* Inside the loop, a condition checks if the current element `num` is between 44 and 67 (inclusive). If it is, `total` is incremented by `num`.\n* After iterating through the entire list, the function returns `total`.\n* If `total` remains 0, it means no elements in the list fall within the specified range. Therefore, `total` is set to 0 and returned."
