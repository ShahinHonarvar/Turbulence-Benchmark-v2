The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\n        def find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n            nums = sorted(nums)\n            if len(nums) < 200 or nums[200] == nums[0] or nums[90] == nums[-1]:\n                return None\n            return nums[91]\n```\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
