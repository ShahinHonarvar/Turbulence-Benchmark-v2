  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 50 to index 200, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nOutput (Python): ```python\n  def find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n    filtered_nums = sorted([num for num in nums[50:201] if num != min(nums)])\n    return filtered_nums[1] if filtered_nums else \'None\'\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `find_second_smallest_num` takes a list of numbers as input.\n* It extracts numbers from index 50 to index 200, both inclusive, using slicing.\n* It removes the smallest element using a list comprehension and the `min()` function.\n* It sorts the filtered list of numbers.\n* It returns the second element in the sorted list if it exists, otherwise it returns \'None\'."
