  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 4 to index 8, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n          if len(nums) < 9 or not nums[4:9]:\n            return None\n          nums[4:9].sort()\n          return nums[5]\n        ```\n        Explanation:\n        1. The function `find_second_smallest_num` is defined.\n        2. The function takes one argument `nums` which is a list of distinct numbers.\n        3. If the length of the input list is less than 9 or if the slice `nums[4:9]` is empty, it returns `None`.\n        4. It sorts the slice from index 4 to index 8 using the `sort` method.\n        5. It returns `nums[5]` which is the second smallest element in the sorted slice."
