  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 639 to index 975, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n            if len(nums) < 639 or len(nums) > 975:\n                return \'None\'\n            nums.sort()\n            return nums[639] if len(nums) > 639 else \'None\'\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `find_second_smallest_num()` function takes a list of distinct numbers as input.\n* It checks if the length of the list is valid (between 639 and 975, inclusive).\n* If the list is not valid, the function returns \'None\'.\n* Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order.\n* If the list has at least 639 elements, it returns the element at index 639.\n* If the list has fewer than 639 elements, it returns \'None\'."
