  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 0 to index 4, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n    if len(nums) < 5:\n        return \'None\'\n    nums.sort()\n    return nums[1]\n```\nQuestion: The question asks for the second smallest number from index 0 to index 4, both inclusive. However, the code provides the second smallest number from index 1 to index 4, both inclusive. The minor error exists in the following line:\n```python\n    return nums[1]\n```\nIt should be corrected to be:\n```python\n    return nums[0]\n```"
