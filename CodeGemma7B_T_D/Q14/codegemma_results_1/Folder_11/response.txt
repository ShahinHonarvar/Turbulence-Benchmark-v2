  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 66 to index 93, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\ndef find_second_smallest_num(my_list):\n    if not (66 <= len(my_list) <= 93):\n        return None\n    else:\n        return sorted(my_list[66:93])[1]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function first checks if the length of the input list is between 66 and 93 (inclusive).\n* If the list is not within this range, it returns \'None\'.\n* Otherwise, it sorts the sublist from index 66 to 93 using the `sorted()` function and the `itemgetter()` operator to sort the elements in ascending order.\n* The second element of the sorted sublist, which is the second smallest element, is returned."
