  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 1 to index 100, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(numbers):\n  if not numbers or len(numbers) < 2 or max(numbers) <= 1 or 100 not in range(len(numbers)):\n    return \'None\'\n\n  sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers[1:101])\n  return sorted_numbers[1] if len(sorted_numbers) >= 2 else \'None\'\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function checks for invalid inputs: an empty list, a list with less than 2 elements, a maximum element less than or equal to 1, or an index range outside the list\'s bounds. If any of these conditions are met, it returns \'None\' immediately.\n\n2. **Sorting and Filtering**: It creates a sorted copy of the input list using the `sorted()` function. The slice `[1:101]` selects elements from index 1 to 100, inclusive.\n\n3. **Second Smallest Element**: If the sorted list has at least two elements, it returns the second element, which represents the second smallest element in the specified index range. Otherwise, it returns \'None\' to indicate that no such element exists."
