The function takes a single argument, `nums`, which is a list of distinct numbers. The function then creates a new list called `nums[3:6]`, which contains the elements from index 3 to index 5, both inclusive. The function then checks if there are at least 5 elements in the `nums` list by checking `len(nums)`. If there are not, the function returns `\'None\'`. Otherwise, the function returns the second element from the `nums[3:6]` list. The second element in this list is at index 1 because the first element is the smallest and the second element is the second smallest. The result is then returned."
