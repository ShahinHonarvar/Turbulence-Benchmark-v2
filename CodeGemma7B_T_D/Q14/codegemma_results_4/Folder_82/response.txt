  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is your Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n    nums.sort()\n    if len(nums) < 20 or len(nums) > 200:\n        return \'None\'\n    return nums[20:201][1]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `find_second_smallest_num` takes a list of numbers as input.\n* The list is sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method.\n* The function checks the length of the list. If the list is shorter than 20 or longer than 200 elements, it returns \'None\'.\n* If the list meets the required length, it returns the second smallest element between indices 20 and 200, inclusive.**"
