  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n\ndef find_second_smallest_num(nums):\n  nums.sort()\n  if len(nums) >= 26 and nums[25] < nums[-1]:\n    return nums[26]\n  return None\n  ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `find_second_smallest_num()` function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function returns \'None\'.\n\nFirst, the function sorts the input list in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest elements are at the beginning of the list.\n\nNext, the function checks if the list has at least 26 elements and if the element at index 25 is less than the last element in the list. If both conditions are met, then the element at index 26 is the second smallest element from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive.\n\nFinally, if neither condition is met, the function returns \'None\'."
