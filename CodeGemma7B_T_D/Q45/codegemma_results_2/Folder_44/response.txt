  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 3 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 2 to index 7, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code for palindromes_between_indices, the function starts by creating a set for storing the palindromes created. The function then extracts the letters from the given string between index 2 to index 7, inclusive. The function checks if the length of the extracted letters is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, the function creates a list of all possible permutations of the extracted letters using itertools.product(). The function then checks if each permutation is a palindrome. If it is, the function converts the permutation to a set of characters and adds it to the set of palindromes. The function returns the set of palindromes. If no palindromes are found, the function returns an empty set.\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(word):\n    palindromes = set()\n    word = word[2:7 + 1]\n    if len(word) >= 3:\n        for letters in permutations(word):\n            letters = \'\'.join(letters)\n            if letters == letters[::-1]:\n                palindromes.add(set(letters))\n    return palindromes\n```"
