def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    """
    Returns the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 6 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 0 to index 7, both inclusive.

    Returns:
        A set of all palindromes of the length of at least 6 that can be created from the English letters in the given string between index 0 to index 7, both inclusive. If no such palindromes exist, an empty set is returned.
