  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 4 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 1 to index 3, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(word):\n    set_of_palindromes = set()\n    for item in permutations(word[1:4]):\n        palindrome = \'\'.join(item)\n        if palindrome.lower() not in set_of_palindromes:\n            set_of_palindromes.add(palindrome.lower())\n    return set_of_palindromes\n```\n\n**Method Explanation:**\n\n- The `permutations()` function from the `itertools` module generates all possible permutations of a string, which the code uses to generate all possible palindromes of the specified length.\n- Each palindrome generated is converted to lowercase, ensuring a case-insensitive search for duplicates in the set.\n- If no palindromes are found, the set remains empty and is returned."
