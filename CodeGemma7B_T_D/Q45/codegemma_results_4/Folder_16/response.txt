  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 5 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 6 to index 9, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code for the function palindromes_between_indices:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(text):\n  letters = \'\'.join(sorted([c.lower() for c in text[6:10] if c.isalpha()]))\n  palindromes = set()\n\n  for i in range(5, len(letters) + 1):\n    for j in range(i):\n      word = letters[j:j+i]\n      if word == word[::-1]:\n        palindromes.add(word)\n\n  return palindromes\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function takes a string as input.\n* It extracts the letters between indices 6 and 9 (inclusive) and converts them to lowercase and sorted.\n* It then iterates over the sorted letters to generate palindromes of all possible lengths.\n* For each palindrome, it checks if it is a valid palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.\n* If the palindrome is valid, it is added to the set of palindromes.\n* Finally, the set of palindromes is returned."
