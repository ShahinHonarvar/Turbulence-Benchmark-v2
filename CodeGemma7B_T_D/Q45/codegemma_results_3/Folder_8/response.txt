  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 5 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 1 to index 5, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Consider the following steps:\n\n1. Create a dictionary of lowercase characters and their corresponding indices in the given string.\n2. Calculate the total number of different characters in the dictionary.\n3. If the total number of different characters is less than 5, return an empty set.\n4. Iterate over all combinations of 5 characters from the dictionary using a combination iterator.\n5. For each combination, check if all characters in the combination are unique. If they are not, skip this combination.\n6. Create a list of the indices of the characters in the combination, sorted in ascending order.\n7. Sort the indices in reverse order.\n8. Join the indices into a string, separated by commas.\n9. Convert the joined indices into an integer.\n10. For each arrangement of the characters in the combination, check if it forms a palindrome of the specified length.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(st):\n    char_indices = {char.lower(): i for i, char in enumerate(st, start=1) if char.isalpha()}\n\n    if len(char_indices) < 5:\n        return set()\n\n    palindromes = set()\n\n    for combination in combinations(char_indices.keys(), 5):\n        if len(set(combination)) != 5:\n            continue\n\n        indices = sorted([char_indices[char] for char in combination])\n        indices.reverse()\n        joined_indices = \",\".join(str(i) for i in indices)\n        palindrome_index = int(joined_indices)\n\n        for rearrangement in permutations(combination):\n            test_palindrome = \"\".join(rearrangement)\n            if test_palindrome[0:5] == test_palindrome[-5:]:\n                palindromes.add(palindrome_index)\n\n    return palindromes\n```"
