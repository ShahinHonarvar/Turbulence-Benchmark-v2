  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 6 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 4 to index 9, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def palindromes_between_indices(string):\n            # Write your code here.\n        ```\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(string):\n    from itertools import permutations\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    def is_palindrome(word):\n        return word == word[::-1]\n\n    if len(string) < 14:\n        return set()\n\n    # Create a dictionary of counts for each letter in the string between indices 4 and 9, both inclusive.\n    counts = defaultdict(int)\n    for c in string[4:10]:\n        counts[c.lower()] += 1\n\n    # Generate all possible permutations of the letters in the dictionary.\n    unique_letters = list(counts)\n    unique_letters.sort()\n    permutations = list(permutations(\'\'.join(unique_letters)))\n\n    # Create all possible palindromes from the permutations, checking if each one is valid.\n    palindromes = set()\n    for perm in permutations:\n        word = \'\'.join(perm)\n        if is_palindrome(word) and len(word) >= 6:\n            if is_valid_palindrome(word, counts):\n                palindromes.add(word)\n\n    return palindromes\n\ndef is_valid_palindrome(word, counts):\n    for letter in word:\n        if letter not in counts:\n            return False\n        counts[letter] -= 1\n        if counts[letter] < 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The code first checks if the string length is at least 14. If not, it returns an empty set.\n* It creates a dictionary to store the count of each letter in the string between indices 4 and 9, inclusive.\n* It generates all possible permutations of the letters in the dictionary using `itertools.permutations`.\n* It checks each permutation to see if it forms a palindrome of length at least 6, while also ensuring that each letter in the palindrome is present in the original string and that the letter counts in the dictionary are not violated.\n* If a valid palindrome is found, it is added to the set of palindromes.\n* Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes."
