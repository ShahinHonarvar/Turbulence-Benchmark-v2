  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 3 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 6 to index 8, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Sure, follow these steps:\n\n1. The function name is `palindromes_between_indices`.\n2. The function takes in one argument, `text`, an argument of type str.\n3. Within the function, use a dictionary to store the frequency of each distinct character encountered in the range `[6, 8]` from the `text` argument.\n4. To avoid case sensitivity, convert all characters in the dict in step 3 to lowercase.\n5. Use itertools to generate all possible permutations of the characters in the dictionary in step 3.\n6. For each permutation, check if it forms a palindrome of the length of at least 3.\n7. If a palindrome is formed, convert it to lowercase and add it to a set to avoid duplicates.\n8. After iterating through all permutations, return the set of palindromes.\n9. If no palindromes were found, return an empty set.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(text):\n  frequencies = defaultdict(int)\n  for char in text[6:9]:\n    frequencies[char.lower()] += 1\n\n  palindromes = set()\n  for permutation in permutations(frequencies.keys()):\n    word = \'\'.join(permutation)\n    if word == word[::-1] and len(word) >= 3:\n      palindromes.add(word.lower())\n\n  return palindromes\n```"
