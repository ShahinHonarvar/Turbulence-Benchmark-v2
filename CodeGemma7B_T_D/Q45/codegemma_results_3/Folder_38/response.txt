  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 5 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 3 to index 8, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_between_indices(str):\n    def is_palindrome(word):\n        return word == word[::-1]\n\n    result = set()\n    for combination in itertools.permutations(str[3:8]):\n        combination = \'\'.join(combination).lower()\n        if is_palindrome(combination) and len(combination) >= 5:\n            result.add(combination)\n\n    return result\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `palindromes_between_indices` function takes a string as input and returns a set of palindromes.\n\n2. It defines an inner function `is_palindrome` to check if a string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.\n\n3. It uses the `itertools.permutations` function to generate all possible permutations of the letters between indices 3 and 8 (inclusive).\n\n4. It converts each permutation to lowercase and checks if it is a palindrome of length greater than or equal to 5.\n\n5. If a palindrome is found, it is added to the result set.\n\n6. The function returns the set of palindromes or an empty set if none are found."
