  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 4 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 4 to index 6, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem:**\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef palindromes_between_indices(text):\n    indexes = range(4, 7)\n    english_letters = set(\'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\')\n    palindromes = set()\n    alphabets = text[indexes[0]:indexes[-1]+1]\n    alphabets_set = set(alphabets)\n    if not alphabets_set.issubset(english_letters):\n        return palindromes\n    for i in permutations(alphabets):\n        if \'\'.join(i) in english_letters and text[indexes[0]] == i[len(i)//2] and text[indexes[-1]] == i[len(i)//2]:\n            palindromes.add(\'\'.join(i).lower())\n    return palindromes\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Imports:** We import the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible permutations of the letters in the specified range.\n\n2. **Indexes and Alphabet Range:** We define the range of indices from 4 to 6 (inclusive), resulting in the letters between those indices. We also obtain the alphabets from the string within this range.\n\n3. **English Letter Subset:** We check if the set of alphabets is a subset of the set of English letters. If not, we return an empty set because palindromes can only be formed from English letters in the given range.\n\n4. **Permutations:** We use the `permutations` function to generate all possible arrangements of the alphabets.\n\n5. **Palindrome Validation:** For each permutation, we check if it forms a palindrome by comparing the first and last letters to the middle letter. We also convert the palindrome to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n\n6. **Palindrome Addition:** If the palindrome is a valid English palindrome and satisfies the symmetry condition, we add it to the set of palindromes.\n\n7. **Return Palindromes:** Finally, we return the set of unique palindromes. If no palindromes are found, we return an empty set."
