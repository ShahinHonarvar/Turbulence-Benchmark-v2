    This function takes one argument and returns a set of all palindromes of the length of at least 3 possible
    arrangements of the English letters in the string that occur between index 6 to index 8, inclusive. If
    no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that
    occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form
    each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.

    Returns:
      set: A set of case-insensitive palindromes of the length of at least 3.
