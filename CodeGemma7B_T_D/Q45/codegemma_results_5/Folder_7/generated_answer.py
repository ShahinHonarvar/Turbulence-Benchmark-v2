    Write a function called 'palindromes_between_indices' that takes one argument,

    return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 7 such that each palindrome 
    is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string
    that occur between index 1 to index 9, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the
    specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur
    in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should
    form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.
