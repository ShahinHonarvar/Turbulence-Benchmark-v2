    Finds all palindromes of the length of at least 4 such that each palindrome
    is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string
    that occur between index 3 to index 6, both inclusive.

    Args:
        text: A string that may consist of any character.

    Returns:
        A set of all palindromes of the length of at least 4 such that each palindrome
        is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string
        that occur between index 3 to index 6, both inclusive. If no such
        palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English
        letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function
        should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a
        case-insensitive manner.
