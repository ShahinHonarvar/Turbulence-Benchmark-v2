  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'composite_nums_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 52 to index 71, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    composites = set(i for i in nums[52:71+1] if not is_prime(i))\n    return composites or set()\n```\nThe provided code snippet appears to be a valid Python solution to the given text specification. It defines a function called ``composite_nums_between_indices`` that accepts a list of positive integers as input and returns a set of composite numbers between index 52 and index 71 (inclusive). The code iterates over the sublist of the input list between the specified indices, checks if each element is composite (using a helper function ``is_prime`` assumed to be available), and adds the composite numbers to a set. If no composite numbers are found in the specified range, the code returns an empty set.\n\nHere\'s a breakdown of the code:\n\n- The function takes a list of positive integers called ``nums`` as its input argument.\n- It creates an empty set called ``composites`` to store the composite numbers found between the specified indices.\n- The code then iterates over the sublist of ``nums`` between index 52 and index 71 (inclusive) using a list comprehension. It checks if each element in the sublist is composite (using the ``is_prime`` function).\n- If an element is composite, it is added to the ``composites`` set.\n- Finally, the code checks if the ``composites`` set is empty. If it is not empty, the function returns the ``composites`` set; otherwise, it returns an empty set.\n- The helper function ``is_prime`` is not included in the code snippet and must be assumed to be available if using this solution."
