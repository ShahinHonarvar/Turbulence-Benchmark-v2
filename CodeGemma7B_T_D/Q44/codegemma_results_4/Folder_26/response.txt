The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'composite_nums_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 22 to index 50, both inclusive.
