  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'composite_nums_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 4 to index 4, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code for the given text specification:\n```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n    result = set()\n    for i in range(4, len(nums) - 3):\n        if not is_prime(nums[i]):\n            result.add(nums[i])\n    return result\n```\nThis function iterates through each element in the list and checks whether it\'s prime or not. If it\'s not prime, the function adds it to the result set. The result set is then returned."
