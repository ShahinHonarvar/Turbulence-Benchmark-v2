  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'composite_nums_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 68 to index 86, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n            composites = set()\n            for i in range(68, 87):\n                if nums[i] % 2 == 0 or nums[i] % 3 == 0:\n                    composites.add(nums[i])\n            return composites\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code defines a function `composite_nums_between_indices` that takes a list of integers as input. It initializes an empty set `composites` to store composite numbers. Then, it iterates through the list from index 68 to 86 (inclusive) using a `for` loop. For each element at the current index `i`, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the number is divisible by either 2 or 3, it is a composite number, so it is added to the `composites` set. Finally, the function returns the `composites` set, which contains all composite numbers between index 68 and 86, or an empty set if no composite number is found."
