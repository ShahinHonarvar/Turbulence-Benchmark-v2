  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'composite_nums_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 56 to index 57, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n  composites = set()\n  for i in range(56, 58):\n    if nums[i] > 1 and not is_prime(nums[i]):\n      composites.add(nums[i])\n  return composites\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `composite_nums_between_indices` is defined, which takes a list of integers `nums` as its input.\n* A set called `composites` is initialized to store the composite numbers within the specified range.\n* An `if` statement checks if each number in the list `nums` between indices 56 and 57 is composite (greater than 1 and not prime). If a composite number is found, it is added to the `composites` set.\n* Finally, the `composites` set is returned. If no composite numbers were found within the specified range, an empty set is returned."
