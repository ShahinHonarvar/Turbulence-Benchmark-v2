  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'composite_nums_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 6 to index 6, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef composite_nums_between_indices(nums):\n  composite_nums = set()\n  for i in range(nums[6], nums[6] + 1):\n    if not is_prime(i):\n      composite_nums.add(i)\n  return composite_nums\n```\n\nThis code is the requested function, based on the given text specification. It iterates over the list between index 6 to index 6, inclusive, checks if each number is prime, and then adds the composite numbers to a set. The `is_prime` function is assumed to be available and not included in the code."
