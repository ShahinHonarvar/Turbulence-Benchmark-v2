  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n```python\ndef sum_odd_ints_inclusive(num_list):\n    if not any(num % 2 for num in num_list[25:60]):\n        return 0\n    return sum(num for num in num_list[25:60] if num % 2)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The function checks if there are any odd numbers in the list between indexes 25 and 59.\n* If there are no odd numbers in that range, the function returns 0. This is done using the `any()` function and a generator expression.\n* If there are odd numbers in that range, the function returns the sum of all odd numbers in that range. This is done using the `sum()` function and a generator expression."
