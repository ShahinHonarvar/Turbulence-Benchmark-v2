The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 527 to index 538, both inclusive.
