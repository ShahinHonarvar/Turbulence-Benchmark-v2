  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 64 to index 66, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(int_list):\n          odd_nums = 0\n          for num in int_list[64:67]:\n            if num % 2 != 0:\n              odd_nums += num\n          return odd_nums if odd_nums else 0\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the specified range of elements in the input list (`int_list[64:67]`).\n\nInside the loop, it checks if the current element is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the element is odd, its value is added to a variable called `odd_nums`.\n\nIf no odd elements are found within the specified range, the loop will not execute, and the final value of `odd_nums` will be 0."
