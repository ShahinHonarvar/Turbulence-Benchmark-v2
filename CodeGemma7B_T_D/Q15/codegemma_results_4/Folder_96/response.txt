  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 50 to index 200, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    sum_odd = 0\n    for i in range(50, 201):\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            sum_odd += nums[i]\n    return sum_odd if sum_odd else 0\n```\n\nThis code defines a Python function called `sum_odd_ints_inclusive`. It takes one argument, `nums`, which is a list of integers. The function iterates through the elements of the list from index 50 to index 200, inclusive. It checks if each element is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If an element is odd, the function adds its value to the `sum_odd` variable. Finally, the function returns the value of `sum_odd`. If `sum_odd` is 0, it means that no odd elements were found in the specified range, and the function returns 0 instead."
