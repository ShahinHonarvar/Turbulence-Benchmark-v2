  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 28 to index 38, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    \"\"\"Sums odd ints inclusive.\"\"\"\n    odd_sum = 0\n    for i in range(28, 39):\n        if nums[i] % 2 != 0:\n            odd_sum += nums[i]\n    if odd_sum == 0:\n        return 0\n    return odd_sum\n        ```\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function takes a list of integers as input.\n* It initializes a variable `odd_sum` to 0.\n* It iterates over the list from index 28 to 38, both inclusive.\n* For each element in the list, it checks if it is odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder (when divided by 2) is not 0, it is an odd integer.\n* If the element is odd, it is added to the `odd_sum` variable.\n* After the iteration, the function checks if `odd_sum` is 0. If it is, it means there were no odd integers in the specified range, so it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns `odd_sum` to represent the sum of all odd integers in the specified range."
