  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 31 to index 72, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(31, 73):\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            sum += nums[i]\n    return sum\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code starts with a function definition that takes a single argument, `nums`, which represents a list of integers. It initializes a variable `sum` to zero.\n\nThe code then enters a `for` loop that iterates from 31 to 72, inclusive. This loop checks each index in the list of integers to see if it falls within the specified range.\n\nInside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `i` is odd, it adds the corresponding integer at that index from the list `nums` to the `sum`.\n\nFinally, the loop continues until it reaches the end of the range, and the function returns the accumulated `sum`. If no odd integers fall within the specified range, the loop will not execute, and the function will return 0."
