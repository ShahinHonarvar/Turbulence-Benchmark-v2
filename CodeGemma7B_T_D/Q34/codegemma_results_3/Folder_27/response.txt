  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_original_set\' that takes exactly 100 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef find_original_set(sets):\n    return reduce(lambda a, b: a & b, sets)\n```\nThis code defines a function `find_original_set` that takes a list of sets as input and returns the smallest set that contains all the sets in the input list. The code uses the `reduce` function to iteratively find the intersection of all the sets in the input list. The `&` operator is used to find the intersection of two sets. The `reduce` function takes three arguments: the function to apply to the elements, the initial value, and the iterable. In this case, the function to apply is the intersection operator, the initial value is the first set in the input list, and the iterable is the input list itself. The result of the `reduce` operation is the smallest set that contains all the sets in the input list.\n\nThis code does not contain any comments, as requested in the prompt."
