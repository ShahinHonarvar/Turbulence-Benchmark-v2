  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_original_set\' that takes exactly 41 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is a proposed answer:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(s0, s1, s2, ..., s40):\n  for i in range(min_common_length, s0):\n    if s0.issubset(s) and s1.issubset(s) and ... and s40.issubset(s):\n      return s\n```\n\nwhere min_common_length is the minimum length among the 41 given sets."
