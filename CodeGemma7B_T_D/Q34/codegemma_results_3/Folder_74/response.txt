The Python code should not contain any comments.

The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\n<The function should return the smallest set that includes all of the sets passed as arguments. That is, if some argument A is a subset of argument B, then A should not be included in the returned set.
