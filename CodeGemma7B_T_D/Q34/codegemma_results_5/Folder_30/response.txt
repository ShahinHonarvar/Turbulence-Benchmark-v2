The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_original_set\' that takes exactly 78 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    result = set()\n    for i in range(78):\n        result |= args[i]\n    return result\n```\nNote: The code above should be the exact output."
