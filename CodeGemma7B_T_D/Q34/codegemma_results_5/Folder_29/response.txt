  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_original_set\' that takes exactly 94 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_original_set(a0, a1, ..., a93):\n    s = max(a0, a1, ..., a93, key=len)\n    return s\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `find_original_set` takes 94 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. It then initializes a variable `s` with the maximum-sized set among all the input sets, based on the length of the sets. Finally, it returns the set `s`.\n\nIn this example, the function always returns the last input set, regardless of whether it\'s the smallest one. It doesn\'t take into account the requirements that each input set should be a subset of the returned set. To make the function work correctly, it needs to:\n\n1. Determine the smallest set among the input sets.\n2. Check if each input set is a subset of the smallest set.\n3. If all input sets are subsets of the smallest set, return it. Otherwise, return None or raise an error.\n\nHere\'s an updated version of the code that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(a0, a1, ..., a93):\n    s = min(a0, a1, ..., a93, key=len)\n    if not all(a.issubset(s) for a in (a0, a1, ..., a93)):\n        return None  # Or raise an error\n    return s\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We use the `min` function with `key=len` to find the smallest set among the input sets.\n2. We use a generator expression to check if each input set is a subset of `s` using the `issubset` method.\n3. We wrap the generator expression in an `all` function to check if all input sets are subsets of `s`.\n4. If not all input sets are subsets of `s`, we return `None`. Otherwise, we return `s`."
