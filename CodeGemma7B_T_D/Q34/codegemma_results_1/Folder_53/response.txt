  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_original_set\' that takes exactly 84 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n  \"\"\"\n  Finds the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.\n  \"\"\"\n  result = set()\n  for arg in args:\n    result.update(arg)\n  return result\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `find_original_set` function takes an arbitrary number of arguments using the star (*) operator.\n* Each argument is expected to be a set of integers.\n* The `result` variable stores the smallest set that includes all the elements from the input sets.\n* The `update` method updates the `result` set with elements from each input set.\n* The function returns the `result` set, which represents the smallest set that contains all the subsets."
