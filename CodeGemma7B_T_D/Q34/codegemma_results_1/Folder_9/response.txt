  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_original_set\' that takes exactly 73 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*args):\n    if len(args) != 73:\n        raise ValueError(\"The function must take exactly 73 arguments\")\n    \n    original_set = None\n    for arg in args:\n        if original_set is None:\n            original_set = set(arg)\n        else:\n            original_set.update(arg)\n\n    return original_set\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function `find_original_set` takes an indefinite number of arguments using the `*` operator.\n2. It checks if the number of arguments is exactly 73 and raises a `ValueError` if not.\n3. If there are exactly 73 arguments, it initializes `original_set` with the first argument and iterates through the remaining arguments.\n4. For each argument, it updates `original_set` with the elements of the argument.\n5. Finally, the function returns `original_set`, which is the smallest set that contains all the subsets of the given arguments."
