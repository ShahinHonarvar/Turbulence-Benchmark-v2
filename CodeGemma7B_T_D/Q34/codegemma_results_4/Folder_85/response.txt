  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_original_set\' that takes exactly 85 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_original_set(a0, a1, a2, ..., a84):\n  unified_set = set()\n  for i in range(85):\n    unified_set.update(eval(\"a\" + str(i)))\n  return min(unified_set, key = len)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `find_original_set` takes exactly 85 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers.\n* It initializes an empty set called `unified_set`.\n* It iterates through the arguments from `a0` to `a84` (inclusive) using a `for` loop.\n* For each argument, it updates the `unified_set` by adding the elements of the set to it using the `update()` method.\n* Finally, it returns the smallest set in `unified_set` based on its length using the `min()` function and a lambda expression that specifies the length of each set as the key."
