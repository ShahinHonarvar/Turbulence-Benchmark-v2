  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_original_set\' that takes exactly 53 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_original_set(arg0, arg1, ..., arg52):\n    sets = [arg0, arg1, ..., arg52]\n    max_len = max(len(s) for s in sets)\n    return next(s for s in sets if len(s) == max_len)\n```\nAs the user input could be more than just the arguments, the code should be delimited only by triple backticks."
