  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_original_set\' that takes exactly 64 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef find_original_set(sets):\n  original_set = set()\n  for elements in product(*sets):\n    new_set = set(elements)\n    if all(s.issubset(new_set) for s in sets):\n      if not original_set or len(new_set) < len(original_set):\n        original_set = new_set\n  return original_set\n```\nIn this code, product(*sets) returns an iterator of all possible combinations of the sets, and we iterate through those combinations. For each combination, we create a new set and check if all of the given sets are subsets of that new set. If they are, we update the original_set to the new set if it\'s smaller than the current one."
