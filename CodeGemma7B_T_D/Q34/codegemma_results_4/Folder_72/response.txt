  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_original_set\' that takes exactly 87 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here\'s the Python code for that task:\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\n\nsets = [set(range(i)) for i in range(1, 88)]  # List of all sets of integers up to 87\n\ndef find_original_set(sets):\n  original_set = reduce(lambda a, b: a & b, sets)  # Find the intersection of all sets\n  return original_set\n```"
