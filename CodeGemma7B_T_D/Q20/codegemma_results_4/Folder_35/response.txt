  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_n_th_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 6th smallest number from index 12 to index 60, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(list_of_numbers):\n  list_of_numbers.sort()\n  return list_of_numbers[11:61][5]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `sort()` method sorts the input list in ascending order.\n* We slice the sorted list from index 11 (inclusive) to index 61 (inclusive) using list slicing.\n* The `[]` operator extracts the element at index 5 from the sliced list.\n* The final result is returned by the function."
