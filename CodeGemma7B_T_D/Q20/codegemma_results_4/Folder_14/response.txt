  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_n_th_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 6th smallest number from index 2 to index 9, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(num_list):\n    return sorted(num_list)[2:10:2][5]\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\nIn this solution, the `find_n_th_smallest_num` function:\n\n1. Sorts the input list using the built-in `sorted()` function.\n2. Extracts a slice from the sorted list containing elements from index 2 to index 9, inclusive, using the syntax `[2:10]` with a step value of 2 (to skip every second element).\n3. Returns the 6th element from the sliced list using indexing at index 5.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function returns the 6th smallest number from the specified range while avoiding unnecessary loops or sorting algorithms."
