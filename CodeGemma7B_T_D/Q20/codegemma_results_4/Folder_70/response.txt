  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_n_th_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 4th smallest number from index 26 to index 90, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    return sorted(nums[26:91])[3]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `find_n_th_smallest_num` function takes a list of distinct numbers as input.\n* We slice the list to extract the numbers from index 26 to index 90, inclusive. This is done using `nums[26:91]`.\n* We then sort the sliced list using the `sorted()` function.\n* The third element in the sorted list (index 2) corresponds to the 4th smallest number in the original list. We return this element."
