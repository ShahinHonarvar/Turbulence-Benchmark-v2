The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_n_th_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 8th smallest number from index 0 to index 7, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    return sorted(nums)[7]\n```\n<The explanation is that the sorted() function sorts the numbers in ascending order, and since the 8th smallest number is at index 7 in the sorted list, we return the value at that index.>"
