  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_n_th_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 11th smallest number from index 18 to index 38, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n  nums.sort()\n  return nums[17:39][10]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The `sort()` function sorts the list of numbers in ascending order.\n- The `nums[17:39]` slicing operator extracts a sublist containing elements from index 18 to 38, inclusive.\n- The `[10]` indexing operator selects the 11th element from the sublist, which is the desired 11th smallest number."
