  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_n_th_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 6th smallest number from index 50 to index 81, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):\n    return sorted(nums[50:82])[5]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `find_n_th_smallest_num` takes a list of distinct numbers `nums` as input.\n* The function uses list slicing `[50:82]` to extract a sublist from index 50 to 81, inclusive.\n* The function sorts the sublist using the `sorted()` function.\n* The function returns the 6th element from the sorted sublist, which represents the 6th smallest number from index 50 to index 81, inclusive."
