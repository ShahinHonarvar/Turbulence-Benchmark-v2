  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_n_th_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 5th smallest number from index 2 to index 8, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n\nfrom functools import cmp_to_key\n\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(num_list):\n    def custom_sort(num1, num2):\n        return num1 - num2\n\n    sorted_nums = sorted(num_list[2:9], key=cmp_to_key(custom_sort))\n    return sorted_nums[4]\n\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The `functools` module is used to convert the custom sorting function to a key function for the `sorted()` function.\n- The slicing operation `num_list[2:9]` extracts elements from index 2 (inclusive) to index 8 (inclusive) from the input list.\n- The `key` argument in `sorted()` specifies the custom sorting function `custom_sort()`.\n- The result is returned as the fifth element from the sorted sublist, which represents the 5th smallest number within the specified range."
