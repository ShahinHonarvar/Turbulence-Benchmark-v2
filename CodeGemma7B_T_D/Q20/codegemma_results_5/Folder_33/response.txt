  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_n_th_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 8th smallest number from index 213 to index 322, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(num_list):\n    sorted_list = sorted(num_list[213:322])\n    return sorted_list[6]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 8th smallest number from index 213 to index 322, both inclusive. It first sorts the list from smallest to largest using the `sorted()` function, and then returns the 6th element from the sorted list. The index of the 8th smallest number is 6, since we are starting from index 213."
