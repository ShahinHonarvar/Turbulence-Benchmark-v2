  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_n_th_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 15th smallest number from index 46 to index 83, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\n        def find_n_th_smallest_num(num_list):\n            num_list = num_list[46:84]\n            return sorted(num_list)[14]\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `find_n_th_smallest_num` takes a list of distinct numbers as input.\n* The input list is sliced to extract numbers from index 46 to 83, inclusive.\n* The `sorted()` function is applied to the sliced list to sort the numbers in ascending order.\n* The 15th element from the sorted list is returned."
