  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_n_th_smallest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 6th smallest number from index 50 to index 81, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_n_th_smallest_num(num_list):\n    sorted_lst = sorted(num_list)\n    return sorted_lst[50:82][4]\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function `find_n_th_smallest_num()` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It sorts the input list using the `sorted()` function.\n3. It slices the sorted list from index 50 to 81, both inclusive, using the list slicing operation `sorted_lst[50:82]`.\n4. It returns the 5th element from the sliced list, which corresponds to the 6th smallest number from index 50 to index 81."
