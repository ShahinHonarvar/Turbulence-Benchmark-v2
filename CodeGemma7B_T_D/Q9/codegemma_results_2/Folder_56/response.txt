The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nHere are two examples of the function in use:\n        ```python\n        # Case 1: The list contains even and odd integers in the range 0 to 0.\n        assert all_odd_ints_inclusive([2, 4, 6, 8, 10], 0, 0) == []\n\n        # Case 2: The list contains only odd integers in the range 0 to 0.\n        assert all_odd_ints_inclusive([1, 3, 5, 7, 9], 0, 0) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n        ```\n\n```python\ndef all_odd_ints_inclusive(nums, start_index, end_index):\n    return [num for num in nums[start_index:end_index + 1] if num % 2 != 0]\n```"
