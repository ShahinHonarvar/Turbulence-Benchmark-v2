  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 25 to index 87, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n\\begin{code}\n        python\n        ```python\n        # Your code goes here.\n        ```\n        \\end{code}\n        ```\n\n```python\ndef all_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return [i for i in nums[25:88] if i % 2 != 0]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function takes a list of integers as input.\n* It uses slicing to get a sublist of elements from index 25 to index 87, inclusive.\n* A list comprehension is used to iterate over the sublist and extract elements that meet the condition of being odd using the modulo operator (%).\n* If no odd integers are found within the specified range, an empty list is returned."
