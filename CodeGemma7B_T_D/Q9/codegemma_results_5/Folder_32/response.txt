The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 21 to index 97, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n          [23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97]\n        ```\n\n**Note:** Since there\'s no pattern or complex logic in this example, we can use list comprehension and perform the filtering within a single line.\n\n```python\n[x for x in range(21, 98)[::2]]\n```"
