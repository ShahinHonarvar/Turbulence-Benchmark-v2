  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 0 to index 2, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nOutput: ```python\n        def all_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):\n          if not lst or lst[0]%2==0 or lst[-1]%2==0:\n            return []\n          return lst[::2]\n        ```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function checks for an empty list or if the first or last element is even. If either condition is true, it indicates that there are no odd numbers in the specified range, so it returns an empty list.\n* If the list is not empty and both the first and last elements are odd, the function returns a list containing only the odd elements at even indices (since indexing starts at 0). This is done using list slicing `lst[::2]`.\n* The indexing allows the function to include the first and last odd numbers in the returned list, as specified in the problem."
