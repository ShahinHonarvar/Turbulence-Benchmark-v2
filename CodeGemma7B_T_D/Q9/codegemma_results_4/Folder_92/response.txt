  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 0 to index 1, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\ndef all_odd_ints_inclusive(int_list):\n    odd_list = []\n    for num in int_list:\n        if num % 2 != 0:\n            odd_list.append(num)\n    return odd_list\n```\n        System: The provided code snippet solves the problem by using a simple for loop to iterate over the input list, checking if each element is an odd integer using the modulo operator. If an odd integer is found, it is appended to a new list called odd_list. Finally, the odd_list is returned after iterating through the entire list."
