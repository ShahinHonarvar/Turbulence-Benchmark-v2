The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 30 to index 87, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):\n            \"\"\"\n            Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 30 to index 87, both inclusive.
