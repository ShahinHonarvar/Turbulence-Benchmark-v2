  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_neg_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 56 to index 82, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_neg_ints_inclusive(in_list):\n            for i in in_list[56:83]:\n                if i >= 0:\n                    continue\n                out_list.append(i)\n            return out_list\n        ```\n\n*Note:* The above output is the expected output for the code provided by the user. However, the code will not work as expected because `out_list` is not defined in the function. To make it work, the code needs to be modified as follows:\n```python\ndef all_neg_ints_inclusive(in_list):\n    out_list = []\n    for i in in_list[56:83]:\n        if i >= 0:\n            continue\n        out_list.append(i)\n    return out_list\n```"
