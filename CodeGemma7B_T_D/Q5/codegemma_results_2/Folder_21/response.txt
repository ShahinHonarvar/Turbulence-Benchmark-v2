  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_neg_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 639 to index 975, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n\"\"\"\n        ```python\n        def all_neg_ints_inclusive(nums):\n            return [num for num in nums[639:976] if num < 0]\n        ```\n        \"\"\"\n\nThis is the correct answer. Here\'s why:\n\n* The function signature `def all_neg_ints_inclusive(nums):` defines a function named `all_neg_ints_inclusive` that takes a single argument called `nums`.\n* The function uses a list comprehension `[num for num in nums[639:976] if num < 0]` to create a list of negative integers.\n    * `num` is the iterator variable that refers to each element in the sliced list `nums[639:976]`.\n    * `num < 0` is the condition that filters out elements that are not negative.\n* The filtered list is returned by the function. If the list remains empty, it means that there are no negative numbers within the specified range.\n\nI hope this explanation is helpful!"
