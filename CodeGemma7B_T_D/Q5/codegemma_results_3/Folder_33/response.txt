  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_neg_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 667 to index 774, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_neg_ints_inclusive(nums):\n            return [num for num in nums[667:775] if num <= 0]\n        ```\n         This code defines a function, `all_neg_ints_inclusive`, which uses list slicing to iterate through a given list of integers from index 667 to index 774, inclusive. The function then uses a list comprehension to filter out all negative numbers and return them as a new list. If there are no negative numbers in the specified range, an empty list will be returned."
