  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_neg_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 42 to index 68, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef all_neg_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[42:69] if num <= 0]\n```\n## Explanation\n\nThis code defines a function `all_neg_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as input.\n\nIt then uses list comprehension to filter the elements in the list `nums` from index `42` to `68` (inclusive) based on the condition `num <= 0`.\n\nThis condition ensures that only negative integers are included in the result list.\n\nFinally, the result list is returned, which will either contain the negative integers within the specified range, or an empty list if none exist."
