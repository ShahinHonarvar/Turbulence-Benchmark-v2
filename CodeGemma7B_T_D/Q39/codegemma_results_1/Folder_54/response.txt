  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_n_greatest_chars\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates the sorted list of exactly 79 characters of the given string that have the greatest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in descending order and returns it.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code:\n```python\ndef return_n_greatest_chars(string):\n    characters = sorted(string, key=ord, reverse=True)[:79]\n    return characters\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function `return_n_greatest_chars` takes a string as input.\n\n2. We create a list of characters sorted in descending order of their ASCII values using `sorted()` with `key=ord` and `reverse=True`.\n\n3. We slice the list to include only the first 79 characters.\n\n4. The function returns the sorted list of characters."
