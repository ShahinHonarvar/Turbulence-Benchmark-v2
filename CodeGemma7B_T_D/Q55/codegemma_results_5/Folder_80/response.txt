  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'lists_with_product_equal_n\' that takes an argument, a circular list of integers. In a circular list, the head and the tail are adjacent to each other to form a circle. The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 43. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import islice\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    def product(iter_):\n        s = 1\n        for element in iter_:\n            s *= element\n        return s\n\n    for sublist_size in range(2, len(circular_list) + 1):\n        for i in range(len(circular_list) - sublist_size + 1):\n            sublist = circular_list[i: i + sublist_size]\n            if product(sublist) == 43:\n                return sublist\n\n    return []\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `lists_with_product_equal_n` function takes a circular list as input and returns a list of sublists that have a product equal to 43.\n\nThe `product()` function calculates the product of the elements in any provided iterator.\n\nA nested loop iterates over possible sublist sizes, starting from size 2 and up to the size of the input list. For each sublist size, the outer loop iterates over possible starting positions within the circular list.\n\nThe `circular_list[i: i + sublist_size]` slice extracts a sublist of the specified size starting at the current `i` position. The `product()` function is called on the sublist to calculate its product.\n\nIf the product is equal to 43, the function returns the sublist.\n\nIf no sublist with a product equal to 43 is found for the given sublist size, the loop continues to the next size. If no sublist is found for any size, the function returns an empty list.\n\n**Note:** The code does not handle duplicate sublists. If the input list contains duplicate elements, the returned list may include duplicate sublists."
