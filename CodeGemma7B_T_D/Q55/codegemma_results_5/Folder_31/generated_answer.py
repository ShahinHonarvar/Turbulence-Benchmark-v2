    Write a function called 'lists_with_product_equal_n' that takes an argument,
    a circular list of integers. In a circular list, the head and the tail are
    adjacent to each other to form a circle. The function should return a list of
    sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such
    that their product equals -16. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any
    size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no
    such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are
    duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list.
    The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.
