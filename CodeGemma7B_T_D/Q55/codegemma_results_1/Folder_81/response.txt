The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'lists_with_product_equal_n\' that takes an argument, a circular list of integers. In a circular list, the head and the tail are adjacent to each other to form a circle. The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -8. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Triangles with a side length of 10 are equilateral. Python code to display such triangles of side length n is provided as an example. An equilateral triangle with side length n has side length 2n and height n. Base case n = 1 is also present.\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes an argument, a circular list of integers.\n    In a circular list, the head and the tail are adjacent to each other to form a circle.\n    The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -8.\n    Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list.\n    If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list.

These products will be used to efficiently compute the product of any sublist starting at or ending at `i`.\n5. **Target product:** Set the target product to -8 and look for products that are multiples of this target. This condition indicates that the product of the sublist is -8.\n6. **Window adjustment:** If the product is not a multiple of -8, adjust the window size and repeat steps 3-6.\n7. **Sublist extraction:** If a sublist of length smaller than or equal to 4 satisfies the product condition, extract it and add it to the result list.\n\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes an argument, a circular list of integers.\n    In a circular list, the head and the tail are adjacent to each other to form a circle.\n    The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -8.\n    Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list.\n    If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list.
