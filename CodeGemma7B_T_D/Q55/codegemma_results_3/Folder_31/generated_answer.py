    """
  Write a function called 'lists_with_product_equal_n' that takes an argument,
  a circular list of integers. In a circular list, the head and the tail are
  adjacent to each other to form a circle. The function should return a list of
  sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list
  such that their product equals -16. Each sublist in the returned list can be of
  any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list.
  If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are
  duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list.
  The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.
