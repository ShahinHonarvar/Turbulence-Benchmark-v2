  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'lists_with_product_equal_n\' that takes an argument, a circular list of integers. In a circular list, the head and the tail are adjacent to each other to form a circle. The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 5. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(cyclic_list):\n  products = deque()\n  current_product = 1\n  for num in cyclic_list:\n    current_product *= num\n    products.append(current_product)\n  outcomes = []\n  for size, product in enumerate(products):\n    if product % 5 == 0:\n      for sublist_size in range(1, size + 1):\n        for i in range(size - sublist_size + 1):\n          sublist = cyclic_list[i: i + sublist_size]\n          if product // current_product == cyclic_list[(i - 1) % len(cyclic_list)] and product // current_product == cyclic_list[(i + sublist_size) % len(cyclic_list)]:\n            outcomes.append(sublist)\n  return outcomes\n```"
