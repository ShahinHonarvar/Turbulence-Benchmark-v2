  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'lists_with_product_equal_n\' that takes an argument, a circular list of integers. In a circular list, the head and the tail are adjacent to each other to form a circle. The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 13. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    sublists = []\n    for i in range(len(circular_list)):\n        product = circular_list[i]\n        sublist = [circular_list[i]]\n        j = (i + 1) % len(circular_list)\n        while j != i:\n            product *= circular_list[j]\n            sublist.append(circular_list[j])\n            if product == 13:\n                sublists.append(sublist[:])\n            j = (j + 1) % len(circular_list)\n            product = sublist[-1]\n            if product > 13:\n                break\n    return sublists\n\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `lists_with_product_equal_n` that takes an argument, a circular list of integers. The `for` loop iterates over each element in the list. For each element, it calculates the product of the consecutive integers from that element. If the product equals 13, the sublist is added to the `sublists` list. The `while` loop continues moving forward in the circular list until it reaches the original element, at which point the product is reset and the search continues. The `[]` operator is used to create a copy of the `sublist` list, so that the original list is not modified."
