  This function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists
  such that their product equals -95. The sublists can be of any size as long as they are
  smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the
  function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist,
  they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned
  list does not matter.
