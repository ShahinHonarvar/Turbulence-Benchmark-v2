The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'lists_with_product_equal_n\' that takes an argument, a circular list of integers. In a circular list, the head and the tail are adjacent to each other to form a circle. The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 90. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list.

The time complexity arises from the nested loops, where the outer loop iterates over each element in the list, and the inner loop iterates over the remaining elements in the list. In the worst case, the inner loop may have to iterate through the entire list (n times) for each element in the outer loop (n times), resulting in a total of n^2 iterations.\n\nOther observations:\n1. The code uses a Circular List representation, where the head and tail are adjacent to each other. This means that the list can be represented as a set of elements wrapped around on themselves, and the element after the last element in the list is the first element in the list.\n2. The code uses a flag variable j to keep track of the current element being considered in the inner loop. The variable j is initialized to (i+1) % len(circ_list), which means that it will start at the next element in the list (after the element at index i).\n3. The code uses a temp_list variable to store the contiguous elements from the circular list that have a product equal to 90. The temp_list is initialized with the element at index i, and the inner loop iterates over the remaining elements in the list. If the current element times the last element in temp_list is equal to 90, the current element is appended to temp_list, and the variable j is updated to point to the next element in the list. If the current element times the last element in temp_list is not equal to 90, the temp_list is reset and the inner loop continues to the next element in the list.\n4. The code uses a result variable to store the list of sublists that have a product equal to 90. The result list is initialized as an empty list, and the outer loop iterates over each element in the circular list. If a sublist is found that has a product equal to 90, it is appended to the result list.\n5. The code does not handle duplicates of sublists. A sublist is appended to the result list if it is not already in the result list. This means that if there are multiple sublists with a product equal to 90, only the first sublist that is encountered with that product will be appended to the result list."
