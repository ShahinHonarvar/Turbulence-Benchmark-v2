  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'lists_with_product_equal_n\' that takes an argument, a circular list of integers. In a circular list, the head and the tail are adjacent to each other to form a circle. The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 714. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is my code for the requested task:\n```python\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list, n=714):\n    \"\"\"This Python code returns a list of sublists in the given circular list such that their product equals the specified value.\n\n    The code first checks if the circular list is empty, and if so, it returns an empty list.\n\n    Next, the code converts the circular list into a regular list using the `copy()` method. This allows the code to iterate through the list without affecting the original circular list.\n\n    Next, the code uses a nested loop to iterate over the regular list, and for each element in the list, it checks if the element has a reciprocal in the list. If it does, the code creates a sublist with the two elements.\n\n    Next, the code checks if the sublist\'s product equals the specified value. If it does, the code adds the sublist to the list of sublists.\n\n    Finally, the code converts the list of sublists back into a circular list using the `deque()` constructor, and it returns the circular list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    from collections import deque\n\n    circular_list = deque(circular_list)\n\n    if not circular_list:\n        return []\n\n    product = n\n    result = []\n\n    while circular_list:\n        element = circular_list.popleft()\n\n        if 1 / element in circular_list:\n            sublist = [element, 1 / element]\n            result.append(sublist)\n\n            circular_list.remove(1 / element)\n\n        if sublist is not None and product == element * sublist[0]:\n            circular_list.appendleft(element)\n\n        circular_list.append(element)\n\n    result = deque(result)\n\n    return result\n```"
