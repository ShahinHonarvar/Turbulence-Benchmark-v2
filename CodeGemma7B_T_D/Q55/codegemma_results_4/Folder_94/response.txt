  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'lists_with_product_equal_n\' that takes an argument, a circular list of integers. In a circular list, the head and the tail are adjacent to each other to form a circle. The function should return a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -30. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import islice\n\ndef lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):\n    list_size = len(circular_list)\n    for i in range(list_size):\n        sublist = list(islice(circular_list, i, i + list_size))\n        product = 1\n        for element in sublist:\n            product *= element\n        if product == -30:\n            return sublist\n    return []\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `lists_with_product_equal_n()` function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists with a product of -30. The function uses a sliding window approach to iterate over the list. For each starting position `i`, it creates a sublist `sublist` using the `islice()` function from the itertools module. It then calculates the product of the elements in `sublist` and checks if it is equal to -30. If a sublist with a product of -30 is found, the function returns it. Otherwise, it continues iterating until the end of the list. If no sublist with a product of -30 is found, the function returns an empty list."
