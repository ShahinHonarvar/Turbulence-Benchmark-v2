The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_of_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 8 and 9, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n            total = 0\n            for divisor in range(8, 10):\n                if n % divisor == 0:\n                    total += divisor\n            return total\n        ```\nThis is a simple function that will iterate over the numbers from 8 to 10 and check if they are divisors of the given number. If they are, the function will add them to the sum. If no divisors are found in the specified range, the function will return 0."
