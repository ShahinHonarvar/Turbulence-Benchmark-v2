  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_of_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 6 and 7, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(num):\n  sum = 0\n  for i in range(6, 8):\n    if num % i == 0:\n      sum += i\n  if sum == 0:\n    return 0\n  return sum\n\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\n1. The function `sum_of_divisors_in_range` takes a positive integer `num` as input.\n2. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0.\n3. The `for` loop iterates from 6 to 7, inclusive.\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if `num` is divisible by the current `i` value.\n5. If the condition in the `if` statement is true, it adds the current `i` value to the `sum` variable.\n6. After the loop, it checks if `sum` is still 0.\n7. If `sum` is 0, it means there are no divisors in the specified range. So, it returns 0.\n8. Otherwise, it returns the `sum` value."
