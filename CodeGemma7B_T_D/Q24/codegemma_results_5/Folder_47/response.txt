  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_of_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 27 and 44, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def sum_of_divisors_in_range(num):\n            sum_of_div = 0\n            for divisor in range(27, 45):\n                if num % divisor == 0:\n                    sum_of_div += divisor\n            if sum_of_div == 0:\n                return 0\n            else:\n                return sum_of_div\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code defines a function `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a single argument, which is the number for which we need to find the sum of divisors. Inside the function:\n\n```python\n    sum_of_div = 0\n```\nHere, we initialize `sum_of_div` to 0. This variable will be used to store the sum as we iterate over the divisors.\n\n```python\n    for divisor in range(27, 45):\n```\nIn this line, we use a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers from 27 to 44 (inclusive). These numbers represent the possible divisors we need to check for the given number.\n\n```python\n        if num % divisor == 0:\n            sum_of_div += divisor\n```\nInside the loop, we check if the given number is divisible by the current `divisor`. If it is, we add the `divisor` to the `sum_of_div`.\n\n```python\n    if sum_of_div == 0:\n        return 0\n```\nAfter iterating over all numbers in the range, we check if the `sum_of_div` is 0. If it is, it means there are no divisors in the specified range, so we return 0.\n\n```python\n    else:\n        return sum_of_div\n```\nIf we find at least one divisor in the range, we return the `sum_of_div` as the result."
