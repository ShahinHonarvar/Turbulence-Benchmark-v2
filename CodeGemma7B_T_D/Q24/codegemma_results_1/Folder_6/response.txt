The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_of_divisors_in_range\' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 58 and 90, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(58, 91):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            sum += i\n    if sum == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return sum\n```\n        This code uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 58 to 90, checking if each number divides `n` evenly. If it does, the function adds that number to a running sum. Finally, if the sum is still 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the sum."
