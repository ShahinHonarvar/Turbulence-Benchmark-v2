The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'submatrix_with_n_numbers\' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 51 integers each.

It will also return the count of submatrices that have the same number of zeros and ones and has 49 integers. The user is only interested in the submatrices with 51 integers so the code should be modified to only return the count of submatrices with 51 integers."
