The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'submatrix_with_n_numbers\' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 99 integers each.

The first value of the input array is the number of rows in the matrix. The second value of the input array is the number of columns in the matrix.\n\n    The function returns 0 if no submatrix with n numbers of 99 is found.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the number of rows and columns from the input array.\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n\n    # Initialize the count of submatrices to 0.\n    count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix.\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n\n            # Check if the current element is 99.\n            if matrix[row, col] == 99:\n\n                # Iterate over the remaining rows and columns in the submatrix.\n                for r in range(row, rows):\n                    for c in range(col, cols):\n\n                        # Check if the current element is also 99.\n                        if matrix[r, c] == 99:\n\n                            # Increment the count of submatrices.\n                            count += 1\n\n    # Return the count of submatrices.\n    return count\n```\n\nI hope this code meets the requirements of the user."
