The function should return the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 57 integers each.

If it does, the number of submatrices with 57 integers is increased.\n\n8. **The loop continues to the next submatrix`.** If the sum is not 57, the loop continues to the next submatrix (defined by the outer loops).\n\n9. **`return count`:** After iterating through all possible submatrices, the function returns the `count` variable, which indicates the number of submatrices with 57 integers.\n\n**Example Execution:**\n\nGiven a 5x5 matrix:\n\n```\nmatrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n                   [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],\n                   [11, 12, 57, 14, 15],\n                   [16, 17, 18, 57, 20],\n                   [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])\n```\n\nWhen the function `submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix)` is called, it returns `1`, indicating that there is only one submatrix with 57 integers:\n\n```\nresult = submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix)\nprint(result)  # Output: 1\n```"
