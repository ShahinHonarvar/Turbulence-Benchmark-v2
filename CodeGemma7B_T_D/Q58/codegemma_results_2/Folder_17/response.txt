  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'submatrix_with_n_numbers\' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 166 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        import numpy as np\n\n        def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n            return np.count_nonzero((matrix >= 166).sum(axis=1) == 2)\n        ```\n\nThis code works because we use the following logic:\n\n* We first create a boolean mask by checking if each element in the matrix is greater than or equal to 166. This boolean mask will be of the same shape as the matrix, with True values where the element is greater than or equal to 166 and False values otherwise.\n* We then sum the elements along axis 1 of the boolean mask. This will give us a new matrix with the same number of rows as the original matrix, but with only one column. Each element in this new matrix will represent the count of the number of 166s in a row in the original matrix.\n* Finally, we use the `np.count_nonzero()` function to count the number of elements in this new matrix that are equal to 2. This gives us the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 166 integers each.\n\nIf no such submatrix is found, the function will return 0. This is because the `np.count_nonzero()` function will return 0 in this case, and we will return that value as our result."
