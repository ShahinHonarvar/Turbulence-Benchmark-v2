  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -90 or -59 from index 51 to index 76, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(51, 77):\n        if nums[i] % -90 == 0 or nums[i] % -59 == 0:\n            total += nums[i]\n    return total\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` takes a list of integers as input and calculates the sum of all integers in the range [51, 76] that are divisible by either -90 or -59.\n\nTwo nested loops are employed to iterate through the list of integers from index 51 to index 76, both inclusive.\n\nInside the loop, the modulo operator (%) is used to check if the integer at index `i` is divisible by either -90 or -59. If the remainder is zero, it indicates that the integer satisfies the condition, and it is added to the `total` variable.\n\nIf no integers are found to satisfy the condition, the `total` variable remains as 0, and the function returns 0 as specified."
