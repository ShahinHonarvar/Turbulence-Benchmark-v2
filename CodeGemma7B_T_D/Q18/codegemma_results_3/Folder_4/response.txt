  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -71 or -67 from index 86 to index 90, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):\n    filtered_nums = [num for num in nums[86:91] if num % (-71) == 0 or num % (-67) == 0]\n    return sum(filtered_nums, 0) if filtered_nums else 0\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` takes a list of integers `nums` as input.\n- It slices the list `nums` from index 86 to 90 (inclusive) and stores it in the `filtered_nums` list.\n- The list comprehension iterates over `filtered_nums` and checks if each number is divisible by -71 or -67 using the modulus operator (`%`).\n- If a number is divisible by either -71 or -67, it is added to the `filtered_nums` list.\n- The `sum()` function sums the elements of the `filtered_nums` list, starting with an initial value of 0.\n- If `filtered_nums` is empty, it means there are no integers divisible by either -71 or -67 in the specified range. In this case, the function returns 0."
