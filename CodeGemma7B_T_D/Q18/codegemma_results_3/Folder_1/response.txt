The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -61 or -64 from index 10 to index 28, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\n        def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):\n            nums = nums[10:29]\n            total = 0\n            for num in nums:\n                if num % -61 == 0 or num % -64 == 0:\n                    total += num\n            return total if total else 0\n        ```\n\nHere is a breakdown of the code:\n\n- The `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` function takes a list of integers as input.\n- It slices the input list from index 10 to index 28 (inclusive) and updates the `nums` variable to store the sliced elements.\n- It initializes a variable called `total` to 0.\n- It iterates through each element in the `nums` list.\n- For each element, it checks if it is divisible by either -61 or -64 using the modulo operator.\n- If the element is divisible, it adds its value to the `total` variable.\n- After iterating through all elements, it returns the `total` variable. If the `total` variable is 0, it returns 0 instead."
