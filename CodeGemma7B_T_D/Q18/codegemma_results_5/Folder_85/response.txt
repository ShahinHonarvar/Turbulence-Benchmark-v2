  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -9 or -3 from index 1 to index 8, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, 9):\n        if nums[i] % 9 == 0 or nums[i] % 3 == 0:\n            sum += nums[i]\n    return sum\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` takes one argument, a list of integers named `nums`.\n- It initializes a variable `sum` to store the sum of integers divisible by either -9 or -3.\n- It uses a `for` loop to iterate through the elements of the `nums` list from index 1 to index 8, both inclusive.\n- Inside the loop, the code checks if the current element `nums[i]` is divisible by 9 or 3 using the modulo operator (`%`).\n- If the element is divisible by either -9 or -3, it adds it to the `sum` variable.\n- Finally, after iterating through the entire list, the function returns the `sum` value. If no elements are divisible by -9 or -3, the `sum` variable will remain 0."
