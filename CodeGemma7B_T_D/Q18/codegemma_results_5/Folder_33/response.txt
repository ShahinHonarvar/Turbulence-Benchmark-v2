  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -722 or -731 from index 281 to index 694, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):\n                result = 0\n                for i in range(281, 695):\n                    if nums[i] % -722 == 0 or nums[i] % -731 == 0:\n                        result += nums[i]\n                return result or 0\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` takes a list of integers as input.\n* The variable `result` is initialized to 0.\n* A `for` loop iterates from index 281 to 694 (inclusive).\n* Inside the `for` loop, it checks if the current integer is divisible by -722 or -731.\n* If the integer is divisible by either number, the `result` variable is incremented by the integer\'s value.\n* If no integers are divisible by -722 or -731 in the specified range, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the accumulated `result` value."
