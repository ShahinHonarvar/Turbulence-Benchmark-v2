  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -92 or -50 from index 20 to index 93, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n               def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(num_list):\n                    total = 0\n                    for i in range(20, 94):\n                        if num_list[i] % 92 == 0 or num_list[i] % 50 == 0:\n                            total += num_list[i]\n                    if not total:\n                        return 0\n                    return total\n        ```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` takes a list of integers as input and returns an integer.\n* It initializes a variable `total` to store the sum of integers divisible by either -92 or -50.\n* It iterates through the list from index 20 to 93, inclusive.\n* For each element in the list, it checks if it is divisible by 92 or 50 using the modulo operator.\n* If the element is divisible by either -92 or -50, it adds it to the `total` variable.\n* After iterating through the entire list, it checks if the `total` variable is empty.\n* If the `total` variable is empty, it means no integers in the specified range are divisible by either -92 or -50, so it returns 0.\n* Otherwise, it returns the `total` variable."
