  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -27 or -96 from index 36 to index 85, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\n\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):\n    value = 0 \n    for num in nums[36:86]:\n        if num % 27 == 0 or num % 96 == 0:\n            value += num\n    return value\n\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` takes a list of integers as input.\n* It initializes a variable `value` to 0.\n* It uses a for loop to iterate over the integers in the list from index 36 to index 85, inclusive.\n* Inside the loop, it checks if the current integer is divisible by 27 or 96 using the modulo operator (`%`).\n* If the integer is divisible, it adds its value to the `value` variable.\n* Finally, the function returns the `value` variable, which contains the sum of all integers divisible by either -27 or -96 from index 36 to index 85, or 0 if no such integers exist in the specified range."
