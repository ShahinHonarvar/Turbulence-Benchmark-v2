  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either 982 or 319 from index 306 to index 957, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(lst):\n  return sum([i for i in lst[306:958] if i % 982 == 0 or i % 319 == 0]) or 0\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Python code implements the following algorithm:\n\n1. Takes a list of integers as input.\n2. Slices the list from index 306 to 957 (inclusive) using `lst[306:958]`.\n3. Creates a new list using a list comprehension that filters out elements that are not divisible by 982 or 319 using the modulo operator (`%`).\n4. Calculates the sum of the filtered elements using the `sum()` function.\n5. Returns the sum. If the filtered list is empty (i.e., no elements meet the divisibility condition), the `or 0` expression ensures that the function returns 0."
