  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_three_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 62, 96 and 26.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def gcf_three_nums(nums):\n            a, b, c = nums[62], nums[96], nums[26]\n            return greatest_common_factor(a, b, c)\n        ```\n\nThe above code snippet is one way to implement the function in Python. Other implementations are possible as well. In some cases, finding the greatest common factor of three numbers via the Euclidean algorithm might be faster than finding the greatest common factor of two numbers and then finding the greatest common factor of that result with the third number. I\'m not sure if there is a best way to implement this function without being slow."
