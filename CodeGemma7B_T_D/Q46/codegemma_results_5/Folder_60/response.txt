  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_three_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 96, 53 and 35.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        from math import gcd\n        def gcf_three_nums(nums):\n            gcf = gcd(nums[96], gcd(nums[53], nums[35]))\n            return gcf\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `gcf_three_nums` function takes a list of integers as its input. It then uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to calculate the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 96, 53, and 35. Finally, the function returns the GCF."
