  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_three_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 92, 69 and 95.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n  a = nums[92]\n  b = nums[69]\n  c = nums[95]\n  t_gcd = math.gcd(a, b)\n  final_gcd = math.gcd(t_gcd, c)\n  return final_gcd\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `gcf_three_nums` function takes in a list of positive integers and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 92, 69, and 95. It accomplishes this by:\n\n- Extracting the elements at the given indices: `a = nums[92]`, `b = nums[69]`, and `c = nums[95]`.\n- Calculating the greatest common factor of `a` and `b` using the `math.gcd()` function: `t_gcd = math.gcd(a, b)`.\n- Calculating the greatest common factor of `t_gcd` and `c` using the same function: `final_gcd = math.gcd(t_gcd, c)`.\n- Return the `final_gcd`."
