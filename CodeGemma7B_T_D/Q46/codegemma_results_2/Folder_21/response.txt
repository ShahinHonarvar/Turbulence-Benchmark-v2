  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_three_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 412, 932 and 337.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n  num1 = nums[412]\n  num2 = nums[932]\n  num3 = nums[337]\n  common_factor = math.gcd(num1, math.gcd(num2, num3))\n  return common_factor\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function `gcf_three_nums` is defined with a single argument, which is a list of positive integers named `nums`.\n2. The code extracts the elements at indices 412, 932, and 337 from the list using list indexing.\n3. The `math.gcd()` function is used to find the greatest common factor of the three extracted elements.\n4. The greatest common factor is returned as the output of the function."
