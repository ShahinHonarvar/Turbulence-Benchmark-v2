The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_three_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 145, 183 and 770.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n    a = nums[145]\n    b = nums[183]\n    c = nums[770]\n\n    gcd = a\n\n    if b > gcd:\n        gcd = b\n\n    if c > gcd:\n        gcd = c\n\n    for i in range(2, gcd + 1):\n        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0 and c % i == 0:\n            gcd = i\n            break\n\n    return gcd\n```\n\nThe code can be tested by saving it to a file and then running the following command:\n\n```\npython gcf_three_nums.py\n```\n\nThe output of the command should be the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 145, 183 and 770 of the list passed as an argument to the `gcf_three_nums` function."
