  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_three_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 31, 25 and 80.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n  a = nums[31]\n  b = nums[25]\n  c = nums[80]\n  \n  while b > 0:\n    a, b = b, a % b\n  while c > 0:\n    a, c = c, a % c\n  return a```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The provided code defines a function named `gcf_three_nums` that takes a single argument called `nums`.\n\n2. This argument is expected to be a list of positive integers.\n\n3. The function extracts the elements at indices 31, 25, and 80 from the list and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\n4. It then implements a modified Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common factor of these three numbers.\n\n5. This algorithm involves repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and replacing the larger number with the remainder until the smaller number becomes zero.\n\n6. The final value of `a` represents the greatest common factor of the three numbers.\n\n**Note:** It\'s important to ensure that the list `nums` has elements at indices 31, 25, and 80 before calling this function, otherwise, it will result in an IndexError."
