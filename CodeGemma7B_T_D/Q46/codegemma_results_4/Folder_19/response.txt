  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_three_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 40, 15 and 99.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n  a, b, c = nums[40], nums[15], nums[99]\n  return gcd(a, gcd(b, c))\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n  while b:\n    a, b = b, a % b\n  return a\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `gcf_three_nums` function takes a list of integers as input.\n* It extracts the elements at indices 40, 15, and 99.\n* It uses a helper function `gcd` to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three elements.\n* The `gcd` function implements the Euclidean algorithm for GCD calculation.\n* The result of `gcd` is returned as the output of the `gcf_three_nums` function."
