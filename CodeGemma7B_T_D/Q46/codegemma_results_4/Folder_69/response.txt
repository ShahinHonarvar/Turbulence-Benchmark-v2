  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'gcf_three_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 404, 834 and 517.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef gcf_three_nums(nums):\n  from math import gcd\n  return gcd(nums[404], gcd(nums[834], nums[517]))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input.\n- It imports the `gcd` function from the `math` module, which calculates the greatest common factor of two numbers.\n- It returns the result of calling the `gcd` function three times, each time passing in the elements at indices 404, 834, and 517 from the `nums` list."
