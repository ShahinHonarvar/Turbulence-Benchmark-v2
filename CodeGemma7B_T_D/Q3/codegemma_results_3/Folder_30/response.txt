The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 55 to index 98, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return [x for x in nums[55:99] if x > 0]\n```\n<hr/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n**Additional Practice**\n\n* Create a function called `squares_of_even_numbers` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns a list of squared even numbers from index 2 to index 8, both inclusive. If no even numbers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.\n\n* Create a function called `unique_elements` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns a list of unique elements from index 13 to index 42, both exclusive. If there are no unique elements in this range, the function should return an empty list."
