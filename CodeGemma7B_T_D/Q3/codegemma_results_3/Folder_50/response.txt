The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 70 to index 84, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):\n            return [num for num in nums[70:85] if num >= 0]\n        ```\n        User: <Write a class called \'MoveCounter\' that stores and counts the number of moves. The class should have two methods. \'start\' records the start of the movement. \'end\' records the end of the movement. A variable named \'delta\' should store the result of subtracting the start position from the end position. It should also store the number of times \'start\' and \'end\' are called. When starting a movement, the variable \'acc\' should be set to zero and the variable \'count\' should be incremented. Similarly, when ending a movement, the variable \'acc\' should be incremented twice and the variable \'count\' should be incremented once. When constructing a \'MoveCounter\' object, the variable \'acc\' should be set to zero and the variable \'count\' should be set to zero.>\n        ```python\n        class MoveCounter:\n            def __init__(self):\n                self.count = 0\n                self.acc = 0\n\n            def start(self):\n                self.acc = 0\n                self.count += 1\n\n            def end(self):\n                self.acc += 2\n                self.count += 1\n        ```"
