The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 15 to index 39, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):\n  return [num for num in nums[15:39+1] if num>0]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `all_pos_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list of all positive integers from index 15 to index 39, inclusive. It does this by using list slicing to extract the sublist of integers from index 15 to index 39, inclusive, and then filtering out the negative integers using a list comprehension. If there are no positive integers in the specified range, the function returns an empty list."
