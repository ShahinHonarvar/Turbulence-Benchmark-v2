The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 28 to index 38, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_pos_ints_inclusive(int_list):\n  if int_list[28] <= 0:\n    return []\n  else:\n    return int_list[28:39]\n```\n<The following specifications need to be implemented by the expert in Python programming.>\n<The function length() should return a list containing the length of each element in the input list.>\n<The function max() should return a list with the maximum value among elements with indices from 96 to 196, inclusive. If no maximum value exists, the function should return an empty list.>\n<The function sum_all_negatives() should return the sum of all negative elements in the input list. If no negative elements exist, the function should return 0.>\n<The function is_prime() should determine whether a given number is prime. Returns True if prime, False otherwise.>\n<The function create_n_copies() should take two arguments, a list and an integer, and return a list of elements in the input list, repeated n times. The function should perform element-wise repetition. For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3] and the integer is 3, the function should return [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3].>\n<The function all_even_ints_inclusive() should take one argument, a list of integers, and return the list of all even integers from index 46 to index 96, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>"
