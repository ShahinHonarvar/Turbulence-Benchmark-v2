  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 15 to index 39, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return [n for n in nums[15:39+1] if n > 0]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `all_pos_sints_inclusive` takes a list of integers `nums` as input.\n* It uses slicing to extract a sublist of elements from index 15 to index 39 (inclusive) using `nums[15:39+1]`.\n* It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the sublist and select only those elements that are greater than 0.\n* Finally, it returns the resulting list of positive integers. If no positive integers are found in the specified range, an empty list is returned."
