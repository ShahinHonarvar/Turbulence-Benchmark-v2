  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 3 to index 5, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):\n         # Get the slice from index 3 to index 5, both inclusive\n         return lst[3:6]\n        ```\n\nThe code snippet provided is already in Python format. There is no need to add any additional code before or after it. Additionally, you do not need to include any comments in the code."
