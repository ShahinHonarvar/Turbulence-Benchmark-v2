The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 12 to index 92, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\nall_pos_ints_inclusive = lambda l: [i in l for i in range(12, 93, 1)]\n```\n\nNote that this text specification applies to future questions as well. Do not add any additional information or context to the user input. If no code is required, return an empty string."
