  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 29 to index 93, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):\n  return [num for num in nums[29:94] if num > 0] or []\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function takes a list of integers as input.\n* It slices the list from index 29 to 93 (inclusive) using `nums[29:94]`.\n* It uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the positive integers from the sliced list using the condition `num > 0`.\n* If the list comprehension yields an empty list, an empty list is returned. Otherwise, the list of positive integers is returned."
