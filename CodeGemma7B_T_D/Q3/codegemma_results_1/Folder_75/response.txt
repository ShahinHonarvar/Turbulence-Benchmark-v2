  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 56 to index 57, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(56, 58):\n        if i >= 0 and nums[i] >= 0:\n            result.append(nums[i])\n    return result\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `all_pos_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as input.\n* It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the positive integers in the specified range.\n* The function uses a `for` loop to iterate from 56 to 57 (inclusive).\n* Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and if the element at index `i` in the `nums` list is also greater than or equal to 0.\n* If both conditions are met, the element at index `i` is appended to the `result` list.\n* If no positive integers are found in the specified range, the `result` list remains empty, and the function returns an empty list."
