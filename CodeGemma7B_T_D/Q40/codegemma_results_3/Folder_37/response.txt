The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_n_smallest_chars\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 26 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in descending order and returns the list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code:\n```python\ndef return_n_smallest_chars(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Creates a list of 26 characters with the smallest ASCII values from a given string.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Create a list of tuples of characters and their ASCII values.\n  char_ascii_values = [(char, ord(char)) for char in n]\n\n  # Sort the list of tuples in ascending order of ASCII values.\n  char_ascii_values.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n  # Return the first 26 characters from the sorted list.\n  return [char for char, _ in char_ascii_values[:26]]\n```"
