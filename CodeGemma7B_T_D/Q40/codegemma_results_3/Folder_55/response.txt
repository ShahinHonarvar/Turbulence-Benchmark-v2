  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_n_smallest_chars\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 75 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in descending order and returns the list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Below is the requested Python code:\n```python\ndef return_n_smallest_chars(string):\n    string = sorted(string, key=ord)\n    return string[:75:-1]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `sorted()` function sorts the input string in ascending order based on the ASCII values of its characters using the `ord()` function as the key.\n\n2. Slicing the sorted string using `[:75]` extracts the first 75 characters.\n\n3. Slicing the extracted characters in reverse order using `[::-1]` sorts them in descending order.\n\n4. The resulting list of 75 characters with the smallest ASCII values is returned."
