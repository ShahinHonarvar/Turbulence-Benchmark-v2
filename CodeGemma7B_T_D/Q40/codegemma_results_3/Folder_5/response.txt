  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_n_smallest_chars\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 46 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in descending order and returns the list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def return_n_smallest_chars(str):\n            list_of_tuples = sorted(enumerate(str), key = lambda x: x[1])\n            return [i[1] for i in list_of_tuples[:46]][::-1]\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `return_n_smallest_chars` takes a string as input and returns a list of 46 characters with the smallest ASCII values.\n\nIt first converts the string to a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the index and the character. The key argument of the `sorted` function specifies that the tuples should be sorted by the second element (the character) in ascending order.\n\nThe list is then sliced to extract the first 46 elements, which represent the characters with the smallest ASCII values.\n\nFinally, the list is reversed using the `[::-1]` slice operator to get the characters in descending order."
