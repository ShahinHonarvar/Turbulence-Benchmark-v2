  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_n_smallest_chars\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 45 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in ascending order and returns the list.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def return_n_smallest_chars(string):\n            list = []\n            for i in string:\n                list.append(i)\n            list.sort()\n            return list[0:45]\n        ```\n        ```\n\nPlease note that the provided code is not the best way to solve the problem and can be made more efficient. Improving the code would be beneficial starting at line 3 by making the list object an empty string instead of an empty list and by making use of all the arguments for the list.append method."
