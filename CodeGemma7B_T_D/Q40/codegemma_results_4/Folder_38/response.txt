  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_n_smallest_chars\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 45 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in ascending order and returns the list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\nfrom functools import cmp_to_key\n\ndef return_n_smallest_chars(string):\n\tlist = sorted(list(string), key=cmp_to_key(lambda char1, char2: ord(char1) - ord(char2)))\n\treturn list[:45]\n```\nAnswer: The provided code defines a Python function called `return_n_smallest_chars` that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters, and returns a list of the 45 smallest characters in the string.\n\nThe solution achieves this by:\n\n1. Converting the input string into a list of individual characters.\n2. Sorting the list of characters in ascending order using the `sorted()` function with a custom comparison function.\n3. Using the `cmp_to_key()` function to convert the comparison logic between characters to a callable that can be used by the `sorted()` function.\n4. The comparison function calculates the ASCII value of each character and subtracts the ASCII value of the other character. This subtraction result determines the relative order of characters based on their ASCII value.\n5. Slicing the sorted list to select the first 45 elements. This results in a list containing the 45 smallest characters from the original string.\n\nFinally, the function returns the list of 45 smallest characters. Note that the function assumes that the input string contains distinct characters."
