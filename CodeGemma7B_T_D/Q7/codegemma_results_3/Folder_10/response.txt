  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_even_ints_inclusive(list):\n            a = [x for x in list[25:59+1] if x % 2 == 0]\n            return a\n        ```\nNote: This is just a sample answer and may not be the most efficient or accurate. To generate the best answer, it\'s important to understand the context of the question and the specific requirements of the user."
