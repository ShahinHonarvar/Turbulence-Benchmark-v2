  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 639 to index 975, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [x for x in lst[639:976] if x % 2 == 0] or []\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function `all_even_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of even integers from index 639 to index 975, inclusive.\n\n2. The list slicing operation `lst[639:976]` extracts a sublist containing the elements from index 639 to 975 (inclusive).\n\n3. The list comprehension operation `[x for x in lst[639:976] if x % 2 == 0]` iterates over the sublist and selects only those elements (integers) that satisfy the condition `x % 2 == 0`.\n\n4. If the list comprehension operation results in an empty list, it means there are no even integers in the specified range, so an empty list is returned. Otherwise, the list comprehension operation returns a non-empty list of even integers, which is then returned by the function."
