  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 50 to index 54, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nExpert: Hey guys, here\'s the code for `all_even_ints_inclusive` function:\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    results = []\n    for num in nums[50:55]:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            results.append(num)\n\n    return results\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of integers (`nums`) as an argument. It then creates an empty list called `results`. Using a `for` loop, the function iterates over the elements of the list starting from index 50 and ending with index 54 (inclusive) using slicing (`nums[50:55]`). For each element, if the element is even (`num % 2 == 0`), the element is appended to the `results` list. Finally, the `results` list is returned, containing all the even integers within the specified range. If no even integers are found, an empty list is returned."
