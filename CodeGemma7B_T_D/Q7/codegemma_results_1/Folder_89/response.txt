  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 56 to index 82, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: \n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n  if not any(n % 2 == 0 for n in lst[56:82]):\n    return []\n  return [n for n in lst[56:82] if n % 2 == 0]\n```\n---\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `all_even_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as input. It uses generator expressions to create a boolean mask that identifies even numbers within the specified range (56 to 82). The `any` function checks if at least one even number exists in the mask. If no even numbers are found, the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns a new list containing all even numbers within the specified range."
