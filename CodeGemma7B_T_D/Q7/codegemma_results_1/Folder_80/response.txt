  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 64 to index 66, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(int_list):\n        ans = []\n        for i in range(64, 67):\n            if int_list[i] % 2 == 0:\n                ans.append(int_list[i])\n        return ans\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `all_even_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers `int_list` as input.\nIt initializes an empty list `ans` to store the even integers in the specified range.\nThe `for` loop iterates from index 64 to 66 (inclusive).\nFor each index, it checks if the integer at that index is even (i.e., `int_list[i]` modulo 2 is 0).\nIf an even integer is found, it appends it to the `ans` list.\nFinally, the function returns the `ans` list, which contains all the even integers in the specified range or an empty list if no even integers were found."
