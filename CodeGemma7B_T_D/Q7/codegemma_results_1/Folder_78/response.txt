  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 43 to index 51, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return [i for i in lst[43:52] if i % 2 == 0]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `all_even_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as input.\n* It uses slicing to extract a sublist from index 43 to 51 (inclusive).\n* It uses a list comprehension to filter out odd numbers by checking if the remainder of dividing each element by 2 is 0.\n* The resulting list of even integers is returned.\n* If no even integers exist in the specified range, the list comprehension will return an empty list."
