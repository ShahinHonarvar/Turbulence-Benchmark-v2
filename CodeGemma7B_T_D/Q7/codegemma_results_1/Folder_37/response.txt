  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n  return [i for i in lst[1:6] if i % 2 == 0]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `all_even_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as input.\n* It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the list from index 1 to index 5 (inclusive).\n* Inside the list comprehension, it checks if each element is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division by 2 is 0, then the element is even.\n* The list comprehension returns a new list with all the even elements from the specified range.\n* If no even elements are found in the specified range, the list comprehension returns an empty list."
