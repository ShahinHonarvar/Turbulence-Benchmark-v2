  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 62 to index 63, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n            res = []\n            for i in range(62, 64):\n                if lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n                    res.append(lst[i])\n            return res or []\n        ```\n        return res or [] is a concise way to return an empty list if the list res is empty. Imagine this line without this \"or []\", we will return res, which is an array of even elements. But if no elements satisfy the condition, then res will be an empty array, and we will get an error when we perform return res. However, if we add \"or []\" to the end, then this return statement will return an empty list [] in this case."
