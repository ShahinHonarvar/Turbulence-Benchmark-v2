  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 34 to index 55, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n            even_nums = []\n            for i in range(34, 56):\n                if nums[i] % 2 == 0:\n                    even_nums.append(nums[i])\n            if not even_nums:\n                return []\n            return even_nums\n        ```\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `all_even_ints_inclusive()` function takes a list of integers `nums` as input. It initializes an empty list `even_nums` to store the even integers in the specified range. The function then iterates through the range from 34 to 55 (inclusive) using a `for` loop. For each index `i` in this range, the function checks if `nums[i]` is even (divisible by 2). If it is even, the function appends `nums[i]` to the `even_nums` list. \n\nAfter iterating through the entire range, the function checks if the `even_nums` list is empty. If it is empty, it means there are no even integers in the specified range, so the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, the function returns the `even_nums` list, which contains the even integers in the specified range."
