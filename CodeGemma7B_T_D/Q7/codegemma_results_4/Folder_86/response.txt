The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 31 to index 34, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n            return [num for num in nums[31:34+1] if num % 2 == 0]\n        ```\n        The list comprehension inside the function:\n\n        - List Comprehension takes the list nums from index 31 (inclusive) to index 34 (inclusive).\n        - It filters the elements in the list to include only even integers.\n        - It then returns the filtered list as the result."
