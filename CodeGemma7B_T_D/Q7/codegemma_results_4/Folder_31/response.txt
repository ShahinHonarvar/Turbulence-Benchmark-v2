  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 75 to index 88, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem (output): Triple backticks ```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n  return [i for i in lst[75:89] if i % 2 == 0] or []\n```\n\n## Explanation of the Python Code:\n\n* **`def all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):`**: This line defines the function with the given name and takes one argument, a list called `lst`.\n* **`return [i for i in lst[75:89] if i % 2 == 0] or []`**: This line contains the core logic of the function. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing even integers from index 75 to index 88 (inclusive) in the input list `lst`.\n    * **`i for i in lst[75:89]`**: This iterates over elements `i` of `lst` from index 75 to 88, inclusive.\n    * **`if i % 2 == 0`**: This checks if the integer `i` is even (divisible by 2 and has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2).\n    * **`[i]`**: If `i` meets the conditions above, it is appended to the new list. \n    * **`or []`**: If no even integers are found in the specified range, the list comprehension returns an empty list."
