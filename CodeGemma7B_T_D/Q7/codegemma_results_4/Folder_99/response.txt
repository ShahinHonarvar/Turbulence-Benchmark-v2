  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 310 to index 370, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[310:371] if num % 2 == 0]\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `all_even_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as input.\n* The list comprehension works on a slice of the list from index 310 to 370, inclusive.\n* Within the list comprehension, we check if each number is even using the modulo operator (`%`) and return a new list with the even numbers.\n* If no even numbers exist in the specified range, the empty list is returned."
