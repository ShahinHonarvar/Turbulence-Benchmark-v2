  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 33 to index 36, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n<Partition the start of the list into a new list. Then, partition it into a new list that contains only elements in the range [33, 36]. The list comprehension should be used to obtaining the final output list. Finally, use a conditional statement to check if the list is empty and return the appropriate output based on the result of the conditional statement. Use conditional expression to shorten the code.>\n        System:\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(number_list):\n    new_list = number_list[:33]\n    filtered_list = [num for num in new_list[33:37] if num % 2 == 0]\n    return filtered_list if filtered_list else []\n```"
