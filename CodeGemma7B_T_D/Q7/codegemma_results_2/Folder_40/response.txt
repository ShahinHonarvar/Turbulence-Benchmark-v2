  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 0 to index 2, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef all_even_ints_inclusive(int_list):\n    even_nums = []\n    for num in int_list:\n        if num % 2 == 0 and num >= 0 and num <= 2:\n            even_nums.append(num)\n    return even_nums\n```\n\nThe Python code above meets the requirements of the user\'s text specification. The code consists of a function called `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function iterates through the list and checks if each integer is even and falls within the specified range of 0 to 2 inclusive. If an integer satisfies these conditions, it is appended to a new list called `even_nums`. Finally, the function returns the `even_nums` list, which contains all the even integers from index 0 to index 2, inclusive."
