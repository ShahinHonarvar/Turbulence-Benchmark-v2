  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_contains_anagrams\' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at most 67 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the English letters. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef if_contains_anagrams(str_list):\n    anagrams = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for word in str_list:\n        word = \'\'.join(sorted(word.lower()))\n        if len(word) >= 3:\n            anagrams[word] += 1\n\n    pairs = 0\n    for count in anagrams.values():\n        pairs += (count * (count - 1)) // 2\n\n    return pairs <= 67\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function uses a dictionary to store the anagrams. The key of the dictionary is the sorted string, and the value is the number of times that anagram appears in the list.\n\nThe function iterates through the list of strings and processes each string.\n\nThe string is converted to lowercase and sorted using the `sorted()` function. The resulting sorted string is used as the key in the dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, the value is incremented. Otherwise, the key is added to the dictionary with a value of 1.\n\nAfter processing all the strings, the function iterates through the dictionary and calculates the number of pairs of anagrams.\n\nThe formula used to calculate the number of pairs is `(count * (count - 1)) // 2`, where `count` is the number of times an anagram appears in the list. This formula calculates the number of pairs of anagrams for each anagram and then sums up the results.\n\nFinally, the function checks if the number of pairs is less than or equal to 67. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`."
