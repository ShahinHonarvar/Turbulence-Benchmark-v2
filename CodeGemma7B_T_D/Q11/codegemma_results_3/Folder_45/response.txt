  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the largest element from index 30 to index 30, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: The following Python code is provided:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_num(number_list):\n    max_num = float(\'-inf\')\n    for num in number_list[30:31]:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n    return max_num\n```\n\n---\n\nThe code provided above contains a few issues:\n\n1. The for loop only iterates over a single element, num. If the list has more than one element at index 30, the loop will only return the largest element among those one.\n2. The condition in the for loop should be num > max_num instead of num > max_num which can result in unexpected behavior.\n\nThe following corrected code should work as expected:\n```python\ndef find_largest_num(number_list):\n    max_num = float(\'-inf\')\n    for num in number_list[30:31]:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n    for num in number_list[30:]:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n    return max_num\n```"
