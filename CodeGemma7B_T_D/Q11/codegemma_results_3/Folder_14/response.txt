  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the largest element from index 5 to index 7, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef find_largest_num(num_list):\n  max_num = float(\'-inf\')\n  for num in num_list[5:8]:\n    max_num = max(max_num, num)\n  return max_num\n```\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `find_largest_num` takes a list of numbers as an argument.\n* It initializes a variable `max_num` to negative infinity (`float(\'-inf\')`).\n* The function iterates through the elements of the list from index 5 to index 7, both inclusive.\n* For each element, it compares it to `max_num` and updates `max_num` if the element is larger.\n* The function returns `max_num`, which represents the largest element from index 5 to index 7, both inclusive."
