  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the largest element from index 6 to index 8, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_largest_num(lst):\n  max_num = lst[6]\n  for i in range(7, 9):\n    if lst[i] > max_num:\n      max_num = lst[i]\n  return max_num\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `find_largest_num` takes a list `lst` as its input argument. It initializes a variable `max_num` to the element at index 6 of the list. Then, it iterates through the indices 7 to 8 (inclusive) and updates `max_num` to the maximum value it encounters along the way. Finally, it returns the value of `max_num`."
