  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the largest element from index 56 to index 98, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def find_largest_num(nums):\n            largest = float(\'-inf\')\n            for num in nums[56:99]:\n                if num > largest:\n                    largest = num\n            return largest\n        ```\n\n\nThe original prompt contained a logical error. In this case, \'99\' is inclusive, but the list indices start from \'0\'. Therefore, to include \'99\', the stopping index should be \'98\' which is the 99th element of the list.\n\nTherefore, the correct code should be:\n```python\ndef find_largest_num(nums):\n    largest = float(\'-inf\')\n    for num in nums[56:99]:\n        if num > largest:\n            largest = num\n    return largest\n```"
