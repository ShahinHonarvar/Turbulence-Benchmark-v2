  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the largest element from index 686 to index 987, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_largest_num(nums):\n            max_num = float(\'-inf\')\n            for num in nums[686:988]:\n                if num > max_num:\n                    max_num = num\n            return max_num\n        ```\n\nThis is a good example of how the system and user work together to generate code. The user provides a text specification, and the system generates Python code based on that specification. The code is also concise and efficient, which is important for real-world programming."
