  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 81 to index 86, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_pos_ints_exclusive(nums):\n            return [i for i in nums if i > 0 and 81 < i < 86]\n        ```\n        System: The provided code is a simple one-liner, which uses a list comprehension to iterate through the list of integers. Positive integers are filtered out using the `if` condition `i > 0`. The second condition `81 < i < 86` ensures that we only consider integers from index 81 to index 86, exclusive. The result is a list of positive integers within the desired range. If no such integers are found, an empty list is returned."
