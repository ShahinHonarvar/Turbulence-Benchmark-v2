  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 7 to index 9, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_pos_ints_exclusive(nums):\n            ans = []\n            for i in range(7,9):\n                if i>=0 and i>=len(nums) or nums[i]<0:\n                    continue\n                ans.append(i)\n\n            return ans\n        ```\n\nThis should work. `all_pos_ints_exclusive([1,2,3,4])` should give `[7,8]`."
