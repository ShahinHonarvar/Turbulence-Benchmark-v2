The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 0 to index 4, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        Return a list of all positive integers from index 0 to index 4, both exclusive, within the input list. If no positive integers exist in the required range, return an empty list.\n\n        For instance:\n            if the input list = [1, 2, 4]\n            the output should be = [2, 4]\n        ```\n\nThis is the text specification you are given.
