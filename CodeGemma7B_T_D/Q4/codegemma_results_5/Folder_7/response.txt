  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 323 to index 972, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_pos_ints_exclusive(arr):\n    return [num for num in arr if num > 0 and 323 < arr.index(num) < 972]\n```\n\nThe code above works because we first iterate over the input list using a list comprehension. We then use the `if` condition to check if the current element is positive and if its index is greater than 323 and less than 972. If both conditions are met, we append the element to the result list. In case no element in the list satisfies the conditions, we return an empty list."
