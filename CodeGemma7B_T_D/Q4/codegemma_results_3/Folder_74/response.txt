The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 13 to index 70, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef all_pos_ints_exclusive(nums):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(13, 70):\n        if i >= 0:\n            result.append(nums[i])\n    return result\n```\n        System: The Python code generates an error because the results list is appended when the list index may be out of bounds. The corrected code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef all_pos_ints_exclusive(nums):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(13, 70):\n        if i >= 0 and i < len(nums):\n            result.append(nums[i])\n    return result\n```\n```"
