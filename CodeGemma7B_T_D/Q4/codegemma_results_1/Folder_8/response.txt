  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_pos_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 56 to index 92, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n```python\ndef all_pos_ints_exclusive(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[56:92] if num > 0]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code defines a function `all_pos_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as input. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the sublist of the input list from index 56 to 92, exclusive.\n\nThe `if` clause within the list comprehension checks if each number in the sublist is greater than 0. If it is, the number is included in the result list, which is then returned by the function. If no positive integers are found in the specified range, the function will return an empty list."
