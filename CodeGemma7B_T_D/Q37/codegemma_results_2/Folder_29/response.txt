The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 12 and 88, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \'&\' and smaller than or equal to character \'v\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code without comments:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(text):\n  filtered_text = \"\"\n  for i in range(len(text)):\n    if i >= 12 and i <= 88 and ord(text[i]) >= ord(\'&\') and ord(text[i]) <= ord(\'v\'):\n      continue\n    filtered_text += text[i]\n  return filtered_text\n```"
