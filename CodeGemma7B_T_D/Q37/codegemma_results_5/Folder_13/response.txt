  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 124 and 854, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \'9\' and smaller than or equal to character \'s\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def filter_chars(string):\n            filtered_string = \"\"\n            for char in string:\n                if (124 <= ord(char) <= 854 and char >= \'9\' and char <= \'s\'):\n                    continue\n                filtered_string += char\n            return filtered_string\n        ```\nThis code is the solution to the prompt. It provides a function called `filter_chars` that takes a string as an argument and removes any characters from between indices 124 and 854, inclusive, that are greater than or equal to \'9\' and smaller than or equal to \'s\'. It returns the filtered string with the characters removed and the other characters in the same order. The code is concise and efficient, making it easy to read and understand."
