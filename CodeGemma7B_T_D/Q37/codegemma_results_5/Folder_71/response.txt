  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 32 and 46, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \'0\' and smaller than or equal to character \'k\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    return \'\'.join([char for char in string if char not in range(32, 47) or ord(char) > ord(\'k\')])\n```\n\nThe text specification allows for flexibility in the implementation. The reference to \"between indices 32 and 46, both inclusive\" and \"greater than or equal to character \'0\' and smaller than or equal to character \'k\'\" implies that the function needs to handle all characters in that range, regardless of their encoding. While we could hard-code the character ranges, it is more robust to use the `ord()` function to convert characters to their corresponding Unicode code points.\n\nThe provided Python code addresses the functionality described in the user\'s specifications. The code utilizes a list comprehension that iterates over each character in the input string. For each character, the code checks if it falls outside the specified range or is a character greater than \'k\'. If the condition evaluates to True, the character is excluded from the output string. Otherwise, it is included. The resulting list is then joined into a string and returned."
