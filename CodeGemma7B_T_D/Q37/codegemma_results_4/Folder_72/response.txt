The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 35 and 51, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \'H\' and smaller than or equal to character \'s\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\n<Create a new function called \'main\', which accepts two arguments and returns the result of calling the \'filter_chars\' function on the first argument with the second argument as the argument.>\n        <Call the \'main\' function with the arguments \'abcdefghijklmNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\' and \'L\', and pass the result to the `filter_chars` function again.
