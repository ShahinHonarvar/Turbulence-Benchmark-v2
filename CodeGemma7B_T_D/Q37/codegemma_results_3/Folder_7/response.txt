  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 521 and 722, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \'>\' and smaller than or equal to character \'_\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n  filtered_s = \"\"\n  for i in range(len(s)):\n    if i >= 521 and i <= 722 and s[i] >= \'>\' and s[i] <= \'_\':\n      continue\n    else:\n      filtered_s += s[i]\n  return filtered_s\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `filter_chars` takes a string `s` as input.\n- It initializes an empty string `filtered_s` to store the filtered string.\n- It iterates over the characters in the string using a `for` loop.\n- If the current index `i` is within the range `[521, 722]` (inclusive) and the character at that index is greater than or equal to `\' > \'` (ASCII code 62) and less than or equal to `\'_ \'` (ASCII code 95), it skips that character and continues to the next iteration.\n- Otherwise, it appends the current character to the `filtered_s` string.\n- Finally, it returns the filtered string `filtered_s`."
