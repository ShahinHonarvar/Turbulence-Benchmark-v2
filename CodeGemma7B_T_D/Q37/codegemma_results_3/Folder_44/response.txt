  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 21 and 43, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \'+\' and smaller than or equal to character \'8\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def filter_chars(text):\n            filtered_text = \"\"\n            for char in text:\n                if not (21 <= text.index(char) <= 43 and \'+\' <= char <= \'8\'):\n                    filtered_text += char\n            return filtered_text\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function `filter_chars` takes a string `text` as input.\n\n2. It initializes an empty string `filtered_text`.\n\n3. It iterates over each character `char` in the input string `text`.\n\n4. For each character, it checks if its index in the string is between 21 and 43 (inclusive) and if it is between \'+\' and \'8\' (inclusive).\n\n5. If the character meets these criteria, it does not include it in `filtered_text`.\n\n6. If the character does not meet these criteria, it is appended to `filtered_text`.\n\n7. Finally, the function returns the `filtered_text` string."
