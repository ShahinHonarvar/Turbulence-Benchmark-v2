  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 83 and 99, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \'*\' and smaller than or equal to character \'j\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(x):\n    y=[b for i,b in enumerate(x) if i>=83 and i<=99 and ord(b)>=ord(\'*\') and ord(b)<=ord(\'j\')]\n    for a in y:\n        x=x.replace(a,\'\')\n    return x\n```\n\nThe `filter_chars` function satisfies the following conditions:\n\n* It takes one argument, a string.\n* For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 83 and 99, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \'*\' and smaller than or equal to character \'j\' (inclusive), the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string.\n* The function returns the altered string."
