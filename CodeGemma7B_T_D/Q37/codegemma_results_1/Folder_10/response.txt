The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 63 and 84, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character \'E\' and smaller than or equal to character \'~\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    if len(string) <= 84:\n        return string\n    filtered_string = string[:63] + \'\'.join([char for char in string[63:84] if char not in string[63:84] or char < \'E\' or char > \'~\']) + string[84:]\n    return filtered_string\n```\nPlease note the two code samples are identical, except for the spaces and line breaks."
