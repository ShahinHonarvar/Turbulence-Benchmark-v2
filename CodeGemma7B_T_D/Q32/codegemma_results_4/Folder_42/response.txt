  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'j\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'O\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n    return string.replace(\"O\", \"Oj\", 1)\n```\nThis problem can be solved in several ways, using the `replace` method, string concatenation, or list comprehension. The provided `replace` method code is a simple and efficient solution that directly replaces the first occurrence of `O` with `Oj`."
