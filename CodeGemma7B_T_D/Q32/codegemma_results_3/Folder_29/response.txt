  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'z\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'N\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def insert_after_character(str):\n          result = \"\"\n          for char in str:\n            if char == \'N\':\n              result += char + \'z\'\n            else:\n              result += char\n          return result\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function works by iterating through each character in the input string. If the character is \'N\', it is appended to the result string followed by \'z\'. Otherwise, the character is simply appended to the result string without any modifications. Finally, the result string is returned."
