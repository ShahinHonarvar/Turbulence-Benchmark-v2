  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'h\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'5\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Triple backticks\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(text):\n    return \"\".join([c + \"h\" if c == \"5\" else c for c in text])\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `insert_after_character` function takes a string as input and returns a new string with \'h\' inserted after \'5\' occurrences.\n\nThe function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is \'5\', it is appended to the new string with \'h\' appended directly after it. Otherwise, the original character is simply appended.\n\nFinally, the function joins the list of characters back into a string and returns it."
