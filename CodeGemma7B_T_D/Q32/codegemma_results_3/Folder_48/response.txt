  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'U\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'S\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef insert_after_character(str):\n    a = list(str)\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        if a[i] == \'S\' and a[i+1] != \'U\': a[i+1] = \'U\'\n    s = \'\'.join(a)\n    return s\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `insert_after_character()` function takes a string and returns a new string with the \'U\' inserted after every \'S\'.\n* The `list()` function converts the string to a list of characters.\n* The `range()` function creates a sequence of integers from 0 to the length of the list.\n* The `if` statement checks if the current character is \'S\' and the next character is not \'U\'. If this condition is true, the next character (\'U\') is inserted after the current character.\n* The `join()` function converts the list of characters back into a string.\n* The `return` statement returns the new string."
