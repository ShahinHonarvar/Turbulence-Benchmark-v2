  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'M\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'9\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        from itertools import groupby\n\n        def insert_after_character(text):\n            return \'\'.join(c if c != \'9\' else c + \'M\' for c in text)\n\n\n        ```\n\nPlease note that the provided code snippet is a clear and concise implementation of the problem statement. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the characters in the input string, and if the current character is \'9\', it inserts an \'M\' after it. Otherwise, it simply returns the character as is. The use of `groupby()` is not necessary in this specific case, as the input string is already in the desired order."
