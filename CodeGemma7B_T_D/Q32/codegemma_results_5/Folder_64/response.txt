  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'u\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'u\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef insert_after_character(string):\n  new_string = \"\"\n  for char in string:\n    if char == \"u\":\n      new_string += char + \"u\"\n    else:\n      new_string += char\n  return new_string\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe `insert_after_character` function iterates over the input string character by character. Whenever a \'u\' is encountered, the function inserts a second \'u\' immediately after it in the new string. Otherwise, if the character is not \'u\', it is simply appended to the new string without any modifications. Finally, the function returns the new string, which contains \'u\' characters inserted after every occurrence of \'u\' in the original string."
