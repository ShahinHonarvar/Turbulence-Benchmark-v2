  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'G\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'c\'.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def insert_after_character(text):\n            new_string = \"\"\n            for char in text:\n                if char == \"c\":\n                    new_string += char + \"G\"\n                else:\n                    new_string += char\n            return new_string\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `insert_after_character` takes a string and iterates through each character in the string. If the current character is `c`, the function inserts the character `G` after it. Otherwise, the function simply includes the current character in the output string. Finally, the function returns the new string with `G` inserted after every occurrence of `c`."
