  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'I\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'i\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\n        def insert_after_character(input_str):\n          new_str = \"\"\n          for char in input_str:\n            if char == \"i\":\n              new_str += char + \"I\"\n            else:\n              new_str += char\n          return new_str\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function iterates over each character in the input string and checks if it is equal to \"i\". If it is, the function appends two characters to the new string: the current character followed by \"I\". Otherwise, the function appends only the current character. Finally, the function returns the new string."
