  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'W\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'e\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def insert_after_character(text):\n            for index, char in enumerate(text):\n                if char == \'e\':\n                    list_text = list(text)\n                    list_text.insert(index + 1, \'W\')\n                    return \'\'.join(list_text)\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `insert_after_character` takes a single argument `text` of type string. It does not return any value explicitly but generates a new string.\n2. **Character Iteration**: The `enumerate` function allows us to iterate through the string while keeping track of the index of each character.\n3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, we check if the current character is \'e\'. If it is, we perform the insertion operation.\n4. **Character Insertion**: We convert the string to a list using `list(text)` and insert the character \'W\' at the position after the current index using `insert(index + 1, \'W\')`.\n5. **String Reconstruction**: We join the modified list back into a string and return it."
