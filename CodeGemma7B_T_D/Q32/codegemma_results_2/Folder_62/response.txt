  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'o\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \' \'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef insert_after_character(text):\n  \"\"\"Inserts \'o\' after each space in a string.\"\"\"\n  output = \'\'\n  for character in text:\n    if character == \' \':\n      output += character + \'o\'\n    else:\n      output += character\n  return output\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `insert_after_character` takes one argument, `text`, which represents the input string.\n- An empty string, `output`, is initialized to store the modified string.\n- A `for` loop iterates over each character in the `text` string.\n- If the current character is \' \', a space is appended to `output` along with the letter \'o\'.\n- Otherwise, the character is simply appended to `output` without any modifications.\n- Finally, the `output` string containing the inserted \'o\' characters is returned."
