  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'e\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'e\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef insert_after_character(text):\n  new_text = \"\"\n  for char in text:\n    new_text += char\n    if char == \"e\":\n      new_text += \"e\"\n  return new_text\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `insert_after_character` takes one argument, `text`, and returns a new string.\n* The function creates a new string called `new_text`.\n* It uses a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the input `text` string.\n* For each character, it appends the character to `new_text` and checks if the character is `\'e\'`.\n* If the character is `\'e\'`, it appends another `\'e\'` to `new_text`.\n* Finally, the function returns the new string `new_text` with all occurrences of `\'e\'` followed by another `\'e\'`."
