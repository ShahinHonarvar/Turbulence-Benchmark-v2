  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_after_character\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character \'a\' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character \'a\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def insert_after_character(word):\n            new_word = word\n            for letter in new_word:\n                if letter == \'a\':\n                    new_word = new_word[: new_word.index(letter) + 1] + \'a\' + new_word[new_word.index(letter) + 1:]\n            return new_word\n        ```\nThe text specification may contain other parameters as well. In such a case, the Python code should be conforms to the parameters given in the text specification, without including any unnecessary code beyond what is necessary to fulfill the task."
