The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 41. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x):\n            prime = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]\n        result = set()\n        for c in prime:\n            if c > x:\n                break\n            elif c >= 100:\n                for i in range(2, int(c ** 0.5) + 1):\n                    if c % i == 0:\n                        break\n                else:\n                    result |= set(str(c))\n\n        result = list(filter(lambda x: (int(x) > 1) and (all(digit != \'0\' for digit in x)), result))\n        result.sort(reverse=True)\n        return result\n        ```"
