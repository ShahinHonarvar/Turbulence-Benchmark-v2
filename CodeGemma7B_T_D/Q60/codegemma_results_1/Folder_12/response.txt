The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 70. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.>\nOutput:\nExpert:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef all_left_right_truncatable_prime(in_tuple):        \n    x = in_tuple[70]        \n    x_list = []        \n    for number in range(2,x+1):     \n        if isprime(number):          \n            str_num = str(number)          \n            if str_num.count(\'0\') == 0:             \n                for index in range(1,len(str_num)):       \n                    if isprime(int(str_num[:index])) and isprime(int(str_num[index:])):         \n                        x_list.append(number)     \n    x_list.sort(reverse=True)     \n    return x_list      \n\n#print(all_left_right_truncatable_prime((1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70)))\n```"
