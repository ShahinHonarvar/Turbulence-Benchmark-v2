  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 0. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code you requested:\n\n```python\ndef all_left_right_truncatable_prime(t):\n    x = t[0]\n    digs = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\n    results = []\n    for p in range(x, 1, -1):\n        if str(p)[-1] not in digs or str(p)[0] not in digs:\n            continue\n        if all(p % d for d in range(2, p)):\n            results.append(p)\n            left, right = str(p)[1:], str(p)[:-1]\n            while len(left) > 1 or len(right) > 1:\n                if not all(int(left) % d for d in range(2, int(left))):\n                    break\n                elif not all(int(right) % d for d in range(2, int(right))):\n                    break\n                left, right = left[1:], right[:-1]\n            else:\n                results.append(int(left))\n                results.append(int(right))\n    return sorted(results, reverse=True)\n```"
