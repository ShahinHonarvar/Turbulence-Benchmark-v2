The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 992. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\ndef all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x):\n    results = []\n    for num in range(2, x + 1):\n        if not (\'0\' in str(num)):\n            prime = isprime(num)\n            while prime and num > 10:\n                num = int(str(num)[1:])\n                prime = isprime(num)\n            if prime and num in range(2, 10**2):\n                results.append(num)\n    return sorted(results)\n```"
