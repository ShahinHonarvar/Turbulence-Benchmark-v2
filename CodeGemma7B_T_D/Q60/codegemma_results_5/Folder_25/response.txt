  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 92. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(tuple_x):\n            # ... your code here ...\n        ```\nGive me a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem thoroughly.**\n\n* Read the problem statement carefully and identify the requirements for the function.\n* Determine the data types and ranges for the input and output.\n* Analyze the definition of a left-and-right-truncatable prime number.\n\n**Step 2: Design a Solution Algorithm.**\n\n* Determine the search range for prime numbers based on the input x.\n* Implement a primality testing algorithm to efficiently identify prime numbers.\n* Implement functions to truncate leftmost and rightmost digits from prime numbers.\n* Check if a number is left-and-right-truncatable by applying the truncation and primality testing functions.\n* Return a sorted list of left-and-right-truncatable primes found within the search range.\n\n**Step 3: Implement the Code.**\n\n* Translate the designed algorithm into Python code, ensuring it adheres to the specified code structure.\n* Test the code with different input values to ensure it meets the requirements.\n\n**Step 4: Optimization (Optional)**\n\n* Explore and implement optimizations to improve the efficiency of the code.\n\n**Note:** The code provided in the prompt should be used as a starting point and not be copied directly. Instead, follow the step-by-step analysis to develop your own solution."
