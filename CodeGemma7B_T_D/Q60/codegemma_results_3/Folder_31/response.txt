The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 50. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.>\nOutput:\n```python\n# Your code goes here.\n```\n\nHere is the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_left_right_truncatable_prime(tp):\n  x = tp[50]\n  if x < 2 or x % 2 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:\n    return []\n  primes = [2, 3, 5] + [i for i in range(7, x, 2) if all(i % j for j in range(3, int(i**0.5) + 1, 2))]\n  ans = []\n  for i in primes:\n    if \'0\' not in str(i):\n      a, b = str(i)[0], str(i)[-1]\n      while a + b != \'1\' and a + b != \'2\' and a + b != \'5\' and a + b != \'8\':\n        i, a, b = int(b), b, a + b\n        if i in primes:\n          ans.append(i)\n  return sorted(ans, reverse=True)\n```"
