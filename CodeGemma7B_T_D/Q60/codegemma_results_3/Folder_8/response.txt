The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_left_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 41. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        # SOLUTION\n        from sympy import isprime, nextprime\n\n        def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(t):\n            x = t[41]\n            res = []\n            for y in range(2, x//2+1):\n                if isprime(y) and \'0\' not in str(y):\n                    xx = y\n                    while xx in range(2, x//2+1):\n                        xx = nextprime(xx)\n                        if isprime(xx) and int(str(y) + str(xx)) in range(2, x):\n                            t = xx\n                            while t < x and int(str(t) + str(xx)) in range(2, x):\n                                t = nextprime(t)\n                            if t >= x:\n                                res.append(int(str(y) + str(xx)))\n                        xx = nextprime(xx)\n\n            return res[::-1]\n        ```"
