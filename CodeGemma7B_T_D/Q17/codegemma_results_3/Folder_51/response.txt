The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -1 and -10 from index 6 to index 9, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(some_list):\n    a, b = some_list[6:10]\n    for num in (a, b):\n        if num % 2 == 0 and num % 10 == 0:\n            print(num)\n```\n        System: As per the text specification, the list of integers to be passed to the function should be list of [-1, 10, -10, 0, -2, 100, -100, -4, 15, 20]. Then, the output of the function should be [-100, 20] as the only two numbers divisible by both -1 and -10 in the given list are these two, and both lie within the specified range."
