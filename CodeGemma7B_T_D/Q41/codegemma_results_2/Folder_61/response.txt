  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'identical_elements\' that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 0 and index 6, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\n`\n        ```python\n        def identical_elements(list_x, list_y):\n            for i in range(7):\n                if list_x[i] == list_y[i]:\n                    print(list_x[i])\n        ```\n        `\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe provided code defines a function called `identical_elements` that takes two lists, `list_x` and `list_y`, as input. The function iterates over the elements of the lists from index 0 to 6, using a `for` loop and the `range()` function. If an element at the current index in both lists is the same, the element is printed using `print()`. If no elements are identical between the lists for the given indices, the function will not print any elements and will return an empty string."
