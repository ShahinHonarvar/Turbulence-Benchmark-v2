  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'identical_elements\' that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 17 and index 78, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def identical_elements(list1, list2):\n            result = set()\n            for i in range(17, 79):\n                if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n                    result.add(list1[i])\n            return result\n        ```\n\nThis text specification shows how to create a function that takes two lists of the same size as an input and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 17 and index 78, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.\n\nThe text specification also shows the following information:\n\n* The function should be named `identical_elements`.\n* The function should have two arguments, two lists of the same size.\n* The function should return a set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists between the indices 17 and 78, inclusive.\n\nThe code that was generated by the system is shown below:\n\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list1, list2):\n    result = set()\n    for i in range(17, 79):\n        if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n            result.add(list1[i])\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code is valid Python code and it will return the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists between the indices 17 and 78, inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function will return an empty set."
