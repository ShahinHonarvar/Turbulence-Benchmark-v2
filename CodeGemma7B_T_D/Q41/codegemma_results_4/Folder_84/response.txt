If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function returns an empty set. The code iterates over the lists from index 43 to index 86, and for each index, it checks if the elements at the current index in both lists are identical. If they are identical, the element is added to the set of identical elements. Finally, the function returns the set of identical elements."
