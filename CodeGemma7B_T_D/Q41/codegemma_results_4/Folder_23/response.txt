  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'identical_elements\' that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 52 and index 71, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef identical_elements(lst1, lst2):\n    indices = list(range(52, 72))\n    return set(lst1[i] for i in indices if lst2[i] in lst1[i] for i in indices)\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `identical_elements` takes two lists as input and returns a set.\n\nIt creates a list of indices between 52 and 71 inclusive.\n\nIt then uses a set comprehension to iterate over the indices and check if the element at the current index in `lst2` is present in `lst1` at the same index. If it is, the element is added to the set.\n\nIf no elements are found, the function returns an empty set."
