  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'identical_elements\' that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 43 and index 51, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef identical_elements(list_a, list_b):\n  return set(x for x in list_a[43:52] if x in list_b[43:52])\n```\nThe provided text specification is easy to understand, and the provided code is an example of what the code should look like. The code is also efficient and uses list slicing to effectively find the common elements between the two lists."
