  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'identical_elements\' that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 56 and index 57, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\nExpert:```python\nfrom itertools import compress\n\ndef identical_elements(lst1, lst2):\n    lst1 = lst1[56:58]\n    lst2 = lst2[56:58]\n    return set(compress(lst1, lst2))\n```\n\nThe function `identical_elements` takes two arguments: `lst1` and `lst2`, which are two lists of the same size. It then sublists both lists to only contain the elements between index 56 and index 57, inclusive. The function then uses the `compress` function from the `itertools` module to combine the two lists, keeping only those elements that appear in both lists at the same index. The function returns the resulting set of identical elements or an empty set if no identical elements are found between the two lists."
