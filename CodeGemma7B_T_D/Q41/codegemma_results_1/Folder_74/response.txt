Then, it subtracts the occurrences of each element in the first list from the occurrences of the same element in the second list.\n\n  Finally, the function returns a set of all elements with positive counts, as these are the elements that occur at least once in both lists in the range of indices 17 to 78, inclusive.\n\n  Args:\n    lst1: The first list.\n    lst2: The second list.\n\n  Returns:\n    A set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists in the range of indices 17 to 78, inclusive.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  if len(lst1) != len(lst2):\n    raise ValueError(\"The lists must be of the same size.\")\n\n  counts1 = Counter(lst1)\n  counts2 = Counter(lst2)\n\n  return {element for element, count in counts1.items() if counts2[element] > count and 17 <= element <= 78}\n```"
