def identical_elements(lst1, lst2):
    """
  This function takes two lists as input, of the same size, and returns a set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists in the range of indices 17 to 78, inclusive.

  The function first checks if the lists are of the same size. If not, it raises an error.

  Next, the function uses the `Counter` class to count the occurrences of each element in the first list. Then, it subtracts the occurrences of each element in the first list from the occurrences of the same element in the second list.

  Finally, the function returns a set of all elements with positive counts, as these are the elements that occur at least once in both lists in the range of indices 17 to 78, inclusive.

  Args:
    lst1: The first list.
    lst2: The second list.

  Returns:
    A set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists in the range of indices 17 to 78, inclusive.
