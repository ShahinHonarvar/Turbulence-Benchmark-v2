The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'identical_elements\' that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 35 and index 49, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.>\nOutput:\n<Return the answer in set form. It is crucial to use set methods whenever possible to solve this problem.>\n```python\ndef identical_elements(list_one, list_two):\n  set_one = {item for item in list_one[35:50]}\n  set_two = {item for item in list_two[35:50]}\n  return set_one & set_two\n```"
