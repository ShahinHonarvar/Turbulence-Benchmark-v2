  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindrome_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 49, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\n(Note: The set of palindromes returned by the function must be created without using lists or sets. Instead, it should use a frozenset to preserve the order of the elements in the set.\n\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(word):\n    word = word.lower()\n    set_palindrome = set()\n    for i in range(len(word) - 48):\n        substring = word[i:i + 49]\n        if substring == substring[::-1]:\n            set_palindrome.add(substring)\n    return frozenset(set_palindrome)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The `palindrome_of_length_n()` function takes one argument, `word`, which should be a string.\n- The function converts the input string to lowercase using `word.lower()`.\n- It initializes an empty set called `set_palindrome` to store the palindromes.\n- The function uses a loop to iterate over the characters in the string. The upper limit for the loop is set to `len(word) - 48` because we need to check substrings of length 49.\n- For each character, it extracts a substring of length 49 starting from that character\'s index.\n- The substring is checked for palindrome condition using `if substring == substring[::-1]:`.\n- If the substring is a palindrome, it adds the substring to the `set_palindrome` set.\n- After checking all substrings, the function returns the `frozenset` representation of the palindrome set.\n- A frozenset is an immutable set that preserves the order of the elements in the set, similar to a tuple."
