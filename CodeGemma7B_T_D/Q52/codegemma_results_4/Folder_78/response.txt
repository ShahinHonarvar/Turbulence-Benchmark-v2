The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindrome_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 48, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\nimport re\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(s):\n    Sym = set(l+u for l,u in product(\'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\', repeat=2))\n    ans = set()\n    for i in range(48):\n        p = s[i::]\n        for r in [p, p[::-1]]:\n            if r in Sym:\n                ans.add(r)\n    return ans\n```\n< ...
