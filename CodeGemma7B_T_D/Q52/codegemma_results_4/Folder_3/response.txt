  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindrome_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 100, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def palindrome_of_length_n(text):\n            def is_palindrome(word):\n                return word == word[::-1]\n            ...\n            ...\n            return result\n        ```\n\nThe shortcodes used in the text specification are as follows:\n\n* `...`: You may add additional lines of code to complete the function.\n* `[]`: You may define any additional functions or variables necessary to complete the function.\n\n**Note:** This prompt is not asking you to rewrite the prompt as Python code. The prompt asks you to take the existing Python code and fill in the missing pieces to complete the function.\n```python\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(text):\n    def is_palindrome(word):\n        return word == word[::-1]\n\n    result = set()\n    size = 100\n\n    for i in range(len(text)):\n        for j in range(i + size, len(text) + 1):\n            word = text[i:j]\n            if is_palindrome(word.lower()):\n                result.add(word)\n\n    return result\n```"
