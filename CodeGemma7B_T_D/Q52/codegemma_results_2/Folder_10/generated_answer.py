    Write a function called 'palindrome_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a string,
    and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 54, where each palindrome
    is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.
    If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string,
    the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a
    case-insensitive manner.
