The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindrome_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 474, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set.
