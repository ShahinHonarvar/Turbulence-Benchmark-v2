The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindrome_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 20, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code according to the text specification:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef palindrome_of_length_n(string):\n    regex = re.compile(\'[^A-Za-z]\')\n    normalized_string = regex.sub(\'\', string)\n    lowercased_string = normalized_string.lower()\n\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(len(lowercased_string) - 19):\n        substring = lowercased_string[i:i + 20]\n        if substring == substring[::-1]:\n            palindromes.add(substring)\n\n    return palindromes\n```"
