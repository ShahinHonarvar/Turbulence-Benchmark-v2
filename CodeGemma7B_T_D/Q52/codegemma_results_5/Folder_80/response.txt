  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindrome_of_length_n\' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 276, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def palindrome_of_length_n(text):\n            text = text.lower()\n            return {text[i:i+276] for i in range(len(text) - 276 + 1) if text[i:i+276].isalpha()}\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code first converts the input text to lowercase using the `text = text.lower()` line.\n\nIt then uses a list comprehension to generate all possible substrings of length 276 starting from each position in the text. The substrings are filtered to include only those that consist of only letters using the `text[i:i+276].isalpha()` condition.\n\nThe result is returned as a set, to remove duplicates. If no palindromes of the specified length exist, an empty set is returned."
