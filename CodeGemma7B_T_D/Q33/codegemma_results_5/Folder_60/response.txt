  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_vowels\' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 24 (inclusive) and index 59 (exclusive) that are greater than character N and smaller than or equal to character U. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the Python code based on the given text specification:\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n  vowels_to_check = string[24:59]\n  vowels = [char for char in vowels_to_check if char in \'aeiouAEIOU\' and ord(char) > ord(\'N\') and ord(char) <= ord(\'U\')]\n  return vowels\n```"
