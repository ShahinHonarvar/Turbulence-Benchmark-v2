The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_vowels\' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 1 (inclusive) and index 7 (exclusive) that are greater than character F and smaller than or equal to character j. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the corresponding Python code:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(s):\n  new_list = [x for x in s if x.lower() in \'aeiou\' and 1 <= s.index(x) <= 7 and x.lower() > \'f\' and x.lower() <= \'j\']\n  return new_list if new_list else []\n```"
