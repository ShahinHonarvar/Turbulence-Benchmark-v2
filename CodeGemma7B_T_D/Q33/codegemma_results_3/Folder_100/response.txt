The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_vowels\' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 23 (inclusive) and index 75 (exclusive) that are greater than character L and smaller than or equal to character d. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = []\n    for i in range(23, 75):\n        ch = string[i]\n        if ch in \'aeiouAEIOU\' and ord(ch) > ord(\'L\') and ord(ch) <= ord(\'d\'):\n            vowels.append(ch)\n    return vowels\n```"
