  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_vowels\' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 82 (inclusive) and index 90 (exclusive) that are greater than character T and smaller than or equal to character b. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Sure, here\'s the Python code for the given problem:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(str):\n    vowels = [\'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\', \'u\']\n    filtered_vowels = [vowel for vowel in vowels if ord(vowel) > ord(\'T\') and ord(vowel) <= ord(\'b\') and str.index(vowel) >= 82 and str.index(vowel) < 90]\n    return filtered_vowels\n```"
