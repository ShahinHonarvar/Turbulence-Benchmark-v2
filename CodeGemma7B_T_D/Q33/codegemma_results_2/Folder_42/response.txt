  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_vowels\' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 12 (inclusive) and index 39 (exclusive) that are greater than character ; and smaller than or equal to character |. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef return_vowels(string):\n    vowels = [letter for letter in string if letter in \"aeiouAEIOU\" and 12 <= string.index(letter) < 39 and string[string.index(letter)] > \";\" and string[string.index(letter)] <= \"|\"]\n    if vowels:\n        return vowels\n    return []\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The function `return_vowels` takes a string as an argument.\n- It initializes a list `vowels` to store the vowels that meet the specified criteria.\n- It iterates over each letter in the string using a list comprehension.\n- If the letter is a vowel (in the letter string) and falls within the specified index range and character constraints, it appends to the `vowels` list.\n- After iterating through the entire string, it checks if the `vowels` list is empty. If it contains elements, it returns the list; otherwise, it returns an empty list."
