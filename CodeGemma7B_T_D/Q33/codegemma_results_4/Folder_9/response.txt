  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_vowels\' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 13 (inclusive) and index 35 (exclusive) that are greater than character 8 and smaller than or equal to character F. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef return_vowels(word):\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    result = []\n    for i, letter in enumerate(word):\n        if (i >= 13 and i < 35 and letter.lower() in vowels and ord(letter) > 8 and ord(letter) <= ord(\"F\")):\n            result.append(letter)\n    return result\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `return_vowels` function takes a single argument, `word`, which is a string.\n* This list contains all the vowel English letters: `vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]`.\n* An empty list `result` is created to store the vowels meeting the specified conditions.\n* The function iterates over the `word` string using a `for` loop.\n* For each letter in `word`, the index of the letter is also stored in `i`.\n* The letter is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method.\n* The letter\'s position in the `vowels` list is checked.\n* The Unicode code point of the letter is checked to be greater than 8 and less than or equal to the Unicode code point of \'F\'.\n* If all of these conditions are met, the letter is appended to the `result` list.\n* Finally, the function returns the `result` list."
