  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_vowels\' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 56 (inclusive) and index 90 (exclusive) that are greater than character K and smaller than or equal to character z. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(str_in):\n  vowels = [\'a\',\'e\',\'i\',\'o\',\'u\']\n  return_vowels = []\n  for i in range(56,90):\n    if (str_in[i] in vowels) and (ord(str_in[i])>ord(\'K\')) and (ord(str_in[i])<=ord(\'z\')):\n      return_vowels.append(str_in[i])\n  if return_vowels == []:\n    return_vowels = []\n  return return_vowels\n```\n\n## Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Function Definition:** The function `return_vowels` is defined with a single argument `str_in`.\n2. **List of Vowels:** A list of vowels is defined for future comparisons.\n3. **Empty List:** An empty list is created to store the vowels found in the specified range.\n4. **Iteration:** The `for` loop iterates through each character in the string from index 56 (inclusive) to 90 (exclusive).\n5. **Conditions:** For each character, three conditions are checked:\n    - Whether the character is a vowel using `if str_in[i] in vowels`.\n    - Whether the character is greater than character `K` using `ord(str_in[i])>ord(\'K\')`.\n    - Whether the character is smaller than or equal to character `z` using `ord(str_in[i])<=ord(\'z\')`.\n6. **Append Vowels:** If all three conditions are met, the character is appended to the `return_vowels` list.\n7. **Return Logic:**\n    - If the `return_vowels` list is empty after the loop, it means no vowels meet the conditions. So, an empty list is returned.\n    - Otherwise, the `return_vowels` list contains the vowels meeting the conditions, and it is returned from the function."
