  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_vowels\' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 50 (inclusive) and index 77 (exclusive) that are greater than character # and smaller than or equal to character r.

From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 50 (inclusive) and index 77 (exclusive) that are greater than character # and smaller than or equal to character r. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\n\nThe system then returned the following Python code:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(s):\n    vowels = [\'a\',\'e\',\'i\',\'o\',\'u\']\n    vocalized = [letter for letter in s.lower() if letter in vowels and s.index(letter)>=50 and s.index(letter)<77 and letter>=\"#\" and letter<=\"r\"]\n    return vocalized if vocalized else []\n```\n\nLet\'s break down the code:\n\n```python\ndef return_vowels(s):\n```\n\n- This line defines the function named `return_vowels` that takes one argument, `s`.\n\n```python\n    vowels = [\'a\',\'e\',\'i\',\'o\',\'u\']\n```\n\n- This line defines a list called `vowels` containing the vowels in lowercase.\n\n```python\n    vocalized = [letter for letter in s.lower() if letter in vowels and s.index(letter)>=50 and s.index(letter)<77 and letter>=\"#\" and letter<=\"r\"]\n```\n\n- This line uses a list comprehension to create a new list called `vocalized`. This list comprehension goes through each letter in the string `s` converted to lowercase and checks if the following conditions are met:\n    - The letter is in the `vowels` list.\n    - The letter\'s index in the string is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 77.\n    - The letter is greater than the character `#` (ASCII code 35) and less than or equal to the character `r` (ASCII code 114).\n\n```python\n    return vocalized if vocalized else []\n```\n\n- This line return the `vocalized` list if it\'s not empty, otherwise it returns an empty list.\n\n- Overall, this code defines a function `return_vowels` that takes a string as input and returns a list of vowels in the specified range and with the specified criteria."
