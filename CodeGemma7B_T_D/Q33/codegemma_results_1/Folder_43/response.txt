The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_vowels\' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 22 (inclusive) and index 82 (exclusive) that are greater than character N and smaller than or equal to character o. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code for the function \'return_vowels\':\n```python\ndef return_vowels(word):\n    vowels = []\n    for letter in word[22:82]:\n        if letter in [\'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\', \'u\'] and letter > \'N\' and letter <= \'o\':\n            vowels.append(letter)\n    return vowels\n```"
