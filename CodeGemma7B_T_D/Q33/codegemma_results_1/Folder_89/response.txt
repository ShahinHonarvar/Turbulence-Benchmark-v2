  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_vowels\' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 50 (inclusive) and index 51 (exclusive) that are greater than character , and smaller than or equal to character v. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def return_vowels(o):\n            vowels = (\'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\', \'u\', \'y\')\n            temp = [x for x in o if x in vowels and x > \',\' and x <= \'v\']\n            return temp if len(temp) > 0 else []\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `return_vowels` function takes one argument, `o`, which represents the input string. The function initializes a tuple of vowel letters, `vowels`. It then creates a list comprehension that iterates through the characters in `o`. For each character, it checks if it is in `vowels`, greater than `,` (index 50 in the ASCII character table), and less than or equal to `v` (index 86 in the ASCII character table). If these conditions are met, the character is appended to a temporary list `temp`. Finally, the function checks if the `temp` list is empty. If it is, an empty list is returned. Otherwise, the `temp` list is returned."
