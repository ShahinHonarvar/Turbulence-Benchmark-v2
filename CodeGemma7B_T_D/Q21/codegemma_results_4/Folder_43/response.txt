  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -64 from index 10 to index 37, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(int_list):\n    return [num for num in int_list[10:38] if num % 64 == 0]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `all_ints_div_by_num()` takes a list of integers as input. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements from index 10 to 37 (inclusive). For each element, it checks if it is divisible by -64 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the element is divisible by -64, it is added to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list, which will either contain the integers divisible by -64 from index 10 to 37, or an empty list if no such integers exist."
