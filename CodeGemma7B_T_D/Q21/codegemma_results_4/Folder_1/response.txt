  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -95 from index 59 to index 77, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(lst):\n    lst = lst[59:78]\n    return [i for i in lst if i % -95 == 0] or []\n```\nThe code snippet you provided is perfectly valid Python code that meets the requirements of the user\'s prompt:\n\n- It defines a function named `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a single argument, a list of integers.\n- It slices the list of integers from index 59 to 77, inclusive, and stores the result in a new list called `lst`.\n- It uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the integers in `lst` that are divisible by -95.\n- It checks if the result of the list comprehension is an empty list. If it is not, it returns the result. Otherwise, it returns an empty list.\n\nThis code snippet is efficient and concise, and it satisfies the requirements of the user\'s prompt."
