  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by 14 from index 43 to index 76, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: \'\'\'\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n   return [num for num in nums[43:77] if num % 14 == 0]\n        \'\'\'\n```\nThis code contains the following elements:\n\n* A function definition with the name `all_ints_div_by_num`, which takes a list of integers as its argument.\n* A list comprehension inside the function, which iterates through the slice of the list from index 43 to index 76 (inclusive).\n* A conditional expression within the list comprehension, which checks if the current integer is divisible by 14 using the modulo operator (`%`).\n* The conditional expression returns a list of integers that satisfy the condition (i.e., those divisible by 14).\n\nThe code also includes a return statement that returns the list of integers divisible by 14 or an empty list if no such integers exist."
