  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by 7 from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: For this problem, you can use list slicing to efficiently extract the relevant sublist within the bounds specified by the indices. Remember to check for cases where the sublist might be empty. Here is the corresponding Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(int_list):\n  if len(int_list) < 1:\n    return []\n  filtered_list = [num for num in int_list[0:1] if num % 7 == 0]\n  return filtered_list\n```"
