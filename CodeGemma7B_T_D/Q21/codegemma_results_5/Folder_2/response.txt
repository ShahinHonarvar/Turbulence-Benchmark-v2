  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by 58 from index 62 to index 70, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\n        def all_ints_div_by_num(num_list):\n            result = []\n            for num in num_list[62:71]:\n                if num % 58 == 0:\n                    result.append(num)\n            return result\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as input. It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the integers divisible by 58.\n\nInside the loop, it iterates over the elements of the input list from index 62 to index 70 (inclusive). For each element, it checks if it is divisible by 58 using the modulo operator (`%`).\n\nIf an element is divisible by 58, it appends it to the `result` list. If no elements are found in the specified range, the `result` list remains empty.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` list, which either contains the integers divisible by 58 from index 62 to 70 or an empty list."
