  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by 39 from index 45 to index 80, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(num_list):\n  result = []\n  for num in num_list[45:81]:\n    if num % 39 == 0:\n      result.append(num)\n  return result\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `all_ints_div_by_num` takes a list of integers as input.\n* It creates an empty list `result` to store the integers divisible by 39.\n* The loop iterates over the elements of the input list from index 45 to 80 (inclusive).\n* For each element, it checks if it is divisible by 39 using the modulo operator (`%`).\n* If the element is divisible by 39, it is appended to the `result` list.\n* Finally, the `result` list is returned. If no elements in the specified range are divisible by 39, an empty list is returned."
