  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -59 from index 42 to index 89, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[42:89+1] if num % 59 == 0]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function takes a list of integers `nums` as input.\n* It uses list comprehension to iterate over the sublist of `nums` from index 42 to index 89 (inclusive).\n* Inside the list comprehension, it checks if each integer `num` is divisible by 59 using the modulo operator (`%`).\n* If a number is divisible by 59, it is included in the result list.\n* If no numbers in the specified range are divisible by 59, the result list will be empty."
