  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 476 and 948 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character \'b\' and smaller than character \'d\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nOutput:\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if i not in range(476, 948):\n            if s[i] > \'b\' and s[i] < \'d\':\n                continue\n        result.append(s[i])\n    return \'\'.join(result)\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function iterates through each character in the string at an index outside the range (476, 948) and checks if the character is greater than \'b\' and smaller than \'d\'. If it is, it skips the character. Otherwise, it appends the character to a new list. Finally, the function returns the string formed by joining the elements in the result list."
