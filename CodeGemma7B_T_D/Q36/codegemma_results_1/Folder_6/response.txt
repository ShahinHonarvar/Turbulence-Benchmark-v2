  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 31 and 70 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character \'B\' and smaller than character \'v\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(string):\n    new_string = \"\"\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        if i < 31 or i >= 70 or string[i] <= \'B\' or string[i] >= \'v\':\n            new_string += string[i]\n    return new_string\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis code defines a function `filter_chars` that takes one argument, `string`.\n\nInside the function, a new empty string `new_string` is initialized.\n\nThe code then loops through each character in the input string using a for loop with the range function.\n\nWithin the loop, the indices of the string are checked. If the index is less than 31 or greater than or equal to 70, or the character at that index is less than or equal to \'B\' (ASCII code 66) or greater than or equal to \'v\' (ASCII code 118), the character is not added to `new_string`.\n\nOtherwise, the current character is appended to `new_string` to maintain the original order of characters.\n\nFinally, the function returns `new_string` with filtered characters removed."
