  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 42 and 68 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character \'t\' and smaller than character \'x\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\ndef filter_chars(a):\n    for i in range(42, 68):\n        c = a[i]\n        if c > \'t\' and c < \'x\':\n            a = a.replace(c, \'\')\n    return a\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `filter_chars` takes a string as its argument.\nIt iterates through each character in the string between indices 42 and 68 (exclusive) using the `range(42, 68)` function.\nFor each character, it checks if it is greater than \'t\' and smaller than \'x\'.\nIf the character meets this condition, it replaces all occurrences of that character in the string with an empty string using the `replace(c, \'\')` method.\n\nFinally, the function returns the altered string."
