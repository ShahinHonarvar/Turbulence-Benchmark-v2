The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 58 and 81 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character \'5\' and smaller than character \'>\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n```python\ndef filter_chars(input_str):\n    legal = [\'<,=\', \'[\', \'\\]\', \'^\', \'_\', \'{\', \'|\', \'}\', \'~\', \'0\', \'1\', \'2\', \'3\', \'4\', \'5\', \'>\', \';\', \':\', \'\\\"\', \'\\\'\', \'.\', \'(\', \')\']\n    output = \'\'\n    for char in input_str:\n        if (char in legal and char >= \'6\') and (char <= \'9\'):\n            output += char\n    return output\n```"
