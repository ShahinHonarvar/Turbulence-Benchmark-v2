  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 27 and 75 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character \'A\' and smaller than character \'i\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def filter_chars(s):\n            return \'\'.join([x for x in s if ord(x) not in range(ord(\'A\') + 27, ord(\'i\'))])\n        ```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `filter_chars` takes one argument, `s`, which is a string.\n* It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string.\n* Inside the list comprehension, it checks if the character\'s Unicode code point falls outside the specified range (27 to 75).\n* If the condition is true, the character is kept in the result string; otherwise, it is removed.\n* The result string is joined back into a single string and returned."
