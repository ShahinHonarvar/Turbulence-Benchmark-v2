  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 331 and 713 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character \'M\' and smaller than character \'_\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Certain steps are needed for this problem:\n        1. Convert the string to a list to enable character-based modifications.\n        2. Iterate through the list from index 331 to 713.\n        3. For each character in the range, if it meets the specified condition, replace it with an empty string.\n        4. Return the altered string as a list, then join it into a string using the join() method.\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filters characters in a string based on their position and value.\n\n    Args:\n    text: The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n    A string with filtered characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    text_list = list(text)\n    for i in range(331, 713):\n        if text_list[i] > \'M\' and text_list[i] < \'_\':\n            text_list[i] = \"\"\n    return \"\".join(text_list)\n```"
