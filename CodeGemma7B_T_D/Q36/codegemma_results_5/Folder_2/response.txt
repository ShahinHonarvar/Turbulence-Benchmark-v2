For each character between the indices 421 and 854 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character \'D\' and smaller than character \'J\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact.

The function uses a for loop to iterate through the characters in the string. For each character, it checks if it\'s within the desired range (421 to 854, exclusive) and within the desired alphabetical range (\"E\" to \"H\", inclusive). If the character meets these conditions, it skips adding it to the new string. Otherwise, it adds the character to the new string. Finally, the function returns the new string with the filtered characters."
