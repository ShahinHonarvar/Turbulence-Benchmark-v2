  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 13 and 40 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character \':\' and smaller than character \'C\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here\'s the Python code:\n```python\ndef filter_chars(word):\n  for i in range(13, 40):\n    if 58 < ord(word[i]) < 67:\n      word = word.replace(word[i], \'\')\n  return word\n```\n\nThis code snippet provides an example of how to create a function called `filter_chars` that takes one argument, a string, and returns the altered string. In the code, we use a loop to iterate over each character between the indices 13 and 40 in the given string. If the current character is greater than the character \':\' and smaller than the character \'C\', we replace all occurrences of that character within the string with an empty string. This effectively removes all occurrences of the character while preserving the order of the remaining characters."
