  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'filter_chars\' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 21 and 25 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character \'5\' and smaller than character \'}\', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def filter_chars(str):\n          for i in range(21, 25):\n            if ord(str[i]) > ord(\'5\') and ord(str[i]) < ord(\'}\'):\n              str = str.replace(str[i], \"\")\n          return str\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- We iterate through the string from index 21 to 25 (exclusive) using a `for` loop.\n- For each character, we use the `ord()` function to convert it to its Unicode code point.\n- We check if the character is greater than \'5\' and smaller than \'}\'.\n- If the condition is met, we replace the character with an empty string using the `replace()` method.\n- This process removes all occurrences of the character while preserving the order of the remaining characters.\n- Finally, we return the altered string."
