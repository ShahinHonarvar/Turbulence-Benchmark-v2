  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_at_index\' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [699, 556] has been inserted at index 361 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.>\nOutput:\nOutput: ```python\ndef insert_at_index(list):\n    first = list[:361]\n    second = list[361:]\n    return first + [699, 556] + second\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `insert_at_index` function uses Python slicing to extract the prefix of the list up to index 361 (exclusive) and the suffix of the list starting at index 361. These two sublists are then combined with the new element `[699, 556]` to create a new list with the element inserted at the correct index.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThe Python code is delimited only by triple backticks, as specified in the request. It does not contain any comments."
