  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_at_index\' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 38 has been inserted at index 52 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\n        def insert_at_index(lst):\n            return lst[:52] + [38] + lst[52:]\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `insert_at_index` takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with the element 38 inserted at index 52. The function uses slicing to extract the prefix of the list up to index 52, adds the element 38 to the extracted prefix, and then appends the suffix of the list to the new list. The result is a new list with one more element than the original list."
