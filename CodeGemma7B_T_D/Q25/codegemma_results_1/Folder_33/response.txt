  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_at_index\' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 974.0 has been inserted at index 556 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef insert_at_index(list):\n    list.insert(556, 974.0)\n    return list\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `insert()` method of Python lists inserts an element at a specified index. In this case, we insert `974.0` at index 556. The updated list is then returned by the function."
