  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'insert_at_index\' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [27, 34] has been inserted at index 38 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code according to the text specification:\n\n```python\ndef insert_at_index(arr):\n  return arr[:38] + [27, 34] + arr[38:]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `insert_at_index` function takes a list as input and returns a new list with the elements from the original list up to index 38, followed by the elements [27, 34], and then the remaining elements from the original list. This operation results in a list with one more element than the original list, as the newly inserted elements contribute two additional elements."
