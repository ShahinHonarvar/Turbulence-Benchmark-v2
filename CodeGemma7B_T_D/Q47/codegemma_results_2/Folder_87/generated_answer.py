    This function takes one argument, a string.

    Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 11 to index 93, both inclusive, should be considered. 
    Only palindromes of lengths between 34 to 54 (both inclusive) should be considered. 
    Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. 
    If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set. 
    The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
