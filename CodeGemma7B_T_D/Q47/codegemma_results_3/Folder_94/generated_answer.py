    """
    Finds all the palindromes of lengths between 45 to 51 (both inclusive) in the substring from index 40 to index 94, both inclusive. The function takes one argument, a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes with the following requirements. Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 40 to index 94, both inclusive, should be considered. Only palindromes of lengths between 45 to 51 (both inclusive) should be considered. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
