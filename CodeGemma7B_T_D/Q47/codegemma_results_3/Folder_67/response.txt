Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 65 to index 99, both inclusive, should be considered. Only palindromes of lengths between 26 to 33 (both inclusive) should be considered. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set.
