  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_of_specific_lengths\' that takes one argument, a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes with the following requirements. Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 62 to index 88, both inclusive, should be considered. Only palindromes of lengths between 18 to 21 (both inclusive) should be considered. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code that meets the requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement as comb_wr\n\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(text):\n    text = text.lower()\n    text = text[62:89]\n    return {\n        \'\'.join(candidate) for candidate in comb_wr(text, range(18, 22))\n        if \'\'.join(candidate) == \'\'.join(candidate)[::-1]\n    }\n```\n\nThis code uses the `itertools.combinations_with_replacement()` function to generate all possible substrings of the text with lengths between 18 and 21. It then checks if the substring is a palindrome by reversing the string and comparing it to the original substring. The result is a set of all palindromes that meet the requirements."
