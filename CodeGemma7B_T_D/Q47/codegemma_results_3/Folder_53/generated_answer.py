def palindromes_of_specific_lengths(text):
    """This function takes a string as input and returns the set of all palindromes with the following requirements.

  Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 1 to index 299, both inclusive, should be considered.
  Only palindromes of lengths between 3 to 10 (both inclusive) should be considered.
  Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.
  If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set.
  The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.

  Args:
    text: The string to search for palindromes in.

  Returns:
    The set of all palindromes of the specified lengths and within the specified index range, or an empty set if no such palindrome exists.
