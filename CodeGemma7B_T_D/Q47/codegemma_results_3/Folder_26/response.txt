  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_of_specific_lengths\' that takes one argument, a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes with the following requirements. Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 24 to index 84, both inclusive, should be considered. Only palindromes of lengths between 21 to 31 (both inclusive) should be considered. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    import re\n    pattern = re.compile(r\'[a-zA-Z]{21,31}\')\n    palindromes = set()\n    for i in range(24, 85):\n        for j in range(i + 20, i + 32):\n            word = s[i:j+1]\n            if pattern.fullmatch(word):\n                palindromes.add(word)\n    return palindromes\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function imports the `re` module for regular expression matching.\n2. It defines a regular expression pattern `r\'[a-zA-Z]{21,31}\'` to match palindromes of lengths between 21 and 31, composed of only English letters.\n3. It initializes an empty set `palindromes` to store the retrieved palindromes.\n4. It iterates over the substring from index 24 to 84, checking each substring length from 21 to 31.\n5. For each substring, it checks if it matches the regular expression pattern using `fullmatch()`.\n6. If the substring matches the pattern, it adds it to the `palindromes` set.\n7. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes or an empty set if no palindromes meet the specified criteria are found."
