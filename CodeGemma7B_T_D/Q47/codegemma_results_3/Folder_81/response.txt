  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'palindromes_of_specific_lengths\' that takes one argument, a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes with the following requirements. Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 12 to index 122, both inclusive, should be considered. Only palindromes of lengths between 12 to 220 (both inclusive) should be considered. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):\n    palindromes = {string[i:i+j][::-1] for i in range(12, 123) for j in range(12, 221) if j >= i and string[i:i+j].isalpha()}\n    return palindromes\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code utilizes a set comprehension to generate all possible palindromes within the specified index range and length constraints. The string slicing operation `string[i:i+j]` extracts substrings of length `j` starting at index `i`. The `::-1` operator reverses the substring, so `string[i:i+j][::-1]` returns the palindrome version of the substring.\n\nThe `for` loops iterate over all possible `i` and `j` values within the specified ranges. The `if` statement ensures that only palindromes of the correct length are considered. The `and` operation ensures that only substrings consisting of English letters are included.\n\nThe results are stored in a set, which automatically removes duplicates. If no palindromes meet the criteria, the set will be empty."
