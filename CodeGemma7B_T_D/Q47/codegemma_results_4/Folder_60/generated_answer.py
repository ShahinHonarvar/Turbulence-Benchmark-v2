    Only palindromes of lengths between 32 to 34 (both inclusive) should be considered.
    Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.
    If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set.
    The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
