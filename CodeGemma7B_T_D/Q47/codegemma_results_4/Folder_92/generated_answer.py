def palindromes_of_specific_lengths(text):
    """
    Finds all palindromes of lengths between 3 and 4 (inclusive) in a substring from index 0 to 4 (inclusive) of a given string, considering only palindromes consisting of English letters.

    Args:
    text (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    set: A set containing all palindromes that meet the specified requirements. An empty set is returned if no such palindrome exists in the specified index range.
