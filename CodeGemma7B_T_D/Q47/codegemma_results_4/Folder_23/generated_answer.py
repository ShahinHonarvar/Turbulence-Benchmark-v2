def palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):
    """
    Takes one argument, a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function
    should return the set of all palindromes with the following requirements.
    Only palindromes occurring in the substring from index 23 to index 94, both inclusive, should
    be considered. Only palindromes of lengths between 17 to 55 (both inclusive) should be considered.
    Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindrome with the length
    specified occurs in the specified index range, the function should return an empty set. The
    function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.

    Returns:
        A set of all palindromes of the specified lengths and indices.
