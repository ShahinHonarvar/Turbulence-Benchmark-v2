  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_second_largest_num(numbers):\n  if not (25 <= len(numbers) <= 59):\n    return \'None\'\n  numbers.sort()\n  return numbers[-2]\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function `find_second_largest_num` takes one argument, `numbers`, which is a list of numbers.\n2. It checks the length of the list. If the list is shorter than 25 or greater than 59, it returns `\'None\'`.\n3. It sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method.\n4. It returns the second-to-last element of the sorted list, which is the second largest number from index 25 to index 59 (inclusive).\n5. If the list is empty or does not have enough elements, it will return `\'None\'`."
