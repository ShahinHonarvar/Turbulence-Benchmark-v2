  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 639 to index 975, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_second_largest_num(num_list):\n            num_list.sort(reverse=True)\n            for i in range(639, 976):\n                if i < len(num_list):\n                    return num_list[i]\n            return \'None\'\n\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code works by sorting the input list of numbers in descending order. It then iterates through the list from index 639 to 975, inclusive. If the index is within the bounds of the list, it returns the element at that index. If the index is not within the bounds of the list, it returns \'None\'."
