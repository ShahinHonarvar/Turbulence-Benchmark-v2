  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 30 to index 48, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_second_largest_num(numbers):\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers[30:49])\n    if len(sorted_numbers) >= 2:\n        return sorted_numbers[-2]\n    return \'None\'\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `find_second_largest_num()` function takes a list of numbers as input.\n* It sorts the input list from index 30 to index 48, inclusive, in ascending order.\n* If the sorted list has at least two elements, it returns the second-to-last element, which represents the second largest element in the specified range.\n* If the sorted list has less than two elements, it returns the string \'None\' because there is no second largest element."
