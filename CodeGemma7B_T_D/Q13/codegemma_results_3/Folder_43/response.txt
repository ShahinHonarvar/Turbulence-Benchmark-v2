The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 68 to index 86, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nOutput:\n```python\ndef find_second_largest_num(numbers):\n    if len(numbers[68:87]) < 2:\n        return None\n    return sorted(numbers[68:87])[-2]\n```\n\nPlease note that the `None` should be returned if the length of the list from index 68 to 86, both inclusive, is less than 2, which means there\'s no second largest number."
