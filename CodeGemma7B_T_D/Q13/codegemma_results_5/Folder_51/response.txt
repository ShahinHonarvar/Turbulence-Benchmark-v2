  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 1 to index 8, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_second_largest_num(nums):\n            nums.sort(reverse=True)\n            if len(nums) <= 8 or not nums[1:9]:\n                return None\n            return nums[8]\n        ```\n\n3. The system should accept input from the user. The input should be in the format:\n\n```\n<Input format>\n```\n\n4. The system should pass the input to the `find_second_largest_num` function and store the output in a variable.\n\n5. The system should print the output to the console.\n\n```\n<Output>\n```\n\n(Note: The output should be on a new line.)"
