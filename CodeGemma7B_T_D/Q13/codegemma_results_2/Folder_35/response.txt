  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_second_largest_num\' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 30 to index 48, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return \'None\'.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_second_largest_num(nums):\n    nums = sorted(nums[30:49], reverse=True)\n    return nums[1] if len(nums) >= 2 else \'None\'\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function takes a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. It slices the input list from index 30 to index 48 (inclusive) and sorts it in descending order using `sorted(..., reverse=True)`.\n\n3. It checks if the sorted list has at least two elements. If not, it returns `\'None\'`. Otherwise, it returns the second element from the sorted list, which is the second largest number in the original input list."
