  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_nth_smallest_ascii\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 18th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 0 to 17, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def return_nth_smallest_ascii(str):\n          for index, char in enumerate(str):\n            if index >= 0 and index <= 17:\n              if index == 17:\n                return char\n              smallest = str[index]\n              current = str[index + 1]\n              while current != str[index] or current == smallest:\n                current = str[index + 0 + len(current)]\n              smallest = current\n```\nDo not include any comments in the code.
