  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_nth_smallest_ascii\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 11th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 20 to 80, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def return_nth_smallest_ascii(text):\n            def nth_smallest_ascii(text, index):\n                keys = text[index:index+20]\n                sorted_keys = sorted(keys)\n                return sorted_keys[index]\n            return nth_smallest_ascii(text, 9)\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code defines a function `nth_smallest_ascii` that takes two arguments: the input text and an index. It extracts a substring of 20 characters starting at the given index. Then, it sorts the substring and returns the character at the given index within the sorted substring.\n\nThe main function `return_nth_smallest_ascii` calls `nth_smallest_ascii` with an index of 9, which corresponds to the 11th smallest ASCII value (ASCII value of \'b\')."
