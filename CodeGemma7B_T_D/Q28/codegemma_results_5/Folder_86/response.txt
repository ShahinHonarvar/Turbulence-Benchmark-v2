  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_nth_smallest_ascii\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 44 to 69, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code:\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(line):\n    def get_ascii_value(c):\n        return ord(c)\n    return sorted([get_ascii_value(x) for x in line[44:70]], key=get_ascii_value)[14]\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `get_ascii_value` function converts a character to its ASCII value using the `ord` function.\n* The list comprehension creates a list of ASCII values from the characters in the substring of the input string between indices 44 and 69, inclusive.\n* The `sorted` function sorts the list of ASCII values in ascending order using the `get_ascii_value` function as the key.\n* The index `14` corresponds to the 15th smallest ASCII value in the sorted list.\n* The `return` statement returns the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value."
