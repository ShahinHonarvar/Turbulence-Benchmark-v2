  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_nth_smallest_ascii\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 13th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 33 to 85, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def return_nth_smallest_ascii(word):\n            new_word = sorted([c for c in word[33: 86]], key=ord)\n            return new_word[12]\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `return_nth_smallest_ascii` takes a string `word` as input.\n- It creates a new list `new_word` containing only the characters in the string from index 33 (inclusive) to 85 (inclusive) using list slicing.\n- It sorts `new_word` based on the ASCII values of the characters using the `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function and the `ord()` function.\n- It returns the 13th character in `new_word`, which has the 13th smallest ASCII value among the characters in the original string."
