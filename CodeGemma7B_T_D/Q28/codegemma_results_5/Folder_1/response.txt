  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_nth_smallest_ascii\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 11th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 21 to 59, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):\n          return min(c for c in string[21:60] if ord(c) > ord(\'a\'))\n        ```\n\nHere is the explanation of the provided Python code:\n\n* The `return_nth_smallest_ascii` function is defined.\n* The function takes a single argument, a string of distinct characters.\n* Inside the function, the `min` function is used to find the minimum ASCII value among the characters in the string that fall between indices 21 and 59, both inclusive.\n* The `min` function is called with a generator expression that iterates over the characters in the string using the slicing operation `string[21:60]` and filters out characters with ASCII values less than or equal to `ord(\'a\')`.\n* The `ord()` function converts the ASCII value of a character to an integer.\n* The result of the `min` function is returned as the output of the function."
