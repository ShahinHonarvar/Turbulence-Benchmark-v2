  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_nth_smallest_ascii\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 28 to 67, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Given the following text specification, here is the Python code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s: str) -> str:\n    start_index = 28\n    end_index = 67\n    nth_smallest = 15\n    \n    s_unique = list(set(s))\n    s_unique.sort()\n    \n    for i, c in enumerate(s_unique):\n        if start_index <= i <= end_index:\n            if nth_smallest == 1:\n                return c\n            nth_smallest -= 1\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `return_nth_smallest_ascii` function takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function returns the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 28 to 67, both inclusive.\n\n\n2. The function first extracts the unique characters from the string and sorts them in ascending order of ASCII values.\n\n\n3. The function then iterates through the sorted list of unique characters. For each character, it checks if its index is within the specified range of 28 to 67. If it is, the function increments a counter that tracks the number of characters encountered so far.\n\n\n4. If the counter reaches the desired nth_smallest number (15 in this case), the function returns the character. Otherwise, the function continues iterating until it reaches the desired nth_smallest number."
