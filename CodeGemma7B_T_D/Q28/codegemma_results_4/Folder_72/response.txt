  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_nth_smallest_ascii\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 18th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 33 to 60, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n            return sorted([c for c in s[32:61] if c.isascii()])[17]\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe provided text specification includes the following conditions:\n\n- The function should be called `return_nth_smallest_ascii`.\n- It should take one argument, a string of distinct characters.\n- It should return the character with the 18th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 33 to 60, both inclusive.\n\nThe Python code provided within the triple backticks meets these conditions:\n\n- It defines a function named `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes a single string argument.\n- It uses a list comprehension to extract the characters from the string between indices 32 and 61 (inclusive).\n- It filters out characters that are not ASCII.\n- It sorts the remaining characters based on their ASCII values.\n- It returns the 18th character in the sorted list, which represents the character with the 18th smallest ASCII value.\n\nThe code is concise, efficient, and meets the requirements of the rewritten problem."
