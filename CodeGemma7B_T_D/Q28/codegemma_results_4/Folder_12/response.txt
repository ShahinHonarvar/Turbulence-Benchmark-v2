The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_nth_smallest_ascii\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 5th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 3 to 26, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def return_nth_smallest_ascii(str):\n            mask = set(str)\n            ch_list = [ch for ch in mask if str.index(ch) in range(3, 27)]\n            ch_list.sort(key=lambda ch: ord(ch))\n            return ch_list[4]\n        ```\nClick here to see the answer for this question: https://longurl.org/74wGÃ‰hE"
