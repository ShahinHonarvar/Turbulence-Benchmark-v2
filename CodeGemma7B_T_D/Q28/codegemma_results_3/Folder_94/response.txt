  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'return_nth_smallest_ascii\' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 19th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 6 to 58, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(str):\n  return sorted([c for c in str[6:59]], key=ord)[-18]\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `return_nth_smallest_ascii` takes a string as input.\n* The list comprehension `[c for c in str[6:59]]` extracts characters from the string between indices 6 to 58 (inclusive).\n* The `key=ord` argument in `sorted()` specifies that the sorting key should be the ASCII value of each character.\n* The function returns the character with the 19th smallest ASCII value by indexing the sorted list at index -18."
