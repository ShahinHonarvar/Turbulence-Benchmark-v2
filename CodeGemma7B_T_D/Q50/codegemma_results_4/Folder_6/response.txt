The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_contains_anagrams\' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 26 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def if_contains_anagrams(str_list):\n            # Write your code here\n            pass\n        ```\n\nThis is the text specification given to me:\n\n```\n<Write a function called \'if_contains_anagrams\' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 26 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.>\n```\n\nThe Python code I generated:\n\n```python\ndef if_contains_anagrams(str_list):\n  str_list = [str_.lower() for str_ in str_list]\n  anagram_pairs = {}\n\n  for str_ in str_list:\n    sorted_str = \'\'.join(sorted(str_))\n    if len(str_) >= 3 and sorted_str not in anagram_pairs:\n      anagram_pairs[sorted_str] = True\n\n  return len(anagram_pairs) >= 26\n```\n\nThis code first converts all the strings in the list to lowercase and then sorts the characters of each string. The sorted string is then used as a key in a dictionary called `anagram_pairs`. If the sorted string is not already a key in the dictionary, it is added as a key with a value of `True`.\n\nThe code then checks if the number of keys in the dictionary is greater than or equal to 26. If it is, then there are at least 26 pairs of anagrams in the list; otherwise, there are not."
