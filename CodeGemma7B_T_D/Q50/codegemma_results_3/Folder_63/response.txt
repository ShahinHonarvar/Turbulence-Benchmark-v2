  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_contains_anagrams\' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 89 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        from itertools import combinations\n\n        def if_contains_anagrams(str_list):\n            str_list = [s.lower() for s in str_list]\n            str_list = sorted(str_list, key=len)\n\n            pairs = combinations(str_list, 2)\n            anagrams = [(p1, p2) for p1, p2 in pairs if sorted(p1) == sorted(p2) and len(p1) >= 3 and len(p2) >= 3]\n\n            return len(anagrams) >= 89\n        ```\n        System: The provided code defines a function named `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a list of strings as an argument. The function first converts all the strings in the list to lowercase and sorts them in ascending order based on their length. It then uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible pairs of strings from the sorted list. The function then iterates over these pairs and checks if each pair is an anagram of each other. Two strings are considered anagrams if they are of the same length and have the same characters in the same order. The function only considers anagrams of length at least three. The function returns `True` if there are at least 89 pairs of anagrams in the given list, and `False` otherwise."
