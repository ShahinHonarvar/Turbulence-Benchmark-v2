  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_contains_anagrams\' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 16 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        from collections import defaultdict\n\n        def if_contains_anagrams(str_list):\n            anagram_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\n            for string in str_list:\n                sorted_str = \'\'.join(sorted(string.lower()))\n                anagram_dict[sorted_str].append(string)\n\n            count_pairs = 0\n            for anagram_group in anagram_dict.values():\n                if len(anagram_group) >= 3:\n                    count_pairs += len(anagram_group) * (len(anagram_group) - 1) // 2\n\n            return count_pairs >= 16\n        ```\n        \nThe `if_contains_anagrams` function takes a list of strings as input and returns `True` if there are at least 16 anagram pairs present in the list. It utilizes the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module to create a dictionary where the keys are sorted anagrams of the strings in the list and the values are lists of strings that share the same anagram.\n\nThe function then iterates over the anagram groups in the dictionary and increments the `count_pairs` variable by the number of pairs in each group that have at least three strings. This is done using the formula `len(group) * (len(group) - 1) // 2` which calculates the number of ways to choose a pair of strings from a group of `n` strings.\n\nFinally, the function returns `True` if the `count_pairs` variable is greater than or equal to 16, indicating the presence of enough anagram pairs to satisfy the condition. Otherwise, it returns `False`."
