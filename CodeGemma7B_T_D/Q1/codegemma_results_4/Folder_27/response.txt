  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 37 to index 51, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return lst[37:52]\n```\nAs you can see, the `lst[37:52]` slice doesn\'t include the element at index 51; it only includes the elements at indices 37, 38, 39, ..., and 50. To include the element at index 51, we need to add 1 to the upper bound of the slice. Therefore, the correct code is `lst[37:52] + [lst[51]]`."
