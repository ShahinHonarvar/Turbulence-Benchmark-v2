  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 661 to index 924, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_ints_inclusive(lst):\n            return lst[661:924+1]\n        ```\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `all_ints_inclusive` takes one argument, a list of integers. It returns the list of elements from index 661 to index 924 (inclusive). The slicing notation `lst[661:924+1]` includes the element at index 924, so we add 1 to ensure that all elements between index 661 and index 924 are included in the output list."
