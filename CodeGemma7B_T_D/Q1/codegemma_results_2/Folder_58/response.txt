  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 246 to index 750, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nAnswer: \'\'\'def all_ints_inclusive(lst):\n  return lst[246:751]\'\'\'\nThe code looks simple, but it\'s not just the code that matters. It\'s also about understanding the context. What does the function `all_ints_inclusive` do? A typical use case for such a function might be to extract a specific range of elements from a long list without having to worry about indexing. This can be helpful for tasks like filtering a list or performing various sortings.  \n\nIs the proposed code snippet an example of a good Python code convention and best practices?"
