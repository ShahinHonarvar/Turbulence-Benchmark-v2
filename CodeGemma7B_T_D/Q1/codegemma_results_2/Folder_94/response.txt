  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 20 to index 30, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_ints_inclusive(nums):\n        return nums[20:31]\n        ```\n\nThe user may specify the following text specifications to extend the functionality of the Python code:\n\n•\tindex 20, option 1:\n\t\t- Replace \"20\" with a variable.\n\n•\tindex 30, option 1:\n\t\t- Replace \"30\" with a variable.\n\n•\tindex 20, option 2:\n\t\t- Replace \"20\" with a variable and an additional function or operator.\n\n•\tindex 30, option 2:\n\t\t- Replace \"30\" with a variable and an additional function or operator.\n\n•\tlist of elements, option 1:\n\t\t- Replace \"nums\" with a variable.\n\n•\tlist of elements, option 2:\n\t\t- Replace \"nums\" with a variable and an additional function or operator.\n\nPlease note that these options are applicable to both the initial prompt and any subsequent extensions.\n\nThis challenge is designed to test your knowledge of Python syntax and your ability to generate code based on user input."
