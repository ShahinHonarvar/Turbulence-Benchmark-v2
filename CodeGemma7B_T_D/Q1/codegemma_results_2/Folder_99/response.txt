  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 209 to index 556, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return lst[209:557]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The `def` keyword is used to define a function named `all_ints_inclusive`.\n- The function takes a single argument, `lst`, which is a list of integers.\n- The function returns a slice of the list from index 209 to 556, inclusive, using list slicing."
