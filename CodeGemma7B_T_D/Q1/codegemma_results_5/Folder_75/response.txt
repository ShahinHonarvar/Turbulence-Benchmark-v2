  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 56 to index 98, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_ints_inclusive(nums):\n            return nums[56:98+1]\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `all_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as input. It then uses slicing to extract elements from index 56 to 98, inclusive. The end index is specified as 98+1 to include the element at index 98. The function returns the sliced list."
