  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 22 to index 88, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(numbers):\n  return numbers[22:89]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `numbers` argument should be a list of integers.\n- The function should return the elements in the list between index 22 and index 88, inclusive.\n- The slicing operation `numbers[22:89]` includes both the elements at indices 22 and 88, as it uses a non-exclusive upper bound (89)."
