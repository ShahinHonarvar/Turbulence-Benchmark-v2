  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 10 to index 100, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_ints_inclusive(nums):\n            return nums[10:101]\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `def` keyword defines a function called `all_ints_inclusive`.\n* The function takes a single argument, `nums`, which is a list of integers.\n* The `return` keyword returns the sliced list `nums[10:101]`.\n* The slicing operation `[10:101]` includes elements from index 10 (inclusive) to index 100 (inclusive) in the new list.\n* This function returns a list containing all elements from index 10 to index 100, both inclusive."
