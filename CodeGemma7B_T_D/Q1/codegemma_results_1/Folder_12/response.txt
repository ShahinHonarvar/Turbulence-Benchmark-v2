The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 69 to index 83, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return lst[69:84]\n```\nThe code above does not follow the simple logic in the example. It does not work correctly when the list doesn\'t have at least 113 elements. It\'s also not readable and concise. Here is the improved code.\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of all elements from index 69 to index 83, both inclusive.\"\"\"\n    if len(lst) < 84:\n        raise IndexError(\"List does not have at least 84 elements.\")\n    return lst[69:84]\n```"
