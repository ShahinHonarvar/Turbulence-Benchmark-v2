  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 200 to index 200, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code for the problem:\n```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return nums[200:202]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code addresses the user\'s request by returning a sublist of the input list containing all elements from index 200 to index 201, inclusive. This ensures that both the starting and ending indices are included in the sublist."
