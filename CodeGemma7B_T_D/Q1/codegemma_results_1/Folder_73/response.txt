  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 52 to index 71, both inclusive.>\nOutput:\nExpert: ```python\ndef all_ints_inclusive(lst):\n    return lst[52:72]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `all_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as its argument.\n* It returns the slice of the list from index 52 to index 71, inclusive. This is done using the slicing operator (`[:]`), which includes both the start and end index.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, ..., 100]\nresult = all_ints_inclusive(my_list)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n[53, 54, 55, ..., 71]\n```"
