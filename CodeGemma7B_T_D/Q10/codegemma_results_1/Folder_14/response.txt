  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 1 to index 7, both exclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n    def list(all_odd_ints_exclusive):\n        list = []\n        for i in range(1,8):\n            if i % 2 != 0:\n                list.append(i)\n        return list\n```\n\nIn the provided text, the argument for the function is named `all_odd_ints_exclusive` but the provided code refers to the function as it is defined as `list`. Furthermore, the code in the provided text mixes up the return statement, returning a `list` and not an empty `list` as required. Instead, an empty `list` should be returned when no odd integers are found within the specified range."
