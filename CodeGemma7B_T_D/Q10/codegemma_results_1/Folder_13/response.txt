  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 73 to index 84, both exclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code you asked for:\n```python\ndef all_odd_ints_exclusive(L):\n    return [num for num in L[73:84] if num % 2]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `all_odd_ints_exclusive` function takes a list of integers `L` as input.\nInside the function, we use a list comprehension to iterate through the elements of `L` from index 73 to 84, exclusive.\nThe if-condition checks if the current element is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is not zero, the element is odd.\nIf an element is odd, it is appended to a new list called `result`.\nFinally, the function returns the `result` list containing all odd integers from index 73 to 84, exclusive. If no odd integers are found, an empty list is returned."
