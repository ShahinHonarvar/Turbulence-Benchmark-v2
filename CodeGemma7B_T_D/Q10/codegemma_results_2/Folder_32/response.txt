  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 11 to index 76, both exclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_odd_ints_exclusive(num_list):\n            odd_nums = [num for num in num_list[10:76] if num % 2 != 0]\n            return odd_nums if odd_nums else []\n        ```\nDoes the provided Python code conform to the requirements of the text specification?\n\nYes, the provided Python code conforms to the requirements of the text specification. The code defines a function called `all_odd_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of odd integers from index 11 to index 76, exclusive. If no odd integers exist in that range, the function returns an empty list. The code uses list comprehension to achieve this and is free of any comments."
