  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 44 to index 78, both exclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nOutput:\n        ```python\n        def all_odd_ints_exclusive(nums):\n          odd_nums = []\n          for i in range(44, 78):\n            if nums[i] % 2 != 0:\n              odd_nums.append(nums[i])\n          return odd_nums or []\n        ```\n\nThis is a great example of how to use list comprehensions. Let\'s think step by step.\n\n1. **Create an Empty List:** Create an empty list called `odd_nums` to store the odd integers.\n\n2. **Iterate with a for Loop:** Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list from index 44 to index 78 (exclusive).\n\n3. **Check for Odd Numbers:** For each element in the list, check if it is an odd number by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division by 2 is not equal to 0, it is an odd number.\n\n4. **Append Odd Numbers:** If the current element is an odd number, append it to the `odd_nums` list.\n\n5. **Return the Result:** After iterating through the entire list, return the `odd_nums` list. If the list is empty, it means there are no odd numbers in the specified range, so return an empty list instead."
