  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_odd_ints_exclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 41 to index 69, both exclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n```python\n        def all_odd_ints_exclusive(num_list):\n            # find the first odd number from index 41 to index 69\n            for i in range(41, 69):\n                if num_list[i] % 2 == 1:\n                    first_odd = num_list[i]\n                    break\n            else:\n                return []  # no odd numbers found in the specified range\n\n            # find the last odd number from index 41 to index 69\n            for i in range(68, 40, -1):\n                if num_list[i] % 2 == 1:\n                    last_odd = num_list[i]\n                    break\n\n            # create a new list with all odd numbers from index 41 to index 69, exclusive\n            for i in range(41, 69):\n                if num_list[i] % 2 == 1 and num_list[i] != first_odd and num_list[i] != last_odd:\n                    odd_nums.append(num_list[i])\n\n            if not odd_nums:\n                return []  # no odd numbers found in the specified range\n\n            return odd_nums\n        ```\n\nThis Python code contains comments, which are not requested by the problem. The Python code also contains a variable `odd_nums`, which is not defined in the problem. The Python code also has an invalid index in the loop at `for i in range(68, 40, -1):`. The correct index should be `for i in range(68, 41, -1):`. Finally, the code includes unnecessary conditional statements that check if the first and last odd numbers are in the list. This can be simplified by checking if the first and last odd numbers are equal to `None`.\n\nHere is the improved Python code:\n\n```python\ndef all_odd_ints_exclusive(num_list):\n    first_odd = None\n    last_odd = None\n\n    for i in range(41, 69):\n        if num_list[i] % 2 == 1:\n            if first_odd is None:\n                first_odd = num_list[i]\n            last_odd = num_list[i]\n\n    odd_nums = []\n    for i in range(41, 69):\n        if num_list[i] % 2 == 1 and num_list[i] != first_odd and num_list[i] != last_odd:\n            odd_nums.append(num_list[i])\n\n    if not odd_nums:\n        return []\n\n    return odd_nums\n```"
