The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 28 to index 32, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(lst):\n  sum = 0\n  for i in range(28, 33):\n    if i >= 0 and i <= len(lst) - 1 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n      sum += lst[i]\n  return sum\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the list from index 28 to 32, and for each index checks if the element at that index is within the bounds of the list and is even. It then adds the element to the sum."
