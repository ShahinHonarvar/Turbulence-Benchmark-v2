  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 75 to index 94, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n  even_nums = [num for num in nums[75:95] if num % 2 == 0]\n  return sum(even_nums) or 0\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as input.\n* It extracts the elements from index 75 to 94 (inclusive) using slicing.\n* It creates a new list containing only the even numbers from the specified range using a list comprehension.\n* If the list of even numbers is empty, it returns 0 using a logical OR operation. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the even numbers using the `sum` function."
