  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 246 to index 750, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n  sum = 0\n  for i in range(246, 751):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n      sum += nums[i]\n  return sum if sum else 0\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code defines a function called `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as input. It initializes a variable `sum` to store the cumulative sum of even numbers.\n\nThe function then enters a `for` loop that iterates over the indices from 246 to 750, both inclusive. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index is even by checking if the remainder of the division by 2 is 0. If the index is even, it adds the corresponding element from the input list to the `sum` variable.\n\nAfter iterating over the entire range, the function returns the value of `sum`. If `sum` is 0, it indicates that no even numbers were found within the specified range, so the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the calculated sum."
