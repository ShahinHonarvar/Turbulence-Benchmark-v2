  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 30 to index 200, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(30, 201):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += nums[i]\n            \n    return total if total else 0\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers within a specified range, from index 30 to 200, inclusive.\n* It initializes a variable `total` to hold the running sum.\n* It iterates over the list from index 30 to 200 (inclusive) using a `for` loop.\n* Inside the loop, it checks if the current index is even using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is even, it adds the corresponding element from the list to the `total` variable.\n* After iterating through the entire list, it returns the `total` if it is not empty. If `total` is empty (no even numbers found), it returns 0."
