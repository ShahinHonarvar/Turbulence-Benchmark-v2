  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 30 to index 48, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n    return sum([num for num in nums[30:49] if num % 2 == 0]) or 0\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `sum_even_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as input.\n* It uses list slicing (nums[30:49]) to extract a sublist from index 30 to 48 (inclusive).\n* It uses a list comprehension to filter out odd numbers from the sublist and get even numbers.\n* The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the even numbers in the sublist.\n* There is a `or` operator to handle the case where the sublist doesn\'t contain any even numbers. If the list is empty or doesn\'t contain any even numbers in the specified range, the function returns 0."
