  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 35 to index 49, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\nimport math\n\ndef sum_even_ints_inclusive(int_list):\n    even_nums = [num for num in int_list[35:50] if num % 2 == 0]\n    return sum(even_nums, 0) if even_nums else 0\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `sum_even_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of even integers from index 35 to 49, inclusive.\n* It creates a list comprehension `[num for num in int_list[35:50] if num % 2 == 0]` to get even numbers from index 35 to 49.\n* If the list comprehension `even_nums` is not empty, it calculates the sum of `even_nums` using the built-in `sum` function with an initial value of 0.\n* If `even_nums` is empty, it returns 0."
