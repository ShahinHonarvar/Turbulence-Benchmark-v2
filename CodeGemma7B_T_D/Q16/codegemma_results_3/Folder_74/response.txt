The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'sum_even_ints_inclusive\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 17 to index 78, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):\n            sum_even = 0\n            for i in range(17, 79):\n                if nums[i] % 2 == 0:\n                    sum_even += nums[i]\n            return sum_even\n        ```\n        The provided Python code starts with the `def` keyword and ends with a `return` statement. The keyword `def` is used to define a new function in Python. The name of the function is `sum_even_ints_inclusive`. The keyword `parameters` is used to specify the argument that the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function takes. In this case, the argument is `nums`. The `return` statement is used to return the value that the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function calculates. The value that is returned is the sum of all even integers from index 17 to index 78, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0."
