The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_not_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by 9 from index 60 to index 200, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code:\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n  return [num for num in nums[60:200] if num % 9 != 0]\n```\n\nThe code first selects the range of elements from the list at index 60 to index 200, exclusive. Then, it checks if each number in this range is not divisible by 9. If it is not divisible by 9, the number is included in the result list. If no numbers in the specified range are not divisible by 9, the result list is empty."
