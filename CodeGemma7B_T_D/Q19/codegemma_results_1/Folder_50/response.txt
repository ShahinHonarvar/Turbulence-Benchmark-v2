  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_not_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by 44 from index 13 to index 76, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Almost there! However, the question asks for a function that takes a list as input, not a specific list. To accommodate different input lists, the function should not hardcode any indices of the list. Instead, it should use slicing to extract the sublist from the specified indices. Based on this, the following code should work:\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(num_list):\n    return num_list[13:76][num_list[13:76]%44 != 0]\n```\nAny modifications to the code are not required for this iteration."
