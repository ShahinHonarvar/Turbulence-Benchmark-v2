  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_not_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by 93 from index 45 to index 72, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(list_of_ints):\n  new_list = []\n  for i in range(45, 73):\n    if i not in [a for a in list_of_ints if a % 93 == 0]:\n      new_list.append(i)\n  if new_list == []:\n    return []\n  else:\n    return new_list\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function takes a list of integers as input.\n* It initializes an empty list called `new_list`.\n* It iterates through the range of indices from 45 to 72 (exclusive).\n* For each index, it checks if the corresponding integer in the input list is not divisible by 93.\n* If the integer is not divisible by 93, it is appended to the `new_list`.\n* If the `new_list` is empty after the iteration, it means no such integers exist in the specified range, so an empty list is returned.\n* Otherwise, the `new_list` is returned, containing the integers not divisible by 93 from index 45 to 72."
