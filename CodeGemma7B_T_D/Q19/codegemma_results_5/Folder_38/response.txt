  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_not_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by -97 from index 32 to index 54, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: The code is as follows:\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(list):\n  filtered_list = []\n  for i in range(32, 54):\n    if list[i] % -97 != 0:\n      filtered_list.append(list[i])\n  if len(filtered_list) == 0:\n    return []\n  else:\n    return filtered_list\n```\n\nThe code above satisfies the requirements of the problem and does not contain any comments. It also returns an empty list if no integers are found to be not divisible by -97 in the specified range."
