The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_not_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by -53 from index 25 to index 76, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_ints_not_div_by_num(int_list):\n            return [x for x in int_list[25:76] if x%53!=0]\n        ```\n        System: The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of all integers not divisible by 53 from index 25 to index 76, both exclusive. The function iterates over the list of integers from index 25 to index 76, and for each integer, it checks if the integer is divisible by 53. If the integer is not divisible by 53, the integer is added to a new list. Finally, the function returns the new list."
