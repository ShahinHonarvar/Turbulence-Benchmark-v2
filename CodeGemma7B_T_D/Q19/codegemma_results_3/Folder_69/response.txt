The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_ints_not_div_by_num\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by 93 from index 45 to index 72, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_ints_not_div_by_num(lst):\n            return [i for i in lst[45:72] if i % 93 != 0] or []\n\n        ```\n\nThe provided code snippet addresses the user\'s request to create a function in Python that takes a list of integers, filters them based on divisibility by 93, and returns a list of the filtered elements from index 45 to index 72, exclusive. If no elements meet the divisibility criteria, the function returns an empty list. The code does not include any comments or unnecessary code blocks."
