  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_perfect_num\' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 985 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef is_perfect_num(lst):\n  return lst[984] % 2 == 0\n\nlst = [2, 4, 6, ..., 1970, 1972, 1974, 1976, 1978]\n\nprint(is_perfect_num(lst))\n```\n**Explanation:**\nThe code defines a function called `is_perfect_num` that takes a list of positive integers as its argument and returns True if the integer at index 984 is a perfect number, otherwise it returns False. The code then creates a list of positive integers and calls the `is_perfect_num` function on it."
