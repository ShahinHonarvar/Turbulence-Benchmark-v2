The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_perfect_num\' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 276 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def if_perfect_num(nums):\n            perfect_nums = [6, 28, 496, 8128]\n            if nums[276] in perfect_nums:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        ```\n\nThis is an example of the format in which I will provide questions. Please answer them in the same format, including the triple backticks for Python code."
