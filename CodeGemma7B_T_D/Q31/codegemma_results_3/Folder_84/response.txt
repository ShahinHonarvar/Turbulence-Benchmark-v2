  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_perfect_num\' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 685 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Essentially, the code should check if the number at index 685 in the input list element is a perfect number. The definition of a perfect number is that all its factors, excluding itself, should sum to its value (e.g., 6 = 1 + 2 + 3). Here\'s your code:\n\n```python\ndef if_perfect_num(lst):\n    ans = proper_factors(lst[685])\n    return ans == lst[685]\n\ndef proper_factors(num):\n    factors = [i for i in range(1, num) if num % i == 0]\n    return sum(factors)\n```"
