  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_perfect_num\' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 64 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def if_perfect_num(nums):\n        if nums[64] == perfect_num(nums[64]):\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n\n        def perfect_num(num):\n            sumOfDividers = 0\n            for divisor in range(1, num):\n                if num % divisor == 0:\n                    sumOfDividers += divisor\n            if sumOfDividers == num:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n        ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `if_perfect_num` function takes a list of positive integers as input. It accesses the element at index 64 and calls the `perfect_num` function to check if it is a perfect number. If the result is true, `if_perfect_num` returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.\n\nThe `perfect_num` function calculates the sum of the divisors of a given number. It iterates through all the numbers from 1 to the input number - 1. If the remainder when the input number is divided by the current number is 0, the current number is added to the sum of divisors. If the sum of divisors equals the input number, the number is perfect and `perfect_num` returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`."
