The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'if_perfect_num\' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 8 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def if_perfect_num(num_list):\n            num_list[8] = num_list[8] + 1\n            return True\n        ```\n\nThis code is not perfect because it doesn\'t check if the integer at index 8 is indeed a perfect number. The corrected code below:\n\n```python\ndef is_perfect_num(num_list):\n    num = num_list[8]\n    perfect_num = True\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            perfect_num = False\n    return perfect_num\n```"
