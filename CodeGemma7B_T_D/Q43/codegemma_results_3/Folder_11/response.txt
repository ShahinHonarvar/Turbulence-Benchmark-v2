  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_primes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 55 to index 76, both inclusive. The returned list should be in ascending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def find_primes_between_indices(nums):\n            prime_nums = []\n            for num in nums[55:77+1]:\n                if is_prime(num) and num not in prime_nums:\n                    prime_nums.append(num)\n            return sorted(prime_nums)\n        ```\nNote that this is a template for the code that you would need to generate. You will need to replace `<text specification>` with the actual text specification that you are given."
