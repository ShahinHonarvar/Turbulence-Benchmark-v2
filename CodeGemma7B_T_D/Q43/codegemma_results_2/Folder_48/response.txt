  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_primes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 261 to index 459, both inclusive. The returned list should be in ascending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(list_of_integers):\n  primes = []\n  for number in list_of_integers[261:460]:\n    is_prime = True\n    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5)+1):\n      if number % i == 0:\n        is_prime = False\n        break\n    if is_prime:\n      primes.append(number)\n  return sorted(primes) or []\n```\n    End of Python code\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `find_primes_between_indices` function takes a list of integers as input.\n* It creates an empty list called `primes` to store prime numbers found within the specified range.\n* It iterates through each number in the list of integers from index 261 to 459 (inclusive) using a slice operation.\n* For each number, it initializes a Boolean variable `is_prime` to `True`.\n* It then iterates through all the numbers from 2 up to the square root of the current number (inclusive).\n* If the current number is divisible by any of these numbers without a remainder, it means it\'s not prime, and it sets `is_prime` to `False`.\n* If `is_prime` remains `True`, it means the number is prime. It then appends the prime number to the `primes` list.\n* After iterating through all numbers in the specified range, it sorts the `primes` list in ascending order using the `sorted()` function and returns it. If the `primes` list is empty, it returns an empty list instead."
