The function works by iterating over the list of integers in the specified range and checking if each number is prime. To determine if a number is prime, the function iterates over all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive) and checks if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is considered prime. The prime numbers are then added to a list, and the list is then sorted and returned. If no prime numbers are found in the specified range, the function returns an empty list."
