  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_primes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 424 to index 552, both inclusive. The returned list should be in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(list):\n    primes = sorted([num for num in list[424:553] if all(num % i != 0 for i in range(2, num))], reverse=True)\n    return primes if primes else []\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code defines a function named `find_primes_between_indices` that takes a single argument, a list of integers. It then initializes an empty list named `primes` to store the prime numbers within the specified range.\n\nNext, the code iterates over the elements from index 424 to index 552, inclusive, using a list comprehension. Each element in this iteration is checked to be divisible by any number from 2 to itself using a generator expression inside the `all` function. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is considered prime.\n\nThe `sorted` function is then called on the resulting list of prime numbers with the `reverse` argument set to `True`. This sorts the list in descending order.\n\nFinally, the function checks if the `primes` list is empty. If it is not empty, it returns the sorted list of prime numbers. Otherwise, it returns an empty list."
