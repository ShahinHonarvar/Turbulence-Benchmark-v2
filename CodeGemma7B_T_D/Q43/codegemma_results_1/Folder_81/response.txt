  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_primes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 59 to index 97, both inclusive. The returned list should be in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: As an expert in Python programming, I would be happy to help you with this task. Here is the Python code for the given problem:\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(nums):\n    primes = [num for num in nums[59:98] if all(num % i for i in range(2, num))]\n    if primes:\n        primes.sort(reverse=True)\n    else:\n        primes = []\n    return primes\n```"
