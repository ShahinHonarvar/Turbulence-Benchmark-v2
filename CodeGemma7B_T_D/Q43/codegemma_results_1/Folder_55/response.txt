  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_primes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 2 to index 2, both inclusive. The returned list should be in ascending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(nums):\n  primes = []\n  for i in range(2, 3):\n    if is_prime(nums[i]):\n      primes.append(nums[i])\n  primes.sort()\n  return primes\n\ndef is_prime(num):\n  if num <= 1:\n    return False\n  for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n    if num % i == 0:\n      return False\n  return True\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The `find_primes_between_indices` function takes a list of integers as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list called `primes` to store prime numbers within the specified indices.\n3. It iterates through the list from index 2 to 2, inclusive, to avoid unnecessary computations for non-prime numbers.\n4. For each element in the range, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if it\'s a prime number.\n5. If the element is prime, it\'s appended to the `primes` list.\n6. After processing all elements in the range, the `primes` list is sorted and returned.\n7. The `is_prime` function determines if a number is prime by checking if it\'s divisible by any number between 2 and its square root.\n8. If no prime number is found in the specified range, an empty list is returned."
