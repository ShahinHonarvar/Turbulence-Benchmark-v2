  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_primes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 0 to index 1, both inclusive. The returned list should be in ascending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSolution:\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(list_of_integers):\n  prime_numbers = []\n  for number in list_of_integers:\n    if number <= 1:\n      continue\n    is_prime = True\n    for i in range(2, number):\n      if number % i == 0:\n        is_prime = False\n        break\n    if is_prime:\n      prime_numbers.append(number)\n  return sorted(prime_numbers)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The function `find_primes_between_indices` takes one argument, `list_of_integers`, which is a list of integers.\n* It initializes an empty list `prime_numbers` to store the prime numbers found in the specified range.\n* It iterates over each number in the `list_of_integers` starting from 0 to the last one.\n* For each number, it checks if it is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the number is not prime (except 2) and the `continue` statement skips the remaining checks for that number.\n* It then checks if the number is prime by iterating from 2 up to the number itself and checking for any divisors.\n* If the number is prime, it appends it to the `prime_numbers` list.\n* Finally, it sorts the `prime_numbers` list and returns it. If no prime numbers were found during the iteration, it returns an empty list."
