  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_primes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 16 to index 25, both inclusive. The returned list should be in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(int_list):\n    primes = []\n    for ind_num in range(16, 26):\n        num = int_list[ind_num]\n        if num <= 1:\n            continue\n\n        is_prime = True\n        for divisor in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n            if num % divisor == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n\n        if is_prime:\n            primes.append(num)\n\n    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)\n```\n\nThis code first defines a function called `find_primes_between_indices` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 16 to index 25, both inclusive. The code then iterates through the specified range of indices and checks if each number is prime. The function implements the primality test algorithm, which involves checking if the number is divisible by any number from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any such divisor is found, the number is not prime; otherwise, it is prime. The prime numbers are then appended to a list called `primes`. Finally, the code returns the sorted list of prime numbers in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned."
