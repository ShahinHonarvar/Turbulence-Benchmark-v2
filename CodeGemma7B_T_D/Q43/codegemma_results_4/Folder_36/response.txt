The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_primes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 229 to index 850, both inclusive. The returned list should be in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\n<The function should be named \'find_primes_between_indices\' and should have the following logic.>\n        <1. Create an empty list to store the prime numbers.>\n        <2. Iterate through the list from index 229 to index 850 (inclusive). For each number in this range, check if it is prime. A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has only two factors: 1 and itself. You can use the following logic to check if a number is prime or not.>\n        <If a number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime. >\n        <If a number is greater than 1, iterate through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number.
