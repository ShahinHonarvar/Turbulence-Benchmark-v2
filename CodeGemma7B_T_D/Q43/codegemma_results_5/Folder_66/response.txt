  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'find_primes_between_indices\' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 72 to index 72, both inclusive. The returned list should be in ascending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code you requested:\n```python\ndef find_primes_between_indices(num_list):\n    primes = []\n    for num in num_list[72:73]:\n        if num % 2 != 0 and num % 3 != 0 and num % 5 != 0 and num % 7 != 0:\n            primes.append(num)\n    return sorted(primes)\n```\n\n\nNow, we can use this function to find all prime numbers between indices 72 and 72 in a list:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]\nprimes = find_primes_between_indices(my_list)\n\nprint(primes)\n```\n\nThis will output the following result:\n\n```\n[]\n```"
