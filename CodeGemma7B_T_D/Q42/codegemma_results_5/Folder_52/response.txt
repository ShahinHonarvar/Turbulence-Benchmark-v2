  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'prime_factors\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 478.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef prime_factors(numbers):\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number == numbers[478]:\n            for divisor in range(2, number + 1):\n                if number % divisor == 0:\n                    factors = set()\n                    while number % divisor == 0:\n                        factors.add(divisor)\n                        number //= divisor\n                    return factors\n\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The code defines a function `prime_factors` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n* Inside the function, the code iterates over the list and checks if the current number in the list is the one at index 478.\n* If the condition is true, the code performs a trial division from 2 up to the current number to find all the prime factors.\n* The code uses a set to store the prime factors and to ensure uniqueness of factors.\n* The code returns the set of prime factors of the number at index 478."
