  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'prime_factors\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 1.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n    return set(prime_factorize(nums[1]))\n\ndef prime_factorize(num):\n    factor = 2\n    factors = set()\n    while factor * factor <= num:\n        while num % factor == 0:\n            factors.add(factor)\n            num //= factor\n        factor += 1\n    if num != 1:\n        factors.add(num)\n    return factors\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* `prime_factors` is a function that takes a list of integers and returns the set of prime factors of the second element in the list.\n* `prime_factorize` is a helper function that takes an integer and returns the set of prime factors of the integer.\n* The `while` loop in `prime_factorize` iterates over the prime factors of the integer.\n* The `factors` set is used to store the prime factors of the integer.\n* The `if` statement in `prime_factorize` handles the case where the integer is prime.\n* The `return` statement in `prime_factorize` returns the set of prime factors of the integer."
