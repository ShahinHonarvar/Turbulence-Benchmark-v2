  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'prime_factors\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 56.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n  return set(factorize(num) for num in nums[56])\n\ndef factorize(n):\n  for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n    if n % i == 0:\n      return {i}.union(factorize(n // i))\n  return {n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `prime_factors` function takes a list of integers `nums` as input.\n* It extracts the integer at the 56th index of `nums` and passes it to the `factorize` function.\n* The `factorize` function recursively decomposes the input integer `n` into prime factors. It starts by checking for factors in the range [2, âˆšn], and if a factor is found, it recursively factors the quotient of `n` by that factor.\n* The `factorize` function returns a set containing all the prime factors of `n`.\n* The `prime_factors` function then returns the set of prime factors obtained from the `factorize` function."
