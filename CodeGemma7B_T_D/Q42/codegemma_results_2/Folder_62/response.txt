  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'prime_factors\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 926.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n  prime_fac = set()\n  check_num = nums[926]\n  factor = 2\n\n  while check_num > 1:\n    if check_num % factor == 0:\n      prime_fac.add(factor)\n      check_num = check_num // factor\n    else:\n      factor += 1\n\n  return prime_fac\n```\n\nLet\'s think step by step.\n1. **Define a Function:** Define a function called `prime_factors` that takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. **Extract the Number:** Access the element at index 926 from the input list and store it in the variable `check_num`.\n3. **Initialize Factors:** Create an empty set called `prime_fac` to store the prime factors.\n4. **Prime Factorization:** Use a while loop to iterate until `check_num` becomes 1. Inside the loop, check if `check_num` is divisible by the current factor. If it is, add the factor to the `prime_fac` set and divide `check_num` by the factor. Otherwise, increment the factor by 1.\n5. **Return Factors:** After factoring out all the prime factors, return the `prime_fac` set.\n\n**Note:** This solution assumes that the input list contains at least 926 elements. If there are not enough elements, the code will raise an IndexError."
