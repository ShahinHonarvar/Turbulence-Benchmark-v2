  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'prime_factors\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 48.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n    index = 48\n    return set(factor for factor in nums[index] if factor > 1 and all(factor % num != 0 for num in range(2, factor)))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The code defines a function named `prime_factors` that takes a single argument, `nums`, which is a list of integers.\n2. **Index Retrieval**: It sets the index variable to `48`, representing the desired index in the `nums` list.\n3. **Prime Factor Generation**: It uses a generator expression to iterate over the elements at the specified index (`nums[index]`). For each element, it checks:\n    - If the element is greater than 1 (excluding 1, which is not prime).\n    - If the element is not divisible by any number in the range of 2 to the element itself (inclusive). This ensures that the element is prime.\n4. **Set Conversion**: The generator expression results in a set of prime factors. Since the problem requires a set, the result is converted to a set using `set()`."
