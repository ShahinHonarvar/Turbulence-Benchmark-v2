  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'prime_factors\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 2.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n  num = nums[2]\n  factors = set()\n  for i in range(2, int(num**0.5)+1):\n    while num % i == 0:\n      factors.add(i)\n      num //= i\n  if num > 1:\n    factors.add(num)\n  return factors\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code defines a function called `prime_factors` that takes a list of positive integers as its argument. The first line retrieves the integer at index 2, which is the one we need to find the prime factors of.\n\nThe second line initializes an empty set to store the prime factors as we iterate over the integers from 2 up to the square root of the target integer.\n\nThe third line enters a loop that iterates over the integers from 2 to the square root of the target integer (inclusive).\n\nInside the loop, we check if the target integer is divisible by the current integer. If it is, we add the current integer to the set of prime factors and update the target integer by dividing it by the current integer.\n\nThe loop continues until we have checked all integers up to the square root of the target integer.\n\nAfter the loop, we check if the target integer is greater than 1. If it is, it means the target integer itself is a prime factor, and we add it to the set of prime factors.\n\nFinally, the function returns the set of prime factors found.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThis code assumes that the input list contains at least three elements, as the function expects to retrieve the integer at index 2. If the list contains fewer than three elements, the code will raise an IndexError."
