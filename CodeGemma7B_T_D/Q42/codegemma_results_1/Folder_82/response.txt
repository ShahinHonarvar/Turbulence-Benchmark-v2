  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'prime_factors\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 83.>\nOutput:\n```python\ndef prime_factors(nums):\n    result = set()\n    for prime in nums[83]:\n        result.add(prime)\n    return result\n\nnums = [i for i in range(1000, 0, -1)]\nprint(prime_factors(nums))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `prime_factors` function takes a list of numbers as input and initializes an empty set called `result`.\n* It then iterates through the elements at index 83 in the `nums` list.\n* For each element (prime factor), it adds it to the `result` set.\n* Finally, it returns the `result` set, containing the unique prime factors of the integer at index 83 in the `nums` list.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n* The code creates a list of positive integers called `nums` with values from 1000 to 1, decrementing by 1.\n* It then calls the `prime_factors` function with the `nums` list as input.\n* The `prime_factors` function returns the set of prime factors of the integer at index 83 in the `nums` list.\n* The result is printed to the console."
