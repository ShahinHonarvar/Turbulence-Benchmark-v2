  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'prime_factors\' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 1.>\nOutput:\n# Expected output: {2, 3}\n        ```python\n        factor_set = set()\n        for factor in range(2, int(nums[1]) ** 0.5 + 1):\n            if nums[1] % factor == 0:\n                factor_set.add(factor)\n                factor_set.add(nums[1] // factor)\n        return factor_set\n        ```\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. We initialize an empty set called `factor_set` to store the prime factors of the integer at index 1.\n\n2. We iterate through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the integer at index 1. If the integer is not prime, we can stop iterating because all prime factors would have already been found.\n\n3. For each number in the loop, we check if the integer at index 1 is divisible by the current number without a remainder. If it is, we add the current number and its corresponding factor (integer at index 1 divided by the current number) to the `factor_set`.\n\n4. Finally, we return the `factor_set`, which contains the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 1."
