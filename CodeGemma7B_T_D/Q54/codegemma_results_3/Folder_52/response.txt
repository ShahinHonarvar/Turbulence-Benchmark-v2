  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 52. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code for the given text specification:\n```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(z):\n\tx = z[52]\n\ta = []\n\tfor n in range(2,x):\n\t\tif prime(n):\n\t\t\tfor i in range(1,len(str(n))):\n\t\t\t\tif prime(int(str(n)[:-i])):\n\t\t\t\t\ta.append(n)\n\t\t\t\telse:\n\t\t\t\t\tbreak\n\treturn sorted(a)[::-1] if a else []\n```\n\nHere, we have defined a function called `all_right_truncatable_prime` which takes a tuple of integers as an argument. The integer at index 52 is stored in the variable `x`. Then, we create an empty list `a` which will store the right-truncatable prime numbers.\n\nNext, we iterate through all the numbers from 2 to `x` to check if they are prime numbers. If a number is prime, we iterate through all the possible rightmost digits of that number. If the number remaining after removing the rightmost digit is also prime, we append it to the list `a`.\n\nFinally, we return the sorted list `a` in descending order. If the list is empty, we return an empty list."
