The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 835. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list.
