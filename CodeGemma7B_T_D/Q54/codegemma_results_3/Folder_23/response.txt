The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 77. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem:\n```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(tN):\n    from sympy import S, factorint\n    left, right = tN\n    x = int(tN[77])\n    listR=[]\n    for i in range(left,right-1):\n        l = str(i)\n        if S(i).isprime() and S(l[:len(l)-1]).isprime():\n            listR.append(i)\n    listR.sort(reverse=True)\n    if not listR:\n        return[]\n    return listR\n```\n    System: Above is the code that checks if the number is a right-truncatable prime or not."
