Let x be the integer at index 54. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: As an expert in Python programming, I understand that the user is asking for a function that returns a sorted list of right-truncatable prime numbers less than a given number. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed. The function should sort the list of right-truncatable prime numbers in descending order and return an empty list if no such right-truncatable prime number exists. Here is the python code that meets the user\'s requirements: ```python\nfrom itertools import count\n\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(x: int) -> list[int]:\n    def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n        if n <= 1:\n            return False\n        for i in count(2):\n            if i * i > n:\n                break\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def right_truncatable(n: int) -> bool:\n        for i in range(1, len(str(n))):\n            if not is_prime(int(str(n)[:-i])):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    right_truncatable_primes = [n for n in range(2, x) if is_prime(n) and right_truncatable(n)]\n    return sorted(right_truncatable_primes, reverse=True)\n\n```"
