The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 73. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(x):\n    l=[]\n    for i in range(2,int(x/2)):\n        if isprime(i):\n            a=str(i)\n            b=a[:-1]\n            while len(b)>0 and int(b) in range(2,int(x/2)):\n                if isprime(int(b)):\n                    l.append(i)\n                b=b[:-1]\n    if len(l)==0:\n        return []\n    return sorted(l,reverse=True)\n\n```"
