The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 784. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```[\n2, 3, 2, 2, 43, 3, 7, 29, 417, 31, 53, 31, 2357, 29, 83, 4317, 871, 41, 2359, 241, 4319, 4337, 47, 717, 257, 4423, 977, 317, 479, 281, 431, 577, 263, 887, 811, 347, 151, 313, 4047, 157, 929, 821, 2361, 1523, 1543, 11, 647, 397, 4723, 1031, 4363, 927, 383, 173, 223, 4987, 857\n]```"
