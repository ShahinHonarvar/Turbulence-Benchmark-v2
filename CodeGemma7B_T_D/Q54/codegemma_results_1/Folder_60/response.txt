  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 87. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem:```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(nums):\n    x = nums[87]\n    primes = []\n    for i in range(2, x):\n        if is_prime(i):\n            for j in range(10**(len(str(i)) - 1), i):\n                if is_prime(int(str(i)[:-j])):\n                    primes.append(i)\n    return sorted(primes)\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n        System: The function `all_right_truncatable_prime` takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. It then extracts the integer at index 87 from the tuple and stores it in the variable `x`. A list of prime numbers is initialized.\n\nThe function iterates from 2 to `x-1` to check for prime numbers. For each prime number, it checks if it is a right-truncatable prime by iterating over the digits of the number from the second-to-last digit to the first digit. For each iteration, it removes the rightmost digit from the number and checks if it is a prime number. If it is a prime number, the prime number is added to the list of right-truncatable primes.\n\nFinally, the list of right-truncatable prime numbers is sorted and returned. If no right-truncatable prime numbers are found, an empty list is returned. The function `is_prime` is used to check if a number is prime."
