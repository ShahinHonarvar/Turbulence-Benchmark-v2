  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 71. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Based on the text specification, the following code has been generated:\n\n```python\nfrom math import sqrt\n\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(lst):\n    x = lst[71]\n\n    result = []\n    for i in range(2, x):\n        if is_prime(i):\n            str_i = str(i)\n            k = len(str_i)\n            for j in range(1, k):\n                num = int(str_i[:-j])\n                if not is_prime(num):\n                    break\n            else:\n                result.append(i)\n    \n    result.sort(reverse=True)\n    return result\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```"
