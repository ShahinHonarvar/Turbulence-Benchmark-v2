  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 24. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the requested Python code:\n```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(t):\n    x = t[24]\n    d = set(range(2, x)) - set(t[:24])\n    rtps = []\n    for c in t:\n        p = c\n        while p in d:\n            if len(str(p)) == 1:\n                rtps.append(c)\n                break\n            p //= 10\n    return sorted(rtps)\n```"
