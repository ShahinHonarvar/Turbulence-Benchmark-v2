The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 54. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code:\n```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(x):\n    import math\n    def is_prime(x):\n        if x <= 1:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):\n            if x % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    result = []\n    for num in x:\n        str_num = str(num)\n        for i in range(1, len(str_num)):\n            truncated_num = int(str_num[:-i])\n            if is_prime(truncated_num):\n                result.append(truncated_num)\n\n    return sorted(result)\n\n```"
