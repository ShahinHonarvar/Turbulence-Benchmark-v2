The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 91. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\n        def all_right_truncatable_prime(t): x, = t; y = int(str(x)[:-1])\n        def p(n): return (n>1) and all(n%i!=0 for i in range(3,int(n**0.5) + 1) if n%2!=0)\n        def rtp(n): return all(p(y) for y in range(x//10, n)) if p(x) else False\n        l=[]\n        for i in range(5,x):\n            if p(i) and rtp(i): l.append(i)\n        return sorted(l) if l else []\n        ```\n        User: Thank you! That\'s exactly what I wanted to see."
