The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 39. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Please be sure to include the list of the necessary libraries at the beginning of your code if they are not included by default.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(tp):\n    x = tp[39]\n    ret = []\n    for i in range(2, x):\n        if is_prime(i) and is_prime_truncatable(str(i)):\n            ret.append(i)\n    return sorted(ret, reverse=True)\n\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef is_prime_truncatable(num):\n    num = str(num)\n    for i in range(1, len(num)):\n        if not is_prime(int(num[:-i])):\n            return False\n    return True\n```"
