  string_value: "Prompt:\nSystem: You are an expert in Python programming. You are given a text specification surrounded by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 29. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here\'s the requested Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(t):\n    x = t[29]\n    truncatable = []\n    for n in range(2, x):\n        if isprime(n):\n            num = n\n            while num >= 10:\n                num = int(str(num)[:-1])\n                if not isprime(num): break\n            else:\n                truncatable.append(n)\n    return sorted(truncatable)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code utilizes the `sympy.isprime` function to check if a number is prime. It iterates through the numbers from 2 to `x - 1`, checking if each number is prime. If a number is prime, it iterates through the digits of the number from right to left, removing the last digit each time and checking if the remaining number is prime. If all the truncated numbers are prime, the original number is appended to the `truncatable` list. Finally, it returns the sorted list of all right-truncatable primes. If no right-truncatable primes are found, an empty list is returned."
