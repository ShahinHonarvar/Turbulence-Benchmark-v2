The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 14. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nOutput:\n```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(tup):\n    x = tup[14]\n    ret = [num for i, num in zip(range(2, x + 1), map(str, tup)) if len([digit for digit in num[:-1: -1] if int(digit) in tup[:tup.index(num)]]) == len(num[:-1:]) and all(num[:tup.index(num)] + p in tup for p in str(int(num) - i) if int(p) in tup[:tup.index(num)])]\n    ret.sort()\n    return ret if ret else []\n```"
