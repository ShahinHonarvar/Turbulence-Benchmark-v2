The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 28. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(x):\n    z = x[28]\n    Prime = []\n    for i in range(1, z):\n        for j in [i * 10 ** pos + a for pos in range(0, 5) for a in range(10)]:\n            if j >= z: continue\n            if j in Prime: continue\n            r = 1\n            for k in range(j + 1, z):\n                if k % j == 0: r = 0\n            if r == 1: Prime.append(j)\n    Prime.sort()\n    if Prime != []: return Prime else: return []\n```"
