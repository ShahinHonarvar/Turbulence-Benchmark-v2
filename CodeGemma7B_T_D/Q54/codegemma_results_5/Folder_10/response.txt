The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 38. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: ```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(t):\n    x = t[38]\n    truncate = set(str(i) for i in range(2, x) if all(int(str(i)[:-j]) in primes for j in range(1, len(str(i)))))\n    truncate.discard(2)\n    return sorted(truncate, reverse=True)\n\nprimes = set(range(2, x))\nfor i in range(4, int(x**0.5) + 1, 2):\n    primes.difference_update(range(i * i, x, i))\n```"
