The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.\n        User: <Write a function called \'all_right_truncatable_prime\' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 89. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.>\nOutput:\nSystem: Here is the Python code:\n```python\ndef all_right_truncatable_prime(a):\n    x = a[89]\n    prime = [True] * (2 * 10 ** 5 + 1)\n    prime[0] = prime[1] = False\n    for i in range(2, int(2 * 10 ** 5 + 0.5)):\n        if prime[i]:\n            for j in range(i * i, 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1, i):\n                prime[j] = False\n\n    for i in range(x - 1, 9, -1):\n        b = str(i)\n        for j in range(1, len(b)):\n            if not prime[int(b[j:])]:\n                break\n        else:\n            yield i\n```"
