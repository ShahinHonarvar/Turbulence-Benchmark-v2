Message(id='msg_019jgc7t5EHNDwzCron1s8vt', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s the Python implementation of the `insert_after_character` function:\n\n```python\ndef insert_after_character(s):\n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        result.append(char)\n        if char == \' \':\n            result.append(\' \')\n    return \'\'.join(result)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It creates an empty list called `result` to store the characters of the modified string.\n2. It iterates through each character in the input string.\n3. For each character, it first appends the character to the `result` list.\n4. If the character is a space, it appends another space immediately after it.\n5. Finally, it joins the characters in the `result` list into a single string and returns it.\n\nFor example:\n- `insert_after_character("hello world")` would return `"hello  world"`\n- `insert_after_character("a b c")` would return `"a  b  c"`\n- `insert_after_character("")` would return an empty string', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=106, output_tokens=245))
