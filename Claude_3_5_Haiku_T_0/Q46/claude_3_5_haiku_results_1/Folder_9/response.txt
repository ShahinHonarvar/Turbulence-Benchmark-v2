Defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm\n2. Defines another inner helper function `gcd_three` that calculates the GCD of three numbers by first finding the GCD of two numbers and then finding the GCD of that result with the third number\n3. Returns the GCD of the numbers at indices 66, 90, and 27 from the input list\n\nThe function assumes that the input list has at least 91 elements (since it accesses indices 66, 90, and 27) and that these elements are positive integers.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=105, output_tokens=257))
