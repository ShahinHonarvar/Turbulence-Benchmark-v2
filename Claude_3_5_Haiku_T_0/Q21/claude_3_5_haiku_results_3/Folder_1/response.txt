Message(id='msg_011S35BjdR259PqreftkRzuh', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[59:78] if num % -95 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 59 to 77 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in the slice to see if it is divisible by -95 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by -95, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by -95 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe slice `nums[59:78]` ensures that we look at elements from index 59 to 77, both inclusive, as specified in the problem statement.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=205))
