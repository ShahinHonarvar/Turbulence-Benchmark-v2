Message(id='msg_01F9Fy5BMz4UGBh29y1HdNgQ', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[25:60] if num % -26 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 25 to 59 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in the slice to see if it is divisible by -26 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by -26, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by -26 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as an argument\n- Checks divisibility by -26\n- Looks at the range from index 25 to 59\n- Returns a list of divisible integers or an empty list if none exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=227))
