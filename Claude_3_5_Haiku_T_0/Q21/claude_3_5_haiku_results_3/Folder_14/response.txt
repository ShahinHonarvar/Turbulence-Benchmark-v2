Message(id='msg_0163t8Bd2waJoacJ6Dp5v2hU', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    if len(nums) < 9:\n        return []\n    return [num for num in nums[8:9] if num % 8 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. First, it checks if the input list has at least 9 elements. If not, it returns an empty list.\n2. It uses a list comprehension to:\n   - Slice the list from index 8 to index 8 (which means just the 9th element)\n   - Check if that element is divisible by 8 (using the modulo operator %)\n3. If the element at index 8 is divisible by 8, it will be included in the returned list\n4. If the element is not divisible by 8, an empty list will be returned\n5. If the list has fewer than 9 elements, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets all the specified requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as input\n- Checks only the element at index 8\n- Returns a list of integers divisible by 8\n- Returns an empty list if no such integers exist or the list is too short", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=293))
