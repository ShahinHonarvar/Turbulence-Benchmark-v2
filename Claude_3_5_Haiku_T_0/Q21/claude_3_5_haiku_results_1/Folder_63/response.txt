Message(id='msg_0145WegmatuPPhqxmZZKDMKb', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[50:55] if num % 84 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 50 to 54 (inclusive)\n2. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by 84 using the modulo operator `%`\n3. If a number is divisible by 84 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it's included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers are divisible by 84 in the specified range, an empty list will be returned\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as input\n- Checks only the elements from index 50 to 54\n- Returns only integers divisible by 84\n- Returns an empty list if no such integers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=234))
