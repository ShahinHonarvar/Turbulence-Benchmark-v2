Message(id='msg_01GXMBCkYPkMHK1aLyqK62rn', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[421:490] if num % 885 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 421 to 490 (which includes indices 421 to 489)\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by 885 using the modulo operator\n4. If a number is divisible by 885 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it's included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers are divisible by 885 in the specified range, an empty list will be returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=191))
