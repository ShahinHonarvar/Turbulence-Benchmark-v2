Message(id='msg_01N5Bp8CQJHXhERtBbCGFesj', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[:1] if num % 8 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It only looks at the first element of the input list (nums[:1])\n3. It checks if the first element is divisible by 8 using the modulo operator (%)\n4. If the first element is divisible by 8, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no elements are divisible by 8, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as an argument\n- Checks divisibility by 8\n- Only looks at index 0\n- Returns an empty list if no divisible integers are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=208))
