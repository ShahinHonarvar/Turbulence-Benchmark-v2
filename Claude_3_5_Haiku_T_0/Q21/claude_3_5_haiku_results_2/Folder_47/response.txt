Message(id='msg_012JDanhezgHKU7BAaMRGH2D', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[75:89] if num % -27 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 75 to 88 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in the slice to see if it's divisible by -27 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by -27 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it's included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by -27 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as an argument\n- Checks only the integers from index 75 to 88\n- Returns only integers divisible by -27\n- Returns an empty list if no such integers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=234))
