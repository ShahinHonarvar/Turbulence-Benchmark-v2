Message(id='msg_018j5KmF3maA1L1DEKJwjD2p', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[23:66] if num % -46 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 23 to 65 (inclusive).\n2. It checks each number in this slice to see if it's divisible by -46 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by -46 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it's included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers are divisible by -46 in the specified range, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as an argument\n- Checks divisibility by -46\n- Looks only at indices 23 to 65 (inclusive)\n- Returns a list of divisible integers or an empty list if none exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=240))
