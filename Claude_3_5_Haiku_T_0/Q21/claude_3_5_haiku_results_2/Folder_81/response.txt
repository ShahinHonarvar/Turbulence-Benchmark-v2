Message(id='msg_01DkKHyCVP54b2VNyURzog9R', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[:3] if num % 5 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the first three elements of the input list (nums[:3])\n2. It checks each number to see if it's divisible by 5 using the modulo operator (num % 5 == 0)\n3. If a number is divisible by 5, it's included in the returned list\n4. If no numbers are divisible by 5 in the first three indices, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets all the specified requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as an argument\n- Checks only the first three elements (indices 0, 1, and 2)\n- Returns only integers divisible by 5\n- Returns an empty list if no such integers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=228))
