Message(id='msg_016MiyXSciNdNyqFspTq93Ur', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[18:94] if num % -85 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 18 to index 93 (inclusive) using `nums[18:94]`\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by -85 using the modulo operator `%`\n4. If a number is divisible by -85 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it's included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers are divisible by -85 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as input\n- Returns integers divisible by -85\n- Checks only the range from index 18 to 93 (inclusive)\n- Returns an empty list if no such integers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=251))
