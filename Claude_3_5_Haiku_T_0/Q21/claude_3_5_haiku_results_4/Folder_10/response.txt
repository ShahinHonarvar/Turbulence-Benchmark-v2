Message(id='msg_01QMjjpPJjSE9a1amJJoCVK7', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[42:90] if num % -59 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 42 to index 89 (90 is exclusive in Python slicing)\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by -59 using the modulo operator\n4. If a number is divisible by -59 (i.e., the remainder is 0), it's included in the result list\n5. If no numbers are divisible by -59 in the specified range, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets all the requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as input\n- Checks divisibility by -59\n- Looks only at indices 42 to 89\n- Returns an empty list if no divisible integers are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=131, output_tokens=242))
