Message(id='msg_01XuGgfjTT2gHm5YuxLQdac8', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[1:5] if num % 4 == 0 and num % -6 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 1 to index 4 (inclusive).\n2. For each number in this slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both 4 and -6 using the modulo operator.\n3. If a number is divisible by both 4 and -6, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Using list slicing `nums[1:5]` to get elements from index 1 to 4\n- Checking divisibility by both 4 and -6 with `num % 4 == 0 and num % -6 == 0`\n- Returning a list of numbers that meet these conditions", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=265))
