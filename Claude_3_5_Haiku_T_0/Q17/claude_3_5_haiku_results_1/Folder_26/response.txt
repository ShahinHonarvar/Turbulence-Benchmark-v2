Message(id='msg_01DySWsjYRw4EqjgLs1qHwke', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[69:71] if num % 72 == 0 and num % 70 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to filter the list\n2. It slices the input list from index 69 to 71 (which includes indices 69 and 70)\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by both 72 and 70\n4. If a number is divisible by both 72 and 70, it's included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets all the specified requirements:\n- Takes a list of integers as input\n- Checks only the elements at indices 69 and 70\n- Returns only integers divisible by both 72 and 70\n- Returns an empty list if no such integers exist", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=247))
