Message(id='msg_01UKw97WazoYQAj2meKwoPG5', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[:4] if num % 11 == 0 and num % -7 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It only considers the first 4 elements of the input list (from index 0 to 3, inclusive) using slice notation `nums[:4]`\n3. It checks each number to see if it's divisible by both 11 and -7 using the modulo operator `%`\n4. If a number is divisible by both 11 and -7, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function will work with lists of any length, always checking only the first 4 elements, and will return integers that are divisible by both 11 and -7 in that range.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=243))
