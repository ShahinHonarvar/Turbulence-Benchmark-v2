Message(id='msg_011chCsagZc7GX5TtkLaG17i', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    if len(nums) < 2:\n        return []\n    \n    divisor1, divisor2 = nums[0], nums[1]\n    \n    return [num for num in nums[:2] if num != 0 and num % divisor1 == 0 and num % divisor2 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. First, it checks if the input list has at least 2 elements. If not, it returns an empty list.\n2. It takes the first two numbers from the list as divisors.\n3. It uses a list comprehension to:\n   - Look only at the first two elements of the list (nums[:2])\n   - Exclude zero to avoid division by zero\n   - Check if each number is divisible by both divisors\n4. Returns the list of numbers that meet these conditions, or an empty list if no such numbers exist.\n\nThe function handles various scenarios:\n- If the list has fewer than 2 elements, it returns an empty list\n- It checks divisibility by both the first and second numbers in the list\n- It only considers the first two elements of the list\n- It avoids division by zero\n- It returns an empty list if no numbers are divisible by both divisors", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=324))
