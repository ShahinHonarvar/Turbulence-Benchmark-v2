Message(id='msg_0127vya5iu9SgUVeqvjZoYYT', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[306:958] if num % 982 == 0 and num % 319 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the slice of the input list from index 306 to 957 (inclusive).\n2. For each number in this slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both 982 and 319 using the modulo operator (%).\n3. If a number is divisible by both 982 and 319, it is included in the returned list.\n4. If no numbers meet the divisibility criteria, an empty list is returned.\n\nThe function takes a single argument `nums`, which is the input list of integers, and returns a list of integers that are divisible by both 982 and 319 within the specified index range.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=232))
