Message(id='msg_01NcX5BdSPhh2WECJgX3uivT', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[61:89] if num % 31 == 0 and num % 11 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 61 to index 88 (inclusive) using `nums[61:89]`\n3. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both 31 and 11 using the modulo operator `%`\n4. If a number is divisible by both 31 and 11 (i.e., the remainder is 0 for both divisions), it is included in the result list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=216))
