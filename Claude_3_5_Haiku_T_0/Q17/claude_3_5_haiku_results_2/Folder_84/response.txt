Message(id='msg_018x7ipS2AGmUXAr6NvDEnjM', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[78:82] if num % 76 == 0 and num % 60 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to filter the input list `nums`\n2. It slices the list from index 78 to 82 (which includes indices 78, 79, 80, and 81)\n3. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both 76 and 60 using the modulo operator `%`\n4. If a number is divisible by both 76 and 60, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=207))
