It uses a list comprehension to filter the input list `nums`\n2. It slices the list from index 42 to 44 (which includes indices 42 and 43)\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it's divisible by both 15 and 87\n4. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n5. If numbers are found that are divisible by both 15 and 87, they are included in the result list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=190))
