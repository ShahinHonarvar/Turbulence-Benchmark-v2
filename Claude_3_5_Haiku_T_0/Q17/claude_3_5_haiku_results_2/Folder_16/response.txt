Message(id='msg_012bUkxvrHgZkF7z14JjQgCE', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[55:81] if num % 22 == 0 and num % 32 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 55 to 81 (which includes indices 55 to 80)\n3. For each number in that slice, it checks if the number is divisible by both 22 and 32\n4. If a number is divisible by both 22 and 32, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe conditions `num % 22 == 0 and num % 32 == 0` ensure that the number is divisible by both 22 and 32 with no remainder.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=233))
