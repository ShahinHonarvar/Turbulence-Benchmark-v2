Message(id='msg_0194DNSx9z4qTvarEsREpdRB', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[543:585] if num % -553 == 0 and num % -737 == 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to filter the input list `nums`\n2. It slices the list from index 543 to 585 (which includes indices 543 to 584)\n3. It checks each number in the slice to see if it's divisible by both -553 and -737\n4. If a number is divisible by both, it's included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers are divisible by both, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function meets all the requirements specified in the original text description.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=201))
