The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n\n2. Inside the function, there's a nested `factor` function that finds the prime factors of a given number.\n\n3. The `factor` function works by:\n   - Starting with the smallest prime number (2)\n   - Dividing the number by the current divisor as many times as possible\n   - Adding the divisor to the set of prime factors each time\n   - Moving to the next potential divisor\n   - Handling cases where the remaining number is a prime larger than the square root of the original number\n\n4. The function returns the set of prime factors for the number at index 95 in the input list.\n\n5. The function handles finding prime factors efficiently by only checking divisors up to the square root of the number and handling any remaining prime factor.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=97, output_tokens=320))
