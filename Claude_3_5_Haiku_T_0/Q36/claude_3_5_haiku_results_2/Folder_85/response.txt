It creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. It iterates through the characters in the string from index 56 to 79 (indices 55 to 80 exclusive).\n3. If a character is greater than 'S' and smaller than 's', it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n4. It creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, preserving the original order.\n5. The modified string is returned.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=152, output_tokens=253))
