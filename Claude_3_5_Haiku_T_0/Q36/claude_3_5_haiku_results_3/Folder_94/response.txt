It creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. It iterates through the string from index 16 to 84 (exclusive).\n3. For each character in this range, if the character is greater than 'I' and less than 'M', it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n4. It then creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set, preserving the original order.\n5. Finally, it returns the modified string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=153, output_tokens=254))
