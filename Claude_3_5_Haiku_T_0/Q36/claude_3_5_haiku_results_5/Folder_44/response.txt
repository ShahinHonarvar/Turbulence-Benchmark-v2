Creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterates through the string from index 19 to 63 (exclusive of 18 and 64).\n3. If a character is greater than '3' and smaller than 'B', it is added to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n4. Creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set.\n5. Returns the modified string, maintaining the original order of characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=152, output_tokens=247))
