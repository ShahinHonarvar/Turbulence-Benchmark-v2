Creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterates through the string indices from 70 to 96 (exclusive of 97).\n3. For each character at those indices, checks if it is greater than 'V' and less than 'j'.\n4. If the condition is true, adds the character to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n5. Creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set.\n6. Returns the modified string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=153, output_tokens=254))
