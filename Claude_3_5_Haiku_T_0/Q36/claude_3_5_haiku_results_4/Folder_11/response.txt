Message(id='msg_011p7tpGkdABYaL6uFL4s62X', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `filter_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef filter_chars(s):\n    chars_to_remove = set()\n    for i in range(87, 93):\n        if 'E' < s[i] < '~':\n            chars_to_remove.add(s[i])\n    \n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_remove)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterates through the characters at indices 87 to 92 (exclusive of 86 and 93).\n3. For each character, checks if it is greater than 'E' and smaller than '~'.\n4. If the condition is true, adds the character to the `chars_to_remove` set.\n5. Creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in the `chars_to_remove` set.\n6. Returns the modified string.\n\nThe function preserves the order of characters in the original string while removing all occurrences of the specified characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=152, output_tokens=272))
