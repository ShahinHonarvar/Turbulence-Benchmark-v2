Message(id='msg_01WCn7k3PiaqR2jkfRt9rajx', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[104:574] if num % -514 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 104 to 574 (exclusive of the start and end indices)\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it is not divisible by -514\n4. If a number is not divisible by -514, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Using list slicing to get the range from index 103 to 574 (exclusive)\n- Using the modulo operator `%` to check divisibility\n- Returning an empty list if no numbers are found in the specified range that are not divisible by -514", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=235))
