Message(id='msg_01JK6TS9RfAJcPyzGqWCXWZy', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[19:60] if num % 86 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 19 to 60 (exclusive of index 18 and 60)\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it is not divisible by 86 (using the modulo operator %)\n4. If a number is not divisible by 86, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Starting at index 19 (which is the 20th element, after index 18)\n- Ending before index 60\n- Filtering out any numbers divisible by 86\n- Returning all remaining numbers as a new list", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=239))
