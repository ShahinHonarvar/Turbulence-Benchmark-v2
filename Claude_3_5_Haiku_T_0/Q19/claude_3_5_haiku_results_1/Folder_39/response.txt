Message(id='msg_01XFnX4smKjsdT5R3Jm6EKt8', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums[23:97] if num % -46 != 0]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list\n2. It slices the input list from index 23 to 97 (exclusive of index 22 and 97)\n3. It checks each number in that slice to see if it is not divisible by -46\n4. If a number is not divisible by -46, it is included in the returned list\n5. If no numbers meet the criteria, an empty list is returned\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Using list slicing to get the range from index 22 to 97 (exclusive)\n- Using the modulo operator `%` to check divisibility\n- Returning a list of numbers that are not divisible by -46 in the specified range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=134, output_tokens=234))
