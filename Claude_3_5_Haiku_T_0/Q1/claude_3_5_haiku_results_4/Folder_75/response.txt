Since the end index is exclusive in Python slicing, this effectively returns elements from index 56 to 98, which matches the requirement of being inclusive of both 56 and 98.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=173))
