Since the end index is exclusive in Python slicing, this effectively returns elements from index 22 to 63, which matches the requirement of being inclusive of both 22 and 63.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=177))
