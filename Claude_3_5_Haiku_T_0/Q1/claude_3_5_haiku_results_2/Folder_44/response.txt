In Python, this effectively means it includes indices 30 through 87, which matches the requirement of being inclusive of both 30 and 87.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=164))
