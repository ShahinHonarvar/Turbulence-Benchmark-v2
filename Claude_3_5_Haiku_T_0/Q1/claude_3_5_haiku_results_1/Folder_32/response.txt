This effectively includes indices 29 through 79, which matches the requirement of being inclusive from index 29 to index 79.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=165))
