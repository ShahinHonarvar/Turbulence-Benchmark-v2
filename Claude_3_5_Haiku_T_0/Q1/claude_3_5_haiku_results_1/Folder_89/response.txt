Since the end index is exclusive in Python slicing, this effectively returns elements from index 22 to 88, which matches the requirement of being inclusive of both those indices.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=168))
