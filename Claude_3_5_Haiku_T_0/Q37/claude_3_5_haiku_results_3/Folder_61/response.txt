Creates an empty set `chars_to_remove` to store characters that need to be removed.\n2. Iterates through indices 5 and 6 of the input string.\n3. If a character at these indices is between 'G' and 'p' (inclusive), it is added to `chars_to_remove`.\n4. Creates a new string by joining only the characters that are not in `chars_to_remove`, preserving the original order.\n5. Returns the modified string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=157, output_tokens=232))
