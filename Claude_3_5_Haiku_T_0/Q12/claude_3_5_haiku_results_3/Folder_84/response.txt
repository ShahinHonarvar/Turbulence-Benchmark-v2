Takes a list of numbers as an argument\n2. Uses list slicing to extract elements from index 31 to 34 (inclusive)\n3. Uses the `min()` function to find the smallest number in that slice\n4. Returns the smallest number\n\nThe function will work with lists of any length, as long as they have at least 35 elements. If the list has fewer than 35 elements, it will raise an IndexError.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=144))
