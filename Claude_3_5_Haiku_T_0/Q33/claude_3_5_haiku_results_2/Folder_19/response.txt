Defines a string of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase)\n2. Creates an empty list to store the result\n3. Iterates through the string indices from 51 to 76 (77 is exclusive)\n4. Checks if:\n   - The index is within the string length\n   - The character at the index is a vowel\n   - The character is greater than '4' and less than or equal to '='\n5. If all conditions are met, the character is added to the result list\n6. Returns the list of vowels meeting the criteria", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=146, output_tokens=247))
