Defines a string of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase)\n2. Creates an empty list to store the result\n3. Iterates through the indices from 36 to 55 (inclusive of 36, exclusive of 56)\n4. Checks if:\n   - The index is within the string's length\n   - The character at the index is a vowel\n   - The character is greater than '+' and less than or equal to '/'\n5. If all conditions are met, appends the character to the result list\n6. Returns the list of vowels meeting the criteria", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=144, output_tokens=249))
