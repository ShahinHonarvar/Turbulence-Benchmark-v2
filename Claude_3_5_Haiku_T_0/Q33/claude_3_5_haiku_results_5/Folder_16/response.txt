Defines a string of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase)\n2. Creates an empty list to store the result\n3. Iterates through the string from index 133 to 305 (exclusive of 306)\n4. Checks if:\n   - The current index is within the string's length\n   - The character at the current index is a vowel\n   - The character is greater than 'c' and less than or equal to 'd'\n5. If all conditions are met, the character is added to the result list\n6. Returns the list of vowels meeting the criteria", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=144, output_tokens=253))
