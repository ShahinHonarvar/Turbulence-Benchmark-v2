Extract only the alphabetic characters from the first three indices of the input string (indices 0, 1, 2) and convert them to lowercase.\n\n2. Use a recursive backtracking approach to generate all possible palindromes:\n   - The `generate_palindromes` function takes the current string being built and the remaining letters.\n   - If the current string is at least 3 characters long and has an odd length, check if it's a palindrome.\n   - If it is a palindrome, add it to the `palindromes` set.\n   - Recursively generate new strings by adding each remaining letter.\n\n3. Start the generation with an empty string and the extracted letters.\n\n4. Return the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function handles case-insensitivity by converting letters to lowercase, ensures palindromes are at least 3 characters long, and only uses letters from the first three indices of the input string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=199, output_tokens=395))
