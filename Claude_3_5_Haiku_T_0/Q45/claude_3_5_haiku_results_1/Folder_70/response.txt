Extract only the alphabetic characters from indices 1 to 6 (inclusive) of the input string, converting them to lowercase.\n\n2. Use a recursive backtracking approach to generate all possible arrangements of these letters.\n\n3. For each arrangement, check if it:\n   - Is at least 4 characters long\n   - Has an even length (to form a palindrome)\n   - Is a palindrome when read forwards and backwards\n\n4. Add valid palindromes to a set to ensure uniqueness.\n\n5. Return the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function handles various input scenarios, including strings with non-alphabetic characters, and returns an empty set if no valid palindromes can be formed.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=199, output_tokens=344))
