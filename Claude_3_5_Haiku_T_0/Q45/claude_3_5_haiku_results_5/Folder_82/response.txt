Extract only the alphabetic characters from indices 1 to 6 (inclusive) of the input string, converting them to lowercase.\n\n2. Use a recursive backtracking approach to generate all possible arrangements of these letters.\n\n3. For each arrangement, check if:\n   - The length is at least 7\n   - The arrangement is an odd-length palindrome\n   - If both conditions are met, add the palindrome to the set\n\n4. Return the set of unique palindromes.\n\nThe function handles various input scenarios, including strings with non-alphabetic characters, and ensures case-insensitive palindrome generation.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=199, output_tokens=325))
