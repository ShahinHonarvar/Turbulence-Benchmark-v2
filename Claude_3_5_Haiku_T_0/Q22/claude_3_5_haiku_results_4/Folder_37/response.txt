Message(id='msg_01YaUcNeRbvAg6tqwXqyqs1L', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function according to the specification:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum_of_multiples(n):\n    return sum(n * i for i in range(1, 18))\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a positive integer `n` as input\n2. It uses a generator expression to create the first 17 positive multiples of `n`\n3. The `range(1, 18)` generates numbers from 1 to 17\n4. Each multiple is calculated by multiplying `n` with the numbers from 1 to 17\n5. The `sum()` function adds up all these multiples\n6. The total sum is returned\n\nFor example:\n- `find_sum_of_multiples(3)` would return the sum of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51\n- `find_sum_of_multiples(5)` would return the sum of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=103, output_tokens=306))
