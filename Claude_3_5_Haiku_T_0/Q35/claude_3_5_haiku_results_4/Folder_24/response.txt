Message(id='msg_0116UWQ98gTJR7eBD4cn9hEy', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 91:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[14:91]\n    char_counts = {}\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    repeated_chars = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char not in repeated_chars or s.index(char) < 14 or s.index(char) >= 91:\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. If the input string's length is 91 or less, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 14 and 91 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in the substring.\n\n5. It builds a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that are not repeated in the substring\n   - Keeping characters that appear before index 14 or at or after index 91\n   - Removing all occurrences of characters that are repeated in the substring and appear between indices 14 and 91\n\n6. It returns the modified string, preserving the original order of characters.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only considering the substring between indices 14 and 91\n- Removing all occurrences of characters that appear more than once in this substring\n- Maintaining the order of the original string\n- Handling edge cases like short strings", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=422))
