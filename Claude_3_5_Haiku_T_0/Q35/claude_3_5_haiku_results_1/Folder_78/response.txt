If the input string is shorter than 64 characters, it returns the original string.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 62 and 96 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in the substring.\n\n5. It builds a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that are not repeated in the substring\n   - Keeping characters that appear before index 63 or at or after index 96\n   - Removing all occurrences of characters that are repeated in the substring and appear between indices 63 and 96\n\n6. It returns the modified string, preserving the original order of characters.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by removing repeated characters only from the specified range while maintaining the order of the original string.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=385))
