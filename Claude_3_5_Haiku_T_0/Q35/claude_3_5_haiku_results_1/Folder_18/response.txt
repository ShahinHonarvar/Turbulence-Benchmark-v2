Message(id='msg_016b9ckSoff3Apxw7g8cwtcC', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 56:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[57:90]\n    char_counts = {}\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    repeated_chars = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in repeated_chars or s.index(char) < 57 or s.index(char) >= 90)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. If the input string is shorter than or equal to 56 characters, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 57 and 90 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in the substring.\n\n5. It creates a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that are not repeated in the substring\n   - Keeping the first occurrence of repeated characters before index 57\n   - Keeping the first occurrence of repeated characters after index 90\n\n6. It returns the resulting string, maintaining the original order of characters.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by removing all occurrences of characters that are repeated more than once in the specified substring, while preserving the order of the remaining characters.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=368))
