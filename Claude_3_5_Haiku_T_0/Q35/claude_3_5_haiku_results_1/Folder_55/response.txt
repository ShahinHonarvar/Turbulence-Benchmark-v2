If the input string is 11 characters or shorter, return the original string.\n\n2. Extract the substring between indices 11 and 100 (exclusive).\n\n3. Count the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. Identify characters that appear more than once in this substring.\n\n5. Create a new list to build the result string:\n   - If a character is not in the repeated characters set, add it.\n   - If a character is in the repeated set but its first occurrence is outside the 11-100 range, add it.\n   - If a character is in the repeated set and its first occurrence is within the 11-100 range, skip it.\n\n6. Join the result list into a string and return it.\n\nThe function preserves the order of characters in the original string while removing repeated characters from the specified range.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=410))
