Message(id='msg_01YS6WU4vfynd9gG5cfbXFwN', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    substring = s[91:97]\n    repeat_chars = set(char for char in substring if substring.count(char) > 1)\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char not in repeat_chars)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. Extracts the substring between indices 91 and 97 (exclusive)\n2. Identifies characters that appear more than once in this substring\n3. Creates a new string by keeping only characters that are not in the set of repeated characters\n4. Preserves the original order of characters in the string\n\nThe function meets the requirements by:\n- Taking a single string argument\n- Checking for repeated characters in the specified index range\n- Removing all occurrences of those repeated characters\n- Maintaining the original order of characters in the result", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=218))
