Message(id='msg_01C5ocvr61HZvzdXyp548KWP', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 56:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[57:88]\n    char_counts = {}\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    repeated_chars = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char not in repeated_chars:\n            result.append(char)\n        elif s.index(char) < 57 or s.index(char) >= 88:\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. If the input string is shorter than or equal to 56 characters, it returns the original string.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 57 and 88 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in the substring.\n\n5. It builds a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that are not repeated in the substring\n   - Keeping repeated characters that are outside the specified index range\n   - Removing repeated characters within the specified index range\n\n6. It returns the modified string, preserving the original order of characters.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by checking the index of each character and its occurrence in the specified substring, removing repeated characters only within the given index range.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=385))
