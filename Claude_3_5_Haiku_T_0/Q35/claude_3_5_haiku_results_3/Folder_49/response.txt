Message(id='msg_01XQ2pJwBhjiaqfxLEnUmEFQ', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef remove_repeat_chars(s):\n    if len(s) <= 91:\n        return s\n    \n    substring = s[91:200]\n    char_counts = {}\n    \n    for char in substring:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n    \n    repeated_chars = {char for char, count in char_counts.items() if count > 1}\n    \n    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in repeated_chars or s.index(char) < 91 or s.index(char) >= 200)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. If the input string is 91 characters or shorter, it returns the original string unchanged.\n\n2. It extracts the substring between indices 91 and 200 (exclusive).\n\n3. It counts the occurrences of each character in this substring.\n\n4. It identifies characters that appear more than once in the substring.\n\n5. It creates a new string by:\n   - Keeping characters that are not in the repeated characters set\n   - Keeping repeated characters that appear before index 91 or at or after index 200\n   - Preserving the original order of characters\n\n6. It returns the resulting string.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Only considering characters between indices 90 and 200\n- Removing all occurrences of characters that appear multiple times in this range\n- Maintaining the original order of characters\n- Preserving characters outside the specified range", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=140, output_tokens=383))
