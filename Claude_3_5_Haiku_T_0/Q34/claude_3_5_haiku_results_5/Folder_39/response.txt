Message(id='msg_01V1GPQFYcKfDcghKtL4JYo7', content=[TextBlock(text='Here\'s a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    if len(sets) != 21:\n        raise ValueError("Function requires exactly 21 sets")\n    \n    original_set = set()\n    for s in sets:\n        original_set.update(s)\n    \n    return original_set\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. It uses `*sets` to accept exactly 21 sets as arguments.\n\n2. It first checks if the number of sets is exactly 21. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. It creates an empty set called `original_set`.\n\n4. It iterates through each set passed as an argument and uses the `update()` method to add all elements from each set to `original_set`.\n\n5. The resulting `original_set` will contain all unique elements from all input sets, which is the smallest set that contains all the input sets as subsets.\n\n6. It returns the `original_set`.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Exactly 21 sets are passed\n- All sets are treated as subsets of the returned set\n- The returned set is the smallest possible set containing all input sets\n- Duplicate elements are automatically removed due to the set data structure', type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=295))
