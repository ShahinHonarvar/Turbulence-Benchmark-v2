Message(id='msg_01TgUVsFKdviQGLdKD4AU52Z', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(*sets):\n    return set().union(*sets)\n```\n\nThis implementation does the following:\n\n1. The function `find_original_set` uses `*sets` to accept exactly 60 distinct sets as arguments.\n\n2. The `set().union(*sets)` method creates a new set by taking the union of all input sets.\n\n3. This ensures that the returned set contains all unique elements from all input sets.\n\n4. Since the function is guaranteed to receive 60 distinct sets, it will create the smallest set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n\nThe function works as follows:\n- If any of the input sets are subsets of others, those elements will only appear once in the result.\n- The returned set will be the smallest possible set that contains all elements from the input sets.\n- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of elements across all input sets.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=227))
