Message(id='msg_01UdS8LwKDS8FH9F5NSm3eZN', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's a Python implementation of the `find_original_set` function:\n\n```python\ndef find_original_set(set1, set2):\n    return set1.union(set2)\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes two sets as input arguments\n2. It uses the `union()` method to combine both sets\n3. The resulting set contains all unique elements from both input sets\n4. This ensures that the returned set is the smallest set that contains both input sets as subsets\n\nThe function works because:\n- `union()` creates a new set with elements from both sets\n- The resulting set will be the smallest possible set that includes all elements from both input sets\n- Each input set will be a subset of the returned set\n\nFor example:\n- `find_original_set({1, 2}, {3, 4})` would return `{1, 2, 3, 4}`\n- `find_original_set({1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5})` would return `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=110, output_tokens=254))
