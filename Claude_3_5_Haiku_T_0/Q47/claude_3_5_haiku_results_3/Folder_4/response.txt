Message(id='msg_01C3MRJ9tERDcMeKrHJr8qaa', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    s = s.lower()\n    \n    for length in range(17, 67):\n        for start in range(12, 93 - length + 1):\n            substring = s[start:start+length]\n            \n            if all(char.isalpha() for char in substring):\n                if substring == substring[::-1]:\n                    palindromes.add(substring)\n    \n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It initializes an empty set `palindromes` to store the unique palindromes.\n\n2. It converts the input string to lowercase to perform case-insensitive matching.\n\n3. It iterates through possible palindrome lengths from 17 to 66 (inclusive).\n\n4. For each length, it checks substrings starting from index 12 to index 92 minus the length plus 1.\n\n5. For each substring, it first checks if all characters are English letters using `isalpha()`.\n\n6. If all characters are letters, it checks if the substring is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.\n\n7. If a palindrome is found, it is added to the `palindromes` set.\n\n8. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Only substrings from index 12 to 92 are considered\n- Only palindromes with lengths between 17 and 66 are included\n- Only palindromes consisting of English letters are added\n- The search is case-insensitive\n- If no palindromes are found, an empty set is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=401))
