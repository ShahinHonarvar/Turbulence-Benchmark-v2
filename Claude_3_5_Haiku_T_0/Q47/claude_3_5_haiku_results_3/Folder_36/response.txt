Message(id='msg_019iyXQK8AfksuffPUFx3bin', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = s[124:284].lower()\n    \n    for length in range(115, 135):\n        for start in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            candidate = substring[start:start+length]\n            \n            if all(char.isalpha() for char in candidate):\n                if candidate == candidate[::-1]:\n                    palindromes.add(candidate)\n    \n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a string `s` as input.\n\n2. It creates an empty set `palindromes` to store the found palindromes.\n\n3. It extracts the substring from index 124 to 283 (inclusive) and converts it to lowercase to perform case-insensitive matching.\n\n4. It iterates through palindrome lengths from 115 to 134 (inclusive).\n\n5. For each length, it slides a window of that length across the substring.\n\n6. For each window, it checks if all characters are English letters.\n\n7. If all characters are letters, it checks if the substring is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.\n\n8. If a palindrome is found, it is added to the `palindromes` set.\n\n9. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function meets all the specified requirements:\n- Considers only the substring from index 124 to 283\n- Finds palindromes of lengths between 115 and 134\n- Only includes palindromes consisting of English letters\n- Performs case-insensitive matching\n- Returns an empty set if no palindromes are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=407))
