Convert the input string to lowercase to perform case-insensitive matching.\n2. Initialize an empty set to store palindromes.\n3. Iterate through possible starting indices from 0 to 50.\n4. For each starting index, check palindromes of lengths from 50 to 100.\n5. Extract the substring of the specified length.\n6. Check if the substring is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.\n7. Check if the substring consists only of alphabetic characters.\n8. If both conditions are met, add the palindrome to the set.\n9. Return the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Only substrings from index 0 to 50 are considered\n- Only palindromes of lengths 50 to 100 are included\n- Only palindromes consisting of English letters are returned\n- The matching is case-insensitive\n- An empty set is returned if no palindromes meet the criteria", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=360))
