Message(id='msg_0194XMbuePhsh4xRfTGv1svV', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    substring = s[65:100].lower()\n    \n    for length in range(26, 34):\n        for start in range(len(substring) - length + 1):\n            candidate = substring[start:start+length]\n            if candidate == candidate[::-1] and candidate.isalpha():\n                palindromes.add(candidate)\n    \n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It takes a string `s` as input.\n\n2. It creates an empty set `palindromes` to store the unique palindromes.\n\n3. It extracts the substring from index 65 to 99 (inclusive) and converts it to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n\n4. It iterates through palindrome lengths from 26 to 33 (inclusive).\n\n5. For each length, it slides a window of that length across the substring.\n\n6. For each window, it checks if the substring is:\n   - A palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards)\n   - Consists only of alphabetic characters\n\n7. If a substring meets these conditions, it is added to the `palindromes` set.\n\n8. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function handles the requirements by:\n- Focusing only on the substring from index 65 to 99\n- Considering only palindromes of lengths 26 to 33\n- Ensuring palindromes consist only of letters\n- Performing case-insensitive matching\n- Returning an empty set if no palindromes are found", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=392))
