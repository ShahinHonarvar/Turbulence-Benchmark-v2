Message(id='msg_01TMJ8DwvurTNRutw5jmpCiu', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the specified function:\n\n```python\ndef palindromes_of_specific_lengths(s):\n    palindromes = set()\n    s = s.lower()\n    \n    for start in range(14, 91 - 54):\n        for length in range(55, 72):\n            substring = s[start:start+length]\n            \n            if len(substring) == length and substring.isalpha():\n                if substring == substring[::-1]:\n                    palindromes.add(substring)\n    \n    return palindromes\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. It initializes an empty set `palindromes` to store the unique palindromes.\n\n2. It converts the input string to lowercase to perform case-insensitive matching.\n\n3. It uses nested loops to:\n   - Iterate through possible starting indices from 14 to 90 - 54 (to ensure enough length for palindromes)\n   - Iterate through palindrome lengths from 55 to 71\n\n4. For each iteration, it extracts a substring of the specified length.\n\n5. It checks if the substring:\n   - Has the exact specified length\n   - Contains only alphabetic characters using `isalpha()`\n   - Is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse\n\n6. If a substring meets all conditions, it is added to the `palindromes` set.\n\n7. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.\n\nThe function ensures that:\n- Only palindromes in the substring from index 14 to 90 are considered\n- Only palindromes with lengths between 55 and 71 are included\n- Only palindromes consisting of English letters are returned\n- The search is case-insensitive\n- If no palindromes are found, an empty set is returned", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=207, output_tokens=420))
