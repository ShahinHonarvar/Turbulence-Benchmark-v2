The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list as input.\n\n2. It initializes an empty `result` list to store sublists with a product of 29.\n\n3. It uses nested loops to generate all possible contiguous sublists in the circular list:\n   - The outer loop `start` determines the starting point of the sublist.\n   - The inner loop `end` determines the ending point of the sublist.\n\n4. For each sublist, it calculates the product of its elements:\n   - It uses modulo arithmetic `i % length` to wrap around the list, simulating a circular list.\n   - It builds the sublist and calculates its product.\n\n5. If the product of the sublist equals 29, the sublist is added to the `result` list.\n\n6. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing all sublists with a product of 29.\n\nThe function handles circular lists by using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list indices, ensuring that sublists can span across the list's boundaries.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=214, output_tokens=411))
