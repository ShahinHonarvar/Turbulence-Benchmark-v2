It defines an inner helper function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The `gcf_two_nums` function takes a list of positive integers as input.\n3. It directly calls the `gcd` function with the integers at indices 95 and 85 from the input list.\n4. The function returns the greatest common factor (GCD) of those two numbers.\n\nThe implementation uses the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently calculate the GCD, which works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero.", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=102, output_tokens=229))
