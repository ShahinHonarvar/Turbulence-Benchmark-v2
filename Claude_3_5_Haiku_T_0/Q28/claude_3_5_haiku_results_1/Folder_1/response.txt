Message(id='msg_013aF45Df8Un1btxYseruDdE', content=[TextBlock(text="Here's the Python implementation of the function based on the specification:\n\n```python\ndef return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):\n    subset = s[21:60]\n    sorted_subset = sorted(subset)\n    return sorted_subset[10]\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n1. It takes a string `s` as input\n2. Creates a subset of the string from index 21 to 59 (inclusive) using slice notation `s[21:60]`\n3. Sorts the subset of characters using the `sorted()` function, which will order them by their ASCII values\n4. Returns the 11th character (index 10) from the sorted subset, which represents the 11th smallest ASCII value\n\nThe function assumes that:\n- The input string has at least 60 characters\n- The characters in the subset are distinct (as specified in the problem statement)\n- The 11th smallest character can be retrieved from the sorted subset", type='text')], model='claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=Usage(input_tokens=119, output_tokens=216))
