Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-51, -17, -3, -3, -51, -1, -1, -17]


The correct answer was:

[[-51], [-51], [-51, -1, -1]]

But the LLM code returned:
[[-51], [-51]]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

[-1, -3, -3, -17, -1, -51, -51, -17]
