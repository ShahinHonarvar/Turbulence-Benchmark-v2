Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-65, -13, -5, -5, -65, -1, -1, -13]


The correct answer was:

[[-65], [-65], [-65, -1, -1]]

But the LLM code returned:
[[-65], [-65]]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:

[-1, -5, -5, -13, -1, -65, -65, -13]
