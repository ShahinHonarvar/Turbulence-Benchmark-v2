Additional research could extend the model to include additional species and more detailed scenarios, such as varying selection pressures or more complex genetic architectures. Furthermore, future studies could focus on promoting existing conservation efforts or developing new strategies to aid in the persistence of these species. Given their Narrow geographic ranges and specific threats, targeted conservation efforts could be more effective in ensuring the survival of these species. Furthermore, understanding the genetic diversity of these species, as well as their genetic relationships with other species, could provide valuable insights for conservation efforts and for the broader field of biodiversity conservation. Additionally, understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying selection in these populations could provide insights for understanding how selection operates in other populations and species. This work could also be extended to investigate other species in the same locations, as well as other species with similar life histories or ecological nichilities, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the structure of selection in these populations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this study provides important contributions to the understanding of differential responses to environmental change, as well as the genetic and ecological underpinnings of these responses. By providing a framework for understanding the differences in adaptive divergence between closely related species, this study could help in the development of conservation strategies for these and other closely related species. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of considering the genetic and ecological underpinnings of populations in the development of conservation efforts, as well as the potential implications of these differences for the broader field of biodiversity conservation. This work could also have important implications for the understanding of the structure of selection in other populations and species. Overall, this study provides a valuable case study for the study of differential responses to environmental change and the genetic mechanisms underlying these responses. This study could help to inform the development of conservation efforts for these and other closely related species, as well as provide insights for the broader field of biodiversity conservation. Additionally, this study could provide insights for the understanding of the structure of selection in other populations and species, including those in different environments or with different life histories or ecological characteristics. This work could also have important implications for the development of conservation efforts aimed at promoting the persistence of these and other closely related species in the face of environmental change. Understanding the differential responses to environmental change in closely related species, as well as the genetic mechanisms underlying these responses, could provide valuable information for the development of conservation efforts aimed at promoting the persistence of these and other closely related species.
