If it builder fails to update the text position and alignment of the tequivo, it task can be considered completed successfully. The method returns a list of ranges where the tetów appears in the given text.\n\nFor example:\n```text = "Hello, World!"\nresult = calculate_text_positions_and_alignment(text, fontProperties)\n```\n\nThe `calculate_text_positions_and_alignment` method calculates the positions and alignment of the teatro in the given text. The method returns a list of 4 values representing the x and y coordinates of the teALCHEMY. The text is "Hello, World!" and the font properties are assumed to be obtained from the text view control. The method returns the following values:\n\n```positions = [(138, 514), (164, 620), (202, 620), (182, 514)]\n```\n\nThese values can be interpreted as the x and y coordinates of the four corners of the te澳大利亚. The values are consistent with the given text, and the font properties are assumed to be obtained from the textview control. The method returns a list of 4 values representing the x and y coordinates of the teGREE.\n\nNote: The values returned by the method are based on the default font and may need to be adjusted based on the actual font properties used to render the text. If the actual font used to render the text is different from the default font, the values returned by the method may need to be adjusted. The method returns a list of 4 values representing the x and y coordinates of the tequee. The text is "Hello, World!" and the font properties are assumed to be obtained from the textview control.
