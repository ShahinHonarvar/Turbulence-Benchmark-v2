Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 10, 10, 5]


The correct answer was:

[[2, 5], [2, 5, 1], [1, 10], [10], [10], [5, 1, 2]]

But the LLM code returned:
[[2, 5], [1, 10], [10], [10]]
