ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-bcc3ef25dceb4562b6a03b23b4e47eb2', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    def count_submatrices_with_n_elements(mat, n):\n        count = 0\n        rows, cols = mat.shape\n        if n == 1:\n            return rows * cols\n        for r in range(rows - n + 1):\n            for c in range(cols - n + 1):\n                if (mat[r:r+n, c:c+n].size == 93):\n                    count += 1\n        return count\n    return count_submatrices_with_n_elements(matrix, 1)\n```\n\nThis solution defines the required function, but it has a mistake. The given problem specifies that we need to find submatrices containing exactly 93 integers, but the function incorrectly splits the task into submatrices of variable size `n` and then checks if the size is 93. The correct approach would be to directly look for submatrices of size 93, which is a fixed size, and adjust the loop conditions accordingly. Here is the corrected version:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    count = 0\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    for r in range(rows - 9 + 1):\n        for c in range(cols - 10 + 1):\n            if (matrix[r:r+9, c:c+10].size == 93):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis version correctly checks for submatrices of 9x10 (which contain 90 elements, not 93 as requested). Since a 93-element submatrix would have dimensions 9x11 or 3x31 or other factors of 93, you would need to determine which dimensions are appropriate given the matrix's row and column constraints. Here is the most general version:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    count = 0\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    for r in range(rows - 3 + 1):\n        for c in range(cols - 31 + 1):\n            if (matrix[r:r+3, c:c+31].size == 93):\n                count += 1\n    for r in range(rows - 9 + 1):\n        for c in range(cols - 10 + 1):\n            if (matrix[r:r+9, c:c+10].size == 93):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, name=None))], created=1730666459, model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=538, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=665, estimated_cost=0.00025965))
