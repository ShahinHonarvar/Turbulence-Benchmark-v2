The correct approach would be to check if the submatrix size is equal to the specified number of integers 'n*n' and iterate over possible sizes of submatrices if 'n' is to represent the side length. However, according to the specification, the number of integers is fixed at 97, which suggests a misunderstanding in the specification. If 'n' is meant to be the side length of the submatrix, the function call at the end should pass the correct side length, and the condition inside should check for `n*n == 97`, which is not possible for integer side lengths.
