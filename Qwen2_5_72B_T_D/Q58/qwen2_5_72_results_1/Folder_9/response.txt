If we strictly adhere to the problem statement, a submatrix containing exactly 33 integers does not form a square or rectangle of integers, but for the sake of the exercise, I'll assume 33 is the total number of elements regardless of shape. If the requirement is to find a submatrix of specific dimensions (e.g., 3x11 or 1x33), the function needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here, I'll correct it to correctly reflect the problem statement.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    count = 0\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for height in range(1, rows + 1):\n                for width in range(1, cols + 1):\n                    if i + height <= rows and j + width <= cols:\n                        submatrix = matrix[i:i + height, j:j + width]\n                        if submatrix.size == 33:\n                            count += 1\n    return count\n```", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, name=None))], created=1730666127, model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=405, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=532, estimated_cost=0.00020645000000000003))
