Since 67 is a prime number, the only submatrix that can contain exactly 67 elements is a 1x67 or 67x1, not a square submatrix. The function, however, is constructed to search for square submatrices, making the `int(np.sqrt(67))` an incorrect approach. If you need to find submatrices of exactly 67 elements regardless of their shape, the function will need to be adjusted. Here is a corrected version:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):\n    count = 0\n    rows, cols = matrix.shape\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            for k in range(1, min(rows, cols) + 1):\n                if i + k <= rows and j + k <= cols and k * k == 67:\n                    count += 1\n    return count if count > 0 else 0\n```\nHowever, since 67 is a prime number, the only valid submatrix shape is 1x67 or 67x1, so this function will not find any submatrices unless the matrix itself is of this shape. Therefore, a more appropriate approach would be to directly check for these specific dimensions.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, name=None))], created=1730667259, model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=415, prompt_tokens=127, total_tokens=542, estimated_cost=0.00021045000000000002))
