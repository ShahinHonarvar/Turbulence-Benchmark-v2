Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['$2<L39 %2x w4 U02b04=5H4 ea2 lx0n2zN 24XPR']


The correct answer was:

$2<L39 %2x w4 U02b04=5H4 ea2 lx0n2zN 24XPR

But the LLM code returned:
$2<39 %2x w4 U02b04=5H4 ea2 lx0n2zN 24XPR
