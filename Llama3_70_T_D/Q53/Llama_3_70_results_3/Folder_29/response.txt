It checks if each substring is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same backwards as forwards) and consists only of English letters. If a substring meets these conditions, it is added to the `result` set. The function returns the `result` set, which contains all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 78 that exist in the given string.",
