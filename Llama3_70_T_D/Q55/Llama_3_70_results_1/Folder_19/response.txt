If yes, it appends the sublist to the result list. However, this function may not work correctly for larger lists due to its time complexity. Also, the function does not handle cases where the product of a sublist equals -54 but the sublist contains non-contiguous elements. \n\nTo improve the function, we should consider using a more efficient algorithm with a lower time complexity. One possible improvement is to use a rolling product approach, where we keep track of the product of the current sublist and update it as we move to the next element. However, implementing such an improvement is out of the scope of this task. \n\nAlso, note that the provided function returns sublists of any size as long as their product equals -54, but it does not guarantee that the sublists are contiguous. If contiguity is a requirement, the function should be modified to keep track of the start index of the current sublist and append elements to it until the product equals -54 or exceeds it. \n\nFinally, the function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-integer elements. Depending on the requirements, the function may need to be modified to handle such cases. \n\nConsidering these points, the function provided above may not meet all the requirements of the task and may need further modifications.",
