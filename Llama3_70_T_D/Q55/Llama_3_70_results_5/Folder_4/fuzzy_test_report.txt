Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[1, 7, 7, 13, 1, 91, 91, 13]


The correct answer was:

[[7, 13], [7, 13, 1], [1, 91], [91], [91], [13, 1, 7]]

But the LLM code returned:
[[7, 13], [7, 13, 1], [1, 91], [91], [91], [13, 7]]
