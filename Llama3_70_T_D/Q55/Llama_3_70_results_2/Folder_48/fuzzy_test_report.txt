Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[2, 18, 33, 1, 198, 990, 55, 33, 11, 6, 198, 990, 495, 9, 110, 30, 330, 5, 66, 22, 330, 5, 18, 6, 66, 9, 55, 99, 30, 99, 90, 10, 22, 110, 15, 165, 45, 45, 495, 10, 165, 2, 11, 15, 90, 3, 3, 1]


The correct answer was:

[[990], [990], [9, 110]]

But the LLM code returned:
[[990], [990], [110, 9]]
