Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758, 622, 258, 910, 982, 812, 903, 317]


The correct answer was:

[2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, 47, 53, 67, 73, 83, 97, 113, 137, 167, 173, 197, 223, 283, 313, 317, 337, 347, 353, 367, 373, 383, 397, 443, 467]

But the LLM code returned:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379]
