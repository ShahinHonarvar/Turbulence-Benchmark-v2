Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['7,gm(XNvY?O (!B,9kHc a> {$2(^5J (`]R\\\\k $E&@|0{0[tD|Z^O;X&Q M>)%i lr:M%WG; 8 rxbu\\5QJ;K[  $N<`^1n']


The correct answer was:

[]

But the LLM code returned:
[' $N<`^1n']
