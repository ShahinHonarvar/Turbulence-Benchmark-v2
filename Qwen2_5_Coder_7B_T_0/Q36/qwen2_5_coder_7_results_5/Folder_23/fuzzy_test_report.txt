Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['lPfDRZ%77 h> 8 0 360 @>0s5 h   8S2Y9B4 r19&zU$e>sV & hcd69 2K3F76Y+587  ']


The correct answer was:

lPfDRZ%77 h 8 0 360 @05 h   8S2Y9B4 r19&zU$eV & hcd69 2K3F76Y+587  

But the LLM code returned:
lPfDRZ%77 h 8 0 360 05 h   8S2Y9B4 r19&zU$eV & hcd69 2K3F76Y+587
