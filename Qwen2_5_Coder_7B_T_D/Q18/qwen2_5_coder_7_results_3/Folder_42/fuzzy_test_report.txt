Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[12, -440, 74, -240, 91, 531, -549, -88, 202, -105, -8, 454, 283, -31, 184, 357, 404, -26, 53, 121, 5, 281, -193, -266, -275, -340, 407, 341, -112, -73, 401, 130, 438, -26, 442, 241, -209, -217, -264, 335, 252, -282, 312, 513, -535, 448, 450]
