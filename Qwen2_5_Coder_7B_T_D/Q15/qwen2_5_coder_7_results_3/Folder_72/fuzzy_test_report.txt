Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[283, 341, 454, 74, 5, 531, -275, -26, 448, 12, 202, -462, -31, -240, 404, 281, 53, -112, -73, -105, -282, -266, -198, 91, -193, 333, -88, 401, 121, -58, -549, -8, 450, 252, -440, 312, 513, -288, 357, 407, 184, 130, -535, 438, 514, -26, -340, 442, 241, -209, -217, -264, 335]


The correct answer was:

8

But the LLM code returned:
1010
